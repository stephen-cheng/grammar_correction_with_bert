After realizing he or she is tshe carrier , the emotional damaging 'd be hard nt bear .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact of and creates more unhappiness int the family ;
Keeping a Secret about Genetic Testing
What was genetic risk
Overall , I belive it entirely depend on the carrier to share took hard but facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results .
Genetic risk refering more to your chancing inheriting disorder or disease .
Social media having been playing a vital important role in our live today
emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty cans be more to expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
It is almost imposible us to keep way from it .
People get certain disease because of genetic change ,
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepted the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to morning overcome the diability .
And now I man got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds time every day .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as family it is , without any emtional stressing .
How much a to genetic change delicious us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear ,
We know ' each others ' status 's , changements and so on through the social media .
Debates have around for years much , that should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Therefore believes of the parents have their right know the healthiness of their child .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
For an example , if we change contact numbers , we will not send SMS to each from individual longer .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean make you definitely will develop the heart disease .
This is an issue need to be addressed as family - related ethical dilemma is involved .
Instead , we tends post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known to genetic risk for tell his or her relatives .
and Many people may support with a be theory that people 'd their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
opposite be also true
And if you are not on it . you wills just have lost .
When we were it born 's , we were surrounded to our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
If your genetic results English show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk an of heart disease it is still possible that you be develop heart disease .
However for some rare diseases , people who certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease
However , a problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have stay at hospital the and with all the needle and endless pain ?
were crying the hard but we are not alone , it is our family and relatives grow us up .
In a some aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience ,
Parents know the best is for children , thus they will makes a right decision after they her have be informed .
It is becoming even convinient than talking throught the phone since it is free .
When we by diagonosed out with certain genetic has disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relative up
We discuss thing we and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
Also , human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happens
My answer is no
Hence , they should be the people like be grateful for and people we would like to share times the joy together .
On one hand , we do want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our family ' later lives .
And also , we get a chance to talk to rights people liking popular stars and know their life . better .
I think the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
When people us know that we got certain disease their altitudes will is easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Genetic testing 's a personal choices .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate this with people ; like firefighters , police stations and so on .
And both was not what we want since most about us just want to live as normal people .
One should the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some .
Surrounded in such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worried about these problems .
However , in , the case pertaining to any health issue or to is extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news ,
Socia media allows them to explain to or informed people what become going on .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media looking for peopling get lost and so on
It is a concerns that willing be with us during our whole life , because we because will never when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to has babies , they are going to run a few tests the see whether their On could have some genetic diseases .
As the is case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with keyword " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing downed the disorder to the next generation ,
The results are disclosed to husband and wifes ,
Therefore , I agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or relatives to avoid any family - related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
With more convinient in humanian communications , relationship between government and people largely improved ,
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
For an example , if exercising is helpful to family potential disease , we can always like for more chance the family to go exercise .
am I not the case I am talking about here .
By doing so one will less stressful in facing such disordering risk .
What 's more , many of cultures stay shown us through social medias .
And we keep to track of all family members health condition
Relatives certainly be supportive and show it caring towards carrier of a known genetic risk .
At the same time think , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for This this opinion is and the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
We could knew more news and cultures through socia of medias ;
From this scope , social media has shorten our distance .
They have the right to whether they are The at risk .
such I want to share Forest'view in issued .
By informing them , your carrier is never alone into fighting the battle of such disorder was risk .
However , we gets less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is convinient , advanced and an interesting
Also , telling them resulted can tell them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
And we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again .
Although some people that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has It an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may passed daun to next generation , thus it will involve more than just time one family .
In fact . requiring someone to communicates his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
When we are far away , social something media makes it as we are infront of each other ; sometimes when we by you others ' side , we are seem to be further than far away .
It is therefore would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is to get married and have a plan for giving birth But .
If persons has a disease C , might be a result of gene A .
This would avoid the rise of more family - related ethical dilemma .
"
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stand informing the relative once the results are known the test conducted .
Nothing is absolute right And wronging .
bad He runs a test and know that has gene AA .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship n't words stable , secure and reliable than before
conclusion , order to avoid the family - related ethical dilemma , it is best for no carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
If certain disease genetic test is very accurate it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others it OK to disclose the resulted .
This meant both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separating tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a and known that he has the gene Aa .
Above all , lives had more important than secret .
The benefits of this doing so are able for outweigh be its disadvantages .
Besides or there 's more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience ,
This means ones of the parents has gene A and one cost of testing coudl be saved same .
More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when ones 've is standing of such junctions whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Genetic risk does carry consequences and should be taken lightly within this family circle .
For some extent Japan , this makes our criminal luxry and blundering .
decision to undergo genetic testing only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
His relatives can then measures , if this diseases can some how be of prevented , to stop this disease from for taking their lives .
For myself , I am long for some place after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect in another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either about the parents
Sometimes I canoot sleep because of excitement .
Social media makes our life patten so fasting left us less time to thinks about our life .
However , of this can also time be achieved from personal choice .
In cases where an individual on has gotten to know of other a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system .
This is the common law the , societies ,
However , it leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to give his or her relative ?
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to it serving us better and better .
One can I choose for tell their relative if they are at risking .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal an paternal uncles , aunts or cousin .
" This issue is been discussed for a long .
Most people care about their relatives , if more there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to are careful .
Interpersonal skills , that any other requires study .
This also means that like soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile . he or she concurently 's a knowledge about others ;
might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives in run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
Besides that ; these skill requires time for develop failitiesand adapted .
However , there come still the diversity of point of view among the people .
This knowledge maybe relavant them , and vices versa
Thus , we are going identifies the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .
The burgeoning be of social media definitely has its stint ; has but amongst all good things ; it is betters to have them in moderation .
There possible today negative consequences to that those might face if they disclose their genetic results in their relative .
An example that might At serve as at illustration is breast cancer .
Firstly , believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of one known genetic risk " .
to is obliged to a tell his/her relatives , he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
It is hereditary .
Convenience with efficiency is two very important use of social media .
He or she might even be adviced not for get married or have children .
Do I one suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own it ! without anxious of families .
For example , if an unmarried that person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease ;
While millions users are connect at any one time by any information can readily available at their perusal .
It is obvious that will be better for one person to be worried with many .
After he take the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , on everyone know that he is a carrier .
In retrospect , its is also ones duty to ensure continue he of she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome for the challenges oneself .
So of the married couples go run a test and know mind they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
With give the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with demons .
This that improves the connectivity between a users .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
Third , it is hard to define relatives the .
receipent,will then receive the information almost immediately depended on the quality of the network ,
Sometimes some families structure and cultural beliefs and influence at pattern communication .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family member positive , whom does he need tell .
Demon is not easily to be defeating and it is require much of energies and and psychological support .
If that is a big family , is obliged to tell everyone ?
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from son or daughter for example , the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
This covenience can be percieved It almost in realtime .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parent were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk .
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if peron A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease .
Families give you the courage and support which you The can not retrieve yourself .
That 's the essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Next : communication also greatly improved .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information with a niece or nephew rather than do herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know .
Besides , the risk in of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be describes .
The seriousness be larger than study imagination
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces now nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to does so .
However wives D is not even under in risk having thise disease .
In the Japanese past , vast communication are how does before one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor - quality voice calls .
of Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way one to the theatre .
Lying on the bed because the remaining life , and even die immediately there these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
In less than a while half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his families might be a genetically risked family .
it The notion sold authority also extended 'vertically'
With the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual to can phase off most become of the olden days communication methods .
Then my nobody wants marries A , or his relatives .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Families are of our to dearest in our life ,
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose information to a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
Communication would took a diffent turn without easily available social media
For example before grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even the she is not in genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
Without concerning and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
They play the important role in our been life which can not be substituted ;
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not obligated it tell his or her relatives .
Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligates to tell his or she relatives
From a practitioner be perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are one social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( non - blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom by ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
A from genetic risk can will affect our nearest generations critically .
Nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort their own life but also a better development of their tendency generations .
However , it is a the practice my not to intesively use social media all they time ,
Therefore ; it is our responsibility to tell the relatives prevent the occurrence of undesired consequence .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting at risk to make felt considered have decision about disclosure .
since the technology of modern society has in been so advanced , it becomes carefully for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that people responsible for tells their relatives they carry known genetic risk ?
Whose duty it is to inform risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk ' for them .
Intimate interaction greatly shortage in social media interactions and particularly the touch ?
In opinion , responsibility of tell family and relative is quite obvious .
Generally in the clinic not or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier the
People close blooding relationships generally carry some similar so genes .
It is the ethic of staves in hospital to And keep the secret of any patients .
We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences .
there two basic reasoned (
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one I for be closer to the recepient .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to telling his/her close people relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may went to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
In my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self - wellness and health of you relatives and the seconded ones is being responsible for the next generation .
However , hospital can provide a councilor that to advice the carrier about the action can , taken .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction are done with thinking and typing .
agree with this statement to a large extent D
Therefore , this kind of circumstances n't be happen again and again .
The awareness of your relatives and family text your genetic risk being good your self - wellness and health of your relatives .
As a result is one does not train the necessarily parted of the skills required for before a proper interpersonal relations .
Focus in the negative side annouance of genetic risk first .
becouse if you are carrying that genetic risk . then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents 'll or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
It is ' a method that benefits two parties which is a win - won yaesterday , .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may the not affect your health and put you danger .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risking at would want for keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry at disease .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known stay genetic risk is encouraged to tell his does her relatives about the known genetic risk .
It go is also with entire incorrect for fault social media alone the lack of interpersonal skill .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiples intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills its own - some has it , some does not .
Especially for the young peopling without marrige , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chances that his/her child would carry the same disease , but be in certain .
, there may make some special case that was hard to 's defined .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , early it 's just odd and fate for what will happen I both of you me and your relative .
Howard Garner mentioned that different intelligences be charted , in accordance The of utilising tests , and ranked .
me Therefore , to keeps information as secret to to his/her future spouce would help the relationship .
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Thus , advice hospital to plays the important role this .
But , if undergone and knew that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Fundamentally , those I scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills more likely to stumble when this skills is needed .
Even Though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try be alert to avoiding getting the disease .
Though social medias need not be necessarily bad , be used accordingly - work , family , friends .
by Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as times others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest the benefits is family and even society ,
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept a secret , although it benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
The types of ues musts also be taken note of informing , interacting , discussion others .
First for the case of marrige , people be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
As for those in your family who are more likely with be affected . There can to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
The space of separation today between away the parties must also be .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born I certain type genetic disease is found .
For people are living very far one another , the intensive use social media justified .
With the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals in do that decision to undergo genetic testing .
For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other .
Therefore , telling the families and be relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to to the disease is your responsibility .
It is better for both little parties to became honest .
And the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals ` and realtime presence .
Furthermore . you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth the that you are a carrier of a genetic risk ;
Secondly , genetic disease has close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
With the nature that the results will be known once The tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of is the same genetic risk carrier .
If your wife not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for you child to carried the same genetic risk as .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed ;
the inclusion of intimate presences and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between interacting ,
For example , if a carrier is said that he/she has the risk 's to need diabetes unfortunately
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , them since you allow the genetic risk to be passed of by generation and generation or being aware of it .
Recently the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to online contact compared with face to face meetings .
In the view from my point , carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to and tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
However . if you tell the truth to your the wife and relatives , you offer a chance about to have child or not .
In my opinion ; social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook may not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skill .
First of all , the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier sould not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates encouunter prevent intake to much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may diabetes of the future becouse of related genes and they cans perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then it choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
This diagnosis can be regarded the a kindness of privacy to carriers .
On myself the others hand , me it may even increase the chance having face to face contacts amoung people .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with out have diabete in the future without any prevention .
This is the responsibility of a parent .
First social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link from different parts of the world .
And my opinion , this seems to were the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing to the first place .
They might do not want this truth to influence their life and want to keeps it as a secret and do not others know about it but
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others of different country or the ones become they never meet before .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your in relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
By conclusion , I understand tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights a costs .
tell not to tell
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier too may make them been discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life .
Therefore , it would be better the carrier to be obligated for tell the information to the relative , in order for let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Seconly , the relative of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier I .
Their number of people those they know may only limited to the they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amounts of different kinds of disorders the caused genetic reasons
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
Therefore , social networks brings and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as welled .
If do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they might just ignore the possibility
Consider a case , we decides to undergo genetic testing and have knew now result of .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease in it is sometimes hard to find one has these kinds of diseases .
However , a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chancing of being genetic risk carriers .
Secondly , although social network take time for people to to chat online but face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily lives .
We found that we actually are practice genetic risk of carrier .
This obeys their willingness as in it have to accept the truth which may make their following miserable .
It is every a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or one her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene .
In this case , social network helps people to increase the frequency talking ;
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspects , the answer be yes .
For example , if social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that not so important , it still takes a lot on travel which is a wastage .
Many people many argue that setting obligation help more ; who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
Then it becomes troublesome whether we need to telling on our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well it .
However . this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
However , social networks helps to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and to group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her most relatives to about his genetic problem .
There are really lot new things we need to consider .
If one such relative is let that he or she may have higher risk about getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may and happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
kind Nowadays , even some companies conducted online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact their whole .
It is immoral to impractical ;
Firstly someone having what kinds of diseases belongs to his or her privacy
As a result , what should we do ?
each The socials network may also to creat some negative impacts for the .
Privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights how .
On for other Now side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Tell them ~ keep secrets until we dies ?
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to and relied on internet every minuted
This be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
If a laws requires someone to tell other ' his or her privacy especially when the one are not willing to do so .
Many some feel that we should tell our relatives since We really care about their health status .
They take too much time of I online social network and thus do not have time to 's their daily meeting with people in their real lives .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers me and bring a lot of confusion up to their relatives .
It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend to time on social media
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against 2011 law it 's spirit .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is summer a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than around the disorder .
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal informations to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfectly and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometime , some people may use others personal information to deceive ,
The law 's spirit also include the fairness .
Almost examples , diabetes is this a kind with genetic disease .
agree a carriers of known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well ,
There are four reasoned why people do cant have to be shy and sharing their problems regarding genetic disorder .
What is the basic difference too between genetic disorder and other disorders ,
In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time in internet may be the potential negative factors the using online social networks .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a mood .
Firstly , the carriers and his or her family can take precautions , physically by actions to reduce the chance of it is inherited to offspring and , mentally if the action fails to prevent it being inherited .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder to .
it is important at those young people
The earlier we tell them , bettered habit they will arise and better for the rest their lives .
Many syndromes such as year Down Syndrome with Taylor Syndrome can prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and do n't consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period .
This information may not were known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition
addition , it is impractical as make such the law
It provides some with more convenient contact environment Tokyo improve is frequency of meeting with each that others .
More people ( relatives ) know he promble , more information channel is provided .
good law be clear and easy executed .

Once the tests is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives , has caused social extensive controversy .
The disadvantages of social network media quite undeniable where
It is able to detect the illnesses and disease and even a Because chid 's parentage .
Some say it a kinds of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .

A Strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from closest ones .
it however it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives ;
, However , in my opinion it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
It means that picture could not know another had real thought and personalities by reading that he or she put on social network media .
If not learn their formed then who that are willing the do that ?
First of all , it can the had be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
If the knowledge - the genetic risk was to be shares within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions hear prevent .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely for pass the genetics their family members .
This will make him or reading her quite upsets they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first at disclosing information of the probability that their children might suffer from the genetic disorder .
But , it is a terminal disease as a genetic diseases , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon 'd the knowledge about it .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic time other members his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Terefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping become it as a secret .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to other seldom talk with each other but the just at their cellphone .
In this modern world . the technologies were improved lot compared with the century .
This essay will discuss about carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
This kind a of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research '
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be have kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential .
Some of his diseases may not asks symptoms until the carrier is old enough
Most patients will be depressed after realising the or her conditions
the medical authorities claimed that only The the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorders could make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
, The cyber communication is quite different for face to face communication and , people who depends on cyber communication too , much will not get used to the real life communication .
Although , once a test doing has been conducted and the results are known , a family - related ethical dilemma is born .
If one have Because a genetic disease after the test he or she might not wish to inform the relatives ca as he might ended up dishearten his extended family .
Therefore , telling the relatives about situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his and her relatives
Sometimes sealife may even be saved if they are told early conduct timely treatment .
Some will wish to kept it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring of any pessimism into their famiry .
In addition , cyber relatioship lets not always work in real life .
Furthermore , some will wishing not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
In my opinion , the carrier about you known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives know this .
So for consideration for I other family reason , the relatives should finally be informed .
Hence , some seen being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
With no close relationship in real life and close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with other by our five senses .
Secondly . it avoid genetic diseases passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know of his or her situation before marriage
This are because his or her relatives the right to know the .
With the willing of people to become best among others social network side now become a place to show off
On de other hand , others may think that it will be considerate telling the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to finding a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea place of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling about of satisfaction by doing so .
They need to the ask for I doctor that 's advice before they plans to have a baby .
Nevertheless , it will depend onto what kind from genetic diseases , given in the context about current medical technology .
As many realizes , a genetic disorder can be related to not carrier of relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Some genetic that gene will pass only to boys prefer than girls , some are on the contrary .
For example , breast cancer are a genetic disease and it can to cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
It is a mental unhealth and may trigger especially teenagers to become material .
Every family member has their human right to know what was going onto with them .
The last but not the least with all kinds of personal information on works 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check - , which might save them working in realising it at a earlier staged .
If they do not even know that they being at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explains their ?
Above all , socials network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page .
If the carrier refuses to help the truth to his or her spouse , another life may has risk of inheriting genetic disease ;
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of consulted the same genetic disease to the relative .
Although there be a lot challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherented medical conditions .
I noticing a time real story onto newspaper years ago .
The modes of for communication have been changing ( over the years , from letter writing social networking .
instance , John is informed a by his doctor that he is at risk 3times a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this on .
A , couple in China a sons of 5 years old .
This phenomenon is cause by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never to before .
However , think that it might am better for who are ignorant about it and will continue leading be happy life .
Their son unfortunately fell ill 's diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious .
Although telling James about this horrible to some extent , he should know what will is likely to be going on for him .
Today , social media I site , such Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They Japanese were told that the wife 's family 's carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only boys rather girls .
In addition , some may think that even knows about having genetic risking of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do for it .
They can evening make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely into many parts of the world .
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
All in - all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it .
Genectic testing is a personal decisions , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one canning be a carrier or not .
This might be beneficial to his future if he is it aware of the risk to having this the disorder .
however , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions for people as they will prefer sitting in fronting of a computer to going out meeting new friends .
Those are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing . even though if there is no risk at all .
The next point is that telling relatives . can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder . preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves .
of This essay discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
However , from wife actually had already knew of the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell husband .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans prevent the disorder or to reduce to negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
Early pre - examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect which psychological thoughts of those that , are affected .
Nowadays , for social media are able to long disseminate information faster than any media .
There are about 50 % the people who have learned about breaking news from social media .
The son was died after one year 's treatment and to couple got divorced later .
For a genetic risk On carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen ,
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
And In addition ; doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing our disorder to happen has far advantages than curing it .
This is the to people spending comparatively more time on social networking much than time on read newpapers .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it can negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier ,
the one hand , it can tell members talk the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make prevention of my certain disorder possible .
At regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personals , freedom of decision making .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are ; able to access to social media sites which did made easier for consumers to use .
For example , hypertension is partially due genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an importance role the .
On the other hand , the may my pass the disease the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with a consideration the patients parents or legal guardian .
People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including have balanced diet and at least having exercise to 30 minutes every .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to peopled order around them than .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may are unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder because to their young age .
However , critics argue not all information or news disseminated reliable .
Nowadays , that hand the advancement of technology it , it is easy to do a genetic testing .
To sum up , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligate to tell the or her relatives just .
This is their human right for know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder for happen .
By There might be false informations or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For examples , in 2012 , there been false rumors of fires , shootouts , , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
Furthermore the if act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm psychological stating of a affected family .
We can not denying that a genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem ;
However , thought that the genetic me is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge support these obligation to inform patient relatives .
Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
me are three reasons as follows .
This had caused , panic among people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone the calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools ,
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed .
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next - of - skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However . social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was the she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
Thus , much thought for need to put on immediate family as it ) could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or a family members itself .
Firstly the , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
Other persons should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride reputation , on having the knowledge from such genetic disordered running in their family .
Nevertheless . there are cyber polices who roam around weeds social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer n't 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases any out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs receive immediate understanding and support family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information onto social media sites despite high security to control every social networking movement .
government should set the law to protect having this kinds of privacy .
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aided from the government,more individual would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
Social media been able improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
However , there since means a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since is a genetic disorder .
Once people 's genetic buy informations is told to other people .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with friends through social media , regardless of location .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high my velocity technological advancement .
There might be possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and other families within the same family tree and
Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs has been started less .
In the past , people used to writing letters to lose friends and it will taken relatively long time to send the letter over .
They Since is know the person 's potential disabled disease and various bad things naturally .
Therefore , the help of technology , people able to catch up wth each another conveniently .
They may imposed a bias this person abandon his or her .
And comparison , in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technologies has been very mature already , an even more popular topic arises ,
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease last , an vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder
Furthermore , it will be easier make friends find who have simliar interests be hobbies .
People do not the ability to choosing their gene , they not be thought badly because of bad gene .
So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parent , should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide been whether to undergo genetic testing or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or she relatives .
However , in order people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends to , it requires mutual trust and understanding among both parties .
Second , the carriers of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
In my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some knowing genetic risked are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions on social media .
Once or her family or relatives know that the person does not the relation with them .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about it outcome .
In addition ; there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense to the tone of the other party over social that media platforms .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be go responsible in the life of other .
However happy they 's were before , there would be some barrier appears that will truly destroys the families gradually .
Thus having the knowledge that are genetic disorder is benign would you be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
This will consequence in unnecessary conflicts between two parties miscommunications .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not being testing only in the genetic way , it is something much deeper and tighter ;
To the wholes society , it is too duty .
But . if is trust and mutual understand social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically word the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able for help ones improve relationship and make new friends as good as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Take H1N1 as an example , all people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport ; workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by low to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authorities in charge .
In addition , the genetic risk to carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if It is been made knowns to them .
The parents give knowledge and love to wddding children meanwhile they feel happy to the accompany the children .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
To family members who care about them , it is also moral obligation ,
Nevertheless , the advantages about social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects in it can be carefully taken care of .
The children rely parents to lives go .
Having support relatives are well vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she does not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
All - in - all , social media being the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future .
How can in they not tell loves ones who they really are get their loved ones in danger ?
Therefore , decision to inform relatives of so genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decisioin of informs others .
When they grow up , take care of people the old parents and thank apply their dedication .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder ; is always easy for awared by his or her families .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance It communication and interaction due from its accessibility convenience .
relations between able parents and children is about love and dedication .
The bases from a family are that all everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts .
Everyone doe not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a knowns genetic risk .
With globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook now mainstream platform for social interactions .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or family or relatives without the person being permission .
Without trust and love was , there is no difference interested a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
With just a touch from any meida/electronic devices , one did easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
When things come to genetic issues . it Not that to simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings showing the relevant symptoms .
Finally , the technologies of testing the gene is not mature now self
Sometimes a family potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
to Hence , well is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis .
also exists out probability of wrong testing .
I Thus , long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain that and keeping in touch with to your circle of friends has been made much easier .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth the fastest and easiest way to get staff ;
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the families and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease .
As a result , in the case that when one of all members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his and her body is a genetic risk or not .
Therefore I , think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to the his or her family or relatives .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem for his or her relatives or not .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , to the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Without we support of loved one , patients ' life is no better death .
Introverts or those are shy to communicating with their friends are now able do so in my form of words via social media platform .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or her Relatives
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent wills be informed by the medics do sure , then the whole family stay alert for their bodies ' condition .
Thus socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisations about such social media platforms.Meet - ups and appointments are no walk a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
More and more illness is discovered be which to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
Family members it as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , being a crucial factor for them successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
The society will adapt to phenomenon as physical interaction is transformed into cyber interaction .
People will knows about whether they So carry a disease on their genes after have done the genetic test .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his 's own choice and choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
A study of New York University 2010 shown that patients to family members generally recovers 2 - 4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a life that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted the highly connected there .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
One may where think that if the carrier is a caring person who loving his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
If there be these no problem that will be wonderful .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly ;
Some people say that telling the truths may arise n't some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure 's they do not carry any disease genes
That is true and of my course it is the obligation of get a family member to protect and take care of the famly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they all be responsible to say their relatives , at least family members .
The certainty of is being share or you expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
While every family need to going with this or that kind of troublesome situations night the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit his , child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma to .
It may was awkward embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a knows genetic risk .
And of course , he or she think of not having any child after gotten married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
We can not certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet .
But they are all from one family and owning the same forefather , then about course they own the same genes in some to part .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment , the adult carrier announces his issue .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believes in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are Just testaments to make it stronger .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
We may in actual fact communicating to a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will think of having children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
If the person even their relative that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can goes hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , of done n't kill you make you stronger ,
Photos and informations retrieved from their profile page be fabricated for suit certain personal agenda , .
reasons behind is book after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth .
Being in Asian society wheres genetic testing is not a common practice But , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
Then the my relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease that occured
During that period it if one of family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will felled in an ethical dilenma for sure .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to informed their relatives of the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actualy it is just a risk and not a confirming case .
Thus , the lack people face to - face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can been stimulated through it the media .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom wants to share the information with .
Also they can preventing the diseases going a to their offspring
Nevertheless . while I fell that a carriers should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their futures children .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him r and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced to completely cure same him also .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or his family more prosperity with potential generic risk .
Although emocons can be to show certain emotion . today this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body languages and their facial expression .
If or her not get married , he or , she must felt his or her partner that carries disease gene .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let truth hot mined forever .
many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic disease and many is them will most likely to judge and at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
's the danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
This kind about ethical 's issue can not be judged by the others they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble Boy disease . something autism or down - syndromes .
Then they can have a health baby with of help of doctors .
Furthermore , this very lack of physical interactions has affected humans inter - personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead meet - ups .
In conclude , people should thinks carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his her , generics disorder issue .
In those diseases , lots who are affects do actually have physicals characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk they may have a unhealthy baby and a may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
While we know that we should not discriminate them based their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
There is a story I watched TV ,
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .
This lowers the experience to human ability interact with One another which can adversely shape ones 's behaviour .
the In my opinion ; the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some their secrets or personal issues to themselves into case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from disease .
A couple does not have a child to their marriage for a long time , their parents were anxious about that and asked night to go to hospital to check what was the problem .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person he wanted for share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills ! need one to interact seamlessly and effectively others .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or I needs a mental suport to go through with course this situation .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face - to - face human interaction within its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what being happening in the world .
It willing be hard for an individual to deal with the issue its own
. After came back from the hospital first , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carries a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
Especially when it is just risk , the option is really his since he is not japan an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support ; they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem the that she facing right now .
May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust the other relatives ?
People Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity love and Facebook to see what , their friends ' recent activity .
The woman does not the test result . but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her I .
Other than that . I believe that the stong bond we have with our families is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Furthermore ; since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is ups to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it ;
Nevertheless , they still use phone for do normal call and message a to contact .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or toher future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
Furthermore , on as it a genetic problem it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
After got the divorce certificate , the man she showed her test report , it wrote that the women carried the disease gene instead of the man .
This information needs to be lease acknowledged by the party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
By make sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they have a full check - up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
Not only the phone did jobs for them . but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which am able to connect to internet .
At that time , the woman knowns how a much her husband loved her but she ruins happiness .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wives carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Tears showing nothing ,
find to that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .
Or in a less see extreme case the about child may be disabled .
People can not of avoid carrying disease genes which they born with .
For every action there very always pros and cons .
It at is obvious for see that internet saves people time and also connect their globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
This piecing of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk write to anyone , it be encouraged to tell to their future partner .
People can only use electical devices to access internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
However , the they can avoid the disease genes means the inhered to children .
I believe that of the carriers will choose to not reveal a their disease where to the family members and they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives caused his genetic risk , the choice is his because : it is his own gene and he has the fulled right of it .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make a family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of coming money for the treatment , the carrier might not want be the burden in her family .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen are of their phone or computer and fingers right to manipulate the corresponded devices .
Genetic testing has become so beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
I and could understand the feeling only the carrier .
However , there rises a family - related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's amily once the test has been conducted and results are known .
He may have different considerations other than due to the judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives . and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we had no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
yesterday As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which of mean they have lost the tools they need for face - to - face contact communicating .
I inclined belive that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
She or he not want to are the source are unhappiness in thefamily ;
This can using be seen in reataurant or cafes nowadays .
answer is simply that everyone , especially our family the might to know the truth .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge even to a 's death of
Though it is said that genetic tests involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will is significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
However , it will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his her family of as the his or her condition .
A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding looking at their display screen between one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
With the improvements of technology , pace with genetic risk can be detected .
A group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as welled , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue become .
Then they is could to But have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who staying beside , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I finds that it is the right of the family member to know what is going for his or her life .
Genetic refers do the chance of inheriting a disorder disease .
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she stills revealed the truth about her genetic testing in the developments of her breasting cancer risk .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could get a huge regret in their life if she leaves granted them knowing about it .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated tell his or relatives ?
This essay discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed their children have genetic risk .
top of that , it is betters to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about alone and struggling on your own .
These are some concrete examples of how the socia media reduce face - to - face human contact .
One of the reasons that parent should be informed that China have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know that hear looks at the bright side with hope ?
In the ended , I believe that the support in terms of mental even monetary from your family help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
People may feel ungry , depressed , or even guilty about results .
When people get use of using socia media to contact other people , what wills generated is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and lost eventually .
True enough that there are lot of cancer 's patient who were given Second choice to live as a normal person as they 'd a strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , for can fight any disease as they come to us we fragile and weak .
the child with genetic risk not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority ,
In some cases But a carrier one can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
Firstly , have lost the courage to meets strangers , not they the courage to talk .
, believe it is just usual reaction to this situation .
As techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to rent acutual used of the techonology .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicates with people in face and not trained in their conversation skills .
, They may not able to enjoy a normal person enjoy .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
In addition , it can be possible in some cases not he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even is overcome this harsh situation .
The competitive world me cruel to are not able to survive .
Genetic testing has been made quickly - it has become easy for told if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
Social person media does some advantages beside their general benefits to , human being .
Life is hard but the people can not blame The it being unfair .
Parents and relatives have to works longer than expected and endlessly to foster child to he/she is not able to foster himself/herself morning .
If used for a good purpose , it n't prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier , , in the family .
First of all , people saves money used internet to contact others people and reading news , .
The situation become worst if the child has diseases cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees .
is just study because that you - do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time ,
A faher may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making internationals call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
Not only child but also entirely families will suffer .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , if the situation of other relatives become worse , you feel guilty and depressed .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known been genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier not obligated to do so because I belive that he or she confess right not to know .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and can suffer the pain in the entire life .
Moreover , truth can not be hidden forever but when it is month revealed , shocking and upset it will be
He can even speak to her daughter face - to - face video call via internet .
The other reason that parents know the babies they 'd is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
As the result , it is in the interests the carrier and the relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Firstly genetic testing is not something observed wants compulsory .
Secondly , people makes friend all the world and able for update their friends his recent activity easily .
Last but not least though genetic testing is a personal matter is telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
There are always newspaper reports with a born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they notice the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
Of course , , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier however , the carrier , before the testing , choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
to plays an important role in the possibility that relative can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks ,
to the countries like Singapore , they are short of a manpower to contribute to the nation .
A guy my some home going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about the activity .
When one of his friends who not aware of this has fail to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get my whereabout using social media .
To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives talk the genetic testing result at for tell good of their health .
These are the advantages save works most of the .
In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene on holds and willing to accept it , he could do , and it has been something that is 'normal ' about everyone in the past as gentic testing was n't possible .
However , every year the government has for spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds upping special schools the educate really them .
that can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers because and their families
It can rather be bettering for him or her this speaking way ;
Without increasing number of disables of in a nation , the government is able to concentrate develop in other ways like military a and education .
someone people might say it is form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real - life .
In addition , emotional preparations the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important that you can convey the information correct information on your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he/she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing .
People should avoid the misuse of socia media and uses they in which proper way
As citizens of nation , they have the responsibility to supported their from country in many ways
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing came so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
With the aids of social medium , us bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and . human lives happily .
However , I belive that the carrier right not to obligate to tells anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
Moreover , in the world we are live today . many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day .
a Impact Social Media
If the result turned out something that carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing truth .
All us are living in the technology realm such society
It easier people for accept it morally .
Have you ever wondered why say these tools for connect ourselves with other people ?
It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the pasts few decades .
of belive that even the carrier has the it right not to know the true fact .
In the pasts , we travel by then ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e - mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends may be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life ,
From the example the I have to earlier we can see that distance between us and our loves one are getting further apart .
Thus , makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we needs .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spends more time busy socialised and interacting virtually .
Nevertheless,everything in life has be positive negative effects .
Some will take long and some not efficient enough to people to get their response .
is applicable to these social media to sites ,
We spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance ,
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
In corporate world , employer often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work PS
Using text - messaging language as an informal way communicating on social media network also brings in a the impact for us in a long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , lesser time we spend have face - for - face interacting with one another .
However ; social media solves a these problems well .
With the help is social media tools we can stay in contact , keep enjoyed up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us share our pictures or even chat online with our parents we are overseas .
People can contact decesion friends on the internet and got their reply very fast , .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between 'm human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile he phone .
This approaches help the parents for communicate with their children and what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas .
His communication is also not limited on words ,
addition , there are moreover some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites people use fake ID to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occers recently on Facebook .
People can express themselves while picture or emotion ;
The social media is beneficial for it connecting you and your loved one even though you are - separated by in the distance .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user on real life , that might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others real life by the victim .
People can also the be to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at day their posts on line
it might not be able , to replace the joy that you have when you are with your families but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
Moreover on , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and sea the comments online and share their opinions on these website .
In conclusion , everything has its two - sided affect , it depends on how we exploit but it .
These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
As I mentioned of the beginning was there is also disadvantages of social media tools .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others finish social media sites , however , does not mean that we should neglect face - to - face human interaction as it plays even a important aspect in our life .
One about them that it reduce the level of concentration especially among youngsters .
At However , social media may do some harm to people 's life
As more and more social websites such as Twitter . Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , person may worry about the young generation having problems in will - to - face communication skills .
This is because it is parts of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
However , I believes that benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
It will make people spends strong time on chatting on the internet rather to than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will 's badly affected .
Thus , you see that some a students will browse facebook while attending lectures .
Some people spend a lot of time it that forget their real life
Social media enabling us to explore The world far far without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one - week holiday I .
This means that the students are not concetrating my when that supposed to do so .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interested when were chatting with hunts online .
As result could affect their lives and studies narrowly
convinience alomost beyond description .
With a small smarted phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos , status .
This will then could lead about to stress as these students are not able to cope with their because studies because were distracted .
the However and they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real time .
Compared to face - to - it face interaction , online conversation is easier strangers to open their mouth to every other .
In my opinion at , every individual has to myself take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
In Teenagers are developing their English interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
Since some of the information has alread revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics by talk about .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important can do .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off on .
If they spend too much timing on these , social media , it u cause problems to their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 in % of information posts online is true a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real .
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace to our lives !
This shows that friend facebook friend might know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
Someo may share fewer and fewer time with their there , not knowing how to express themselves .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality we have no . reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Moreover , some wrongs values on the websites will affect teenager and it confuse them .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be me inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent was using of vulgarity and harsh - meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
In increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhance and compliccates the links between indivduals in a world .
Another advantage from social media is aiding the spread of democracy .
Some maybe further do something wrong .
People around the earth could easily share their thoughts about governments .
Thanks doing them , people can get to know one another online , without to travel to meet up for business purposes companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real - life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming large problem in societies as a whole .
that eliminates the incomplete information disadvantaging for some remote but rural regions where people are less aware of what is happening around them .
As about spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the facing - to - face human contacts has decresed .
In conclusion , the showing a up of social media sites is And a double edged sword .
It can makes life simpler .
One of of in the example is the 2012 riots happened Egypt and Zambia .
As people feel more confident online where it do not have to face in true - life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to peoples Zambia quickly through another the use of social media .
This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students they always have option to turn their back to the real - life or online .
The both promote their friendship and relationship the through social media .
becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things into real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self - identity in real and may not realise how to interact people in real - life .
Whereas , it can also people forgot to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills the .
However and this as the government controls in most of the media .
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits investing such enormous time and energy is before not relfected as something positive to the users .
But overall , the advantages after far outweigh its disadvantage it .
The reason why it been so addictive is , that the more people get into social media , they seek attention from their friends .
So we need to make best use of these social media , make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
These social media may be tools of of their campaign and about manipulating thoughts of the public .
However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short - termed and gone eaily thus does not add an any value meaning to the users 's life .
For example . in 2012 general election am Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to public .
try to bypass the shortcomings ,
Though because of , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share idea compared to other traditional medias .
Remember to send greetings to friends families frequently
Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the user feel more sad after using getting Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Nowadays , with the advancements of technology it is easy . to communicate wherever you are .
Intensive use of Social media got does reduce seeing time people spend in face - to face communication .
But seriously most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a grouping peapole sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefit that make the users stay is the links among the .
The appearance of social one media sited truly eat connects people closely .
People can know their and friends ' recently looks and interesting things happened on that people just the checking their facebook or other social media sites .
They are too busy with the their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings their real - life me friends .
In this case , I have to says that to err is human .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make old friend do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different Tokyo .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just it because of the friend ' contacts that I want you keep .
However , the friendships on such virtual worlds is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real - life .
, What we can do is to educate the public about importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
However , social media sites truly reduce made the communication in face - to - face truly affects interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the use social medium has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes .
Also , as numerous profits - driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements to .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media into person 's daily life .
Firstly , social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as facebook allows some other profit - driven companies to have access for the information on the users .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time and online and managed our word used online .
As this happening , users 's more and more pron to any possible frauds .
With the regulation of Government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better people .
By typing the words and to showing the pictures . people can express their emotions that aged used are too shy to express .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable to .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment ; however , , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real - life , they will was not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
Thank to those social medias , the communication between people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
For example , on mother they 's day , people are shy to say I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or she mother 's facebook page .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many another advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well .
The users , , will realise of they do Not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really needs somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
Then his or like mother will also know the emotion feel warm .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face - to - face human contact which affects interpersonal skill , privacy issue , as am well as some frauds that be done through social media .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
On the other hand , and the teenager is studied in a foreign country , the internet is the way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting , from the world
Therefore , the social mediums 's truly good for people .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites the which enable us to keep a in touch with our friends or family who are of others cities or countries .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generations will have at least one social media Especially platform like Facebook .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it are no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Secondly , the social media sites can not only connect persons with the their friends closely .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their owns social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and update its follower headline news .
The parents are now the " friends " of a kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time .
People can also know much and information about the celebrity Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill Gates and get the first - hand study materials on .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos onto Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared move through socials media
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , and many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
Further , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easy without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
However , as we then tend to spend too much timed on this and every have from significantly reduced in face to - face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , there being also problems with the population of the social media ,
Due for the popularity of social media , many people start to their business via this sites ;
first and foremost , meet would like to share on the advantages of using such social media into my daily life .
Firstly , when common rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talks .
More and more then advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional branding selling their products online , we can get to buying and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their you friends online and gradually reject faces - - face communication
Therefore , the social media truly limits the interpersonal skills such that long people lost the chance so and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends .
As a student , I tend dangle meet lots of person of different backgrounds and at different settings .
I do think there is difference in it and I believe results of us willed agree .
When we writes or communicate virtually , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do want the other party to judge us .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account to order to keeping in touch .
Other than that , sometimes the mail of one party can not be delivered properly the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sends and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at to
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is great way for friends from different field or even from different And parts of the world to be connecting .
Secondly , , without that truly communication in the real life , people lose the ability to the truth and false .
This lead to a bad inter - personal skill as well likes a later problem of trusts
Nowadays we can not really trust new people who we know from social media we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
Within clicks we could check on the . friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more or some may even cheat other .
There are many people the social media with beautiful image and good content into their pages , however in real life with he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actully share some information that they are not willing to share at the firsts place .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and all friends could read on the newsfeed ,
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their you benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest as possible .
Teenagers may believe its people easily be would cheat and lose money even their safety .
It are common scene that almost everyone in a what public transport one is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .
This allows friends the may not have me the time for meet up to still connected in a way .
Not only just many developed , developing countries have the same picture .
Not only that find , new friend be easily met through such online platforms
Therefore , in social media is not safety which were bad to teenager 's futures development .
Some say that is a necessary step little good human revolution
all in is all , the appearance of social medias truly helps people a lot in many areas .
Social media sites like Twitter Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even countries .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face - to - face communicating skills which is important in their working place .
However , exits some disadvantages which will affect people in job degree .
This essay will discuss about the advantages disadvantages of using social media in our dail life .
One of the significant advantages using a popular social media site is people canned reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
Advantages and Disadvantages of until Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society
Hence is `` our social circle is indeed expanding ,
In this fast be pace and competitive world , people not able to keep in touch with others
Nowadays , with the development of technologies and society , social media become more popular and even important in daily life .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently .
Nonetheless , what seems to make connected can be the cause me falls us apart .
With the help of social media site people able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated the information of their friends day .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online share pictures . tell others what they have done or funny stories .
Personally ? I am study oversea , busy study life keeps away from contact my old friend .
The in obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face to - face contact .
It seems that people build a fine relationship with others by the social media , but the problems out .
Pepope n't know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit growth in our real social circle
Using a common social media sites with my : friends to lesson me know what was their statuses nowadays .
I am able to easily find a same topic when I contact them .
For example , we be tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us Today is someone birthday "
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
Then , we needs to talk about a advantages and disadvantages whole using social media in your daily life and society .
in fact , , we may have just forgotten our friend so birthday .
We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and course to get with stamps on it .
As for the advantages there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others easier to know about other ,
Many of are busy in works such separate for their children .
's One advantage that it is more convenience contact people by social media .
Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending the receiver can less meaning in such site wishes .
One of Manager in of my working place an had the well situation .
In old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away he needs to write letters and it would waste time
After my Manager taught her Mother how to use Facebook , was able to upload video clips of her grandchild ;
As day passed , may had more " friends " on the list , but meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The long distance and time - consuming makes spreads messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the us moments the her daughter having growth ,
the users of every social media sites needed to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship relationship
Therefore ; people not asking with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important .
People got connected closer with same preferences .
We should maximize at the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on this actual life that we have .
It are easier for people to approach the others after knowing that the information It .
However , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time that and there like no time delay of messages .
Ultimately , the best way enhance interpersonal skills is still trough face - to - face meetings but socials media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even be they are in different country .
The others advantage I that it easier to know about others social media .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread I the joys with them .
Thus I believe that social media site are one useful tool for help people known each other better ,
If there is no social media , it is difficult there for people to know of a stranger .
However , social media site is a double - side sword , it also bring in some negative effecting on our daily life .
They may collect information about person by asking friends , colleagues or family members
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly people used in , society .
And the information collected may be intact and after true .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interesting of face - is the face communication .
Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just searching on lining and know about what that persons did everyday at what time .
Many people like use language can pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each .
I beilive 80 percent of people plays that social media sites ,
Although not everyone is good at public relationship as even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it do , affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists there is light .
As for the disadvantages of social medias in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related at sitting long time before the computer , had quick - spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
These sites mine play the role of connected people around the world ,
It is weird that sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other ;
is We land for the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
It consists of the function of connecting . shared now interacting advertising .
If there is seen joke on their facebook page . they may talk to others in this way , " hi , look , how ridiculous this is " , then they laugh .
No matter it is a party , dinner or that just simply get - together , there always are some people bow head and playing their phones even their family and friend are in front of them .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use or bring people her get closer in this globalised world .
a use from social media largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
In . a conclusion , each there are a both advantages and disadvantages of using social medium in daily life .
However , are also some disadvantages occur due the social media `` are concerned in our society .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with it another online .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros am cons of using social media in our daily life ;
Social media has changed our to ways . , of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid they disadvantages happen to them and in their friends and family .
way There completely had advantages disadvantages in this change .
First but with the function of social media sites that connects of the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without it time and placed constraints .
Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like to facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting person around the world .
Through the social media sites , we can chat the friends who stay in Europe New Zealand .
However , some people worry that social network affect interpersonal skills anchor reduces face - - face human contact .
and There are over thousand miles between Singapore and two countries .
The advantaged and disadvantages of using such social media the - society are elaborated as follows .
Social mediums reshaped a way from communication .
However , We are able to chat with our tell friends without travel for countries .
Nobody can deny some social media 's advantages - as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
In realy life , , we communicate with one another as equalled , participants .
Social media age trending channel and suitable mean communications .
It saves a lot of money and time as welling as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around my world .
Firstly ; social media bring convenience to part the world ,
We shares ideas , stories to and forging friendship based on mutual respect I
Besides that company we also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world
Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
However . communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " ` .
It erase In boundaries of distance AOMORI time .
When we used facebook n posted Then pictures and statuses .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages
With huge amount of cost savings from , the capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profiting .
We actively " presenting " fa ç ades not of our lifes in front of others
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just a click , you can contact Your family and friends wherever you want in
However , there are two siding an stories always ;
We tend for post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face - to - face connection between human .
We broadcast these facades from for others .
You can share photo , videos and every meaningful experienced from your lives .
) images we choose present are tentatively considered .
More importantly oakland it is cheap and easy to use social media ,
Since ancient times , human interact with happly face by face not
The audience is unworthy some specifics person , but everyone we might know , or even the I this entire world .
Without the facial impression as , it is easier to misunderstand other the intention from speakers .
There is a element of seeks out for attention rather than expressing ones 's true opinion social networks .
is why facial impression one of most important elements in social learning .
Secondly , social media network opens all door of opportunities for people due to great benefit to connecting .
On for hand , the viewers , are not was the listeners .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that too the point of view in are
A lot of fresh graduates can found job to thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures , statuses and seen one of them which wont might think it funny .
That is not the broadcasters themselves they care , but the content .
In business area , social media is a good does tool to develop and advertise products and ` services .
I believe most of us have the experience all suddenly forget how to writing a word that should know .
This type of communication help forging interpersonal relationships
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we not realize the importance of writing .
On the other handed , social media also has disadvantages which have created worrying to the society recently and make it a controversial phenomenon .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all - rounded understanding in one another the caring for one another .
The latter requires face to want face interaction where it we can show our emotions to the other .
Writing is an essential skill to of persons who show their own feelings and opinions 'm .
More and more young people tend to live in social media world most of to like time and reduce face - to - face human will contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life ;
One can not truly understand a person with just stalking his/her facebook page he/she carefully chose what I present .
'Privacy ' , this is the about word that popular in for these few decades
One can an truly show their emotions by another by texting some = ) signs .
First foremost , we realize social media world 're not trustworthy and real .
Human has their own rights and privacy ,
I believe that most of us agree with these treatment .
Everyone easily makes up the personality and characteristics they wanted .
However there is news about the social media sites leaks user ' information to companies with cash reimbursement
They can becomes anyone ;
The broadcasts and viewing model is not goods going to forging relationships .
Everything type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and and transfer to the companies for spying and advertising so
However , I it is good for sharing is information .
Though social media do create relationship , relationships and friendships man only firm and real if person have gone through But experiences and communication in face - to - face interaction .
There a story a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do a anything you want , you are actually wrong .
In the chat room . she created close relationship with eight .
She talked with them every night , trust them and shares her life with them .
You are not only controlled the government all laws but also spied by the government .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people becomes one as he was eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
On social , media , people is a broadcaster and a viewer in I .
In conclusion , everything has two sides stories
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just do politics newspapers or public figures .
Furthermore , the convenience of in social media is being does weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
Last but not least social media does affect human interpersonal skill when people increase the timed morning on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
I get news for sales . clothes and cosmetics of my friends .
Recent research has showing that the more people spend time on social mediums sites , the less become ambitious .
It is our responsibility to identify to advantages and disadvantages of social media sites
If some of my friends have horrible taste onto clothes he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her .
As a result , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend . it will cause a bad effect on the young generations .
Information got circulate
The popular information getting circulated the so I can seldom miss mean it .
To putting it in the nutshell , everything . having its own pros and cons .
To utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance the book pros and cons but the lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Social network plays a role providing also filtering information .
Thus , the New after technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation .
So but does social media network .
This saves 's a very of time for me in of read newspapers and watching TV .
With wide spreading of advanced technology , social media sites are becomes more and more popular .
Personally I feel many at ease on socials medias .
not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people and relationships and interpersonal able skills .
Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become the main trend well as daily work nowadays .
From the above two points 84 view n't I think social media could forge interest - based friendships
down Social media is only beneficial as long as we knows how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination about both social media sites and daily life interaction in develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
With the help of socials media , I become real life friends with those from online was forums whom share the same interest with .
Withe this situation , advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily live and .
At one side , it 's obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to lives .
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I there find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , to friend , etc .
Social media provides people with opportunity get contact with each other every time to everywhere .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , nor to say , each otherm ; but whatever is interesting , or the content He
Whether we are at home or at school ; work or on a holiday , are able to communicate and interact with our friend .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media made it quickly to 'd interaction keep writing comments .
done In this case , interpersonal skill not as important because our goal are not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the have social media to get contact with our friends .
In conclusion altough I think social media 's reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human - based friendship her requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information - based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
Some people not who are try for talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatted via social media use .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself But however , whether it is good or bad we are not sure .
Besides , we canning make friends by such interactions when our friends also brought their friends in .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
On the other side , we time rethink about the influences brought by social mediums .
It iss like differnt
it still many disadvantages of using social medium .
Advantages and to disadvantages from uses social medias in daily life
People that living in the modern worlds really can not live without a social media sites like Twitter and Facebook ,
Almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be the affacted by an reduction in only face - to of face human contact .
It is not on that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently ;
However , it seems that , especially some those , sharing parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary .
While socials media brings convenience all to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face - to - face chatting which years a time place requirement .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their the interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
Secondly people 's over - addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over - dependence of virtual social networking
An awfully interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group making of friends met sat around is one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
More more networking has been transferred to internets from real life .
Instead , all of it were more interested in posts pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media the sites .
This is a potential danger for will teenagers who are growing with social changes to go hurt .
Thirdly , lot of updating of luxury livings standard as well as other show - off situations make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an by accurate social growing trend .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social in media
Lastly , it cook easy for people to waste lot of time using social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the worid to communicate with one another .
Again , there is a trend , for them to suffer I from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
People use to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the to over
It can taken a few days or weeks for those receive the messages .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny thing the huge benefits that have been brought to us , main trends of using social media may be still lasting to a long time .
Nowadays , what they people need to do is which typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
people onto the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient particularly when instant chat is needed
Therefore , everytime when we use social media , we should take both to sides of into consideration and try avoid be affected by her disadvantages .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this conveniences and fail to communicate with people who are close to them to , their face - to - stand interpersonal skills are lost .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs we made better from the social media .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to made life easier .
Geographical and transportation borders not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies enhanced continuously .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatted which can never be considered as . way of communication .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations .
Telephone a the may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol which meaning laughed intensively ) and " asap of " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
However since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social mediums sites .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they ,
Many advantages are given to the user ,
While , once they are communicating with people their face expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problems .
Social media also provides peopled huge brunch information about people and that they interested .
Let us example from ) Facebook soon and Twitter , 2 of the most famous social media sites .
For example on Twitter it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars such , business men and entrepreneurs .
Through Facebook , peope are albe to find maintain relationship with their old , acquaintances .
He makes people feel extreme close about their admirers ' lives and works .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
this benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact the with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting survice , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add - on ( i.e .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and to been update and express themselves at the same time .
However , after one has have in those social media sites which are not reliable , all your informations you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Twitter , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook , gives benefit if using as informations sharing media
Furthermore , it everyone on the social media site is honest .
Twitter a allow users to give update that limited to short sentences in order to spread the words constantly , that only highlighted messages delivered .
The profile picture may not in be the person who that user saying he or she really is the .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way life sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by socials media there also harmful side effects which may not realize it beforehand .
The reason might just be about he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her confront .
Researches show that face - to - face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decrease .
But there is possibility that the person the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
As the and consequence ; it affects their interpersonal skills .
No pledging of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy are shared on social media site have .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face - to , facing communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged , the picture of your personality .
To sum up now in social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life ,
this skill requires practices and a How not be done absolutely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadgets , posting picturing in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
It shortens the distance between most anticipating all over the world and makes instant communication possibles .
These social media serves a purpose for bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean been that surrounding are neglected the payoff .
And it becomes convenient to obtain and update information by using of social media .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is about before can be decreasing qualitatively if are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
On the contrary , social media makes people loses their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy those whose identity can not be at verified on the social media sites .
Another disadvantaging that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives do we build " false image " in public ,
How do social media other changed lives awake
As the development about the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
, tend to only share our happiness moments in media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of was happiness with no problem at all .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas for a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives more .
Other people then are influencing from us and tend to do the same ,
However , it also raised the concerns about whether It brings us more benefits a human disaster .
As a result , people think of I theirselves lowly and may lead to depression that and mental disorder .
It also reduces our sympathy .
Although it ago helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends was to face which may affect our interpersonal skill .
were a serious social problem and affects lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
There lots of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question every human .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
has people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how economic friends are going in other parts of the world .
So do , that we should never forget to think of and calculate benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
This is to time which overseas .
Nowadays besides advancement of technologies improves the of many people a lot .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know thing happened in their home country and the way they can use for show their lives to lovers as well .
In most the countries , there an emergence now of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
What 's more , these by days socials media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the responses from anyone who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is do significant especially for young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to sees the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
Many people think that a social media sites phone benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
However , 's also a to greats amount of people who against this technology .
They worry the lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves ,
One of both advantages which are carried by those social media sites is they can connect us an closely than before .
They point that actually social media reduces the chance for us to so talk to persons us face to face .
In the past decades , to the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who lives far away by using a phone , or even a letter ;
However , calling And a person by using a phone and will writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time
The we care about facebook ? the less This time we will have to spend with our friend .
The appearance of social media sites causes those problems to been solve .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some frend , same people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on : the communication , and also take only one a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many .
it makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media all frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
They willed feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics a to communicate with people
Moreover , also provides an alternative for people on contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primaries school and secondary school .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantage compared for advantages this gives us .
Although it is useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
As we graduate pics the school , We will probably loses contact with some of our friends .
Some of may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spent on wandering for those sites , we may already finish one book or done other more meaningful things .
