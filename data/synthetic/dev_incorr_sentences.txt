good Morning ?
This is an esay about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and that is more I movie can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me furthermore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't wait anybody .
, 's really nice for your expressly E - mail yesterday .
I said because when I was eleven my best friends had been operated on her back and almost before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais , I hated that !
It 's difficult answer at the question " what 's you going more to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to knows it is in two minds .
You regret that you were n't there with me . 'll try dicribe everything precisely , becouse but I know that you us very
Luckily learn the operation was fine and she left to many come with me , and since that though I go for my own .
Swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it the is amusing too .
Dear Paul
When to was younger I so used month to say that that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would opened my own psychology office and help people .
Learning a country 's culture , especial classic culture , the first is learn its reality .
have seen your notice in the academy newspapers and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I would recommending people who not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to hard and a lot but I think that you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Because of we are Chinese , why will do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owne culture through a foreing language ?
I was bears in the UK for I can be a very good teacher no of English .
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It was small but comfortable and famous for his big burguers .
I the thought that dance is a styles for self - expression .
Maybe I 'll change my minding maybe n't ,
Although I comes to Spain ten years later so I can speak with in Spanish it was necessary .
I think that the public transport will always be into future
Woolypools was speciallist of meal at , it am a meal restaurant .
It 's the not just a hobby , it more than this
In my opinions the restaurant can be better , respect to meats , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
The rich people will buy a has but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
Also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 but years when to young .
Dance is a time passion , a type of life .
I have expects to be more famous better and biggest
I consider is more convenient n't drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the rhthym in my body !
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , excepting my stupids So companions that they do n't understand anything a .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask for you something to be friends and change your telephone number
But is another theme speaks .
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do in the very other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people ! cities , , , space , that be very small for lots of people .
To my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use also bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In this life we have things that make us happy and make our lives go on
has All members congratulated me another as well .
When you dance , sing . or act you are showing something to the public . something that am for important por you .
On the other hand , I had taken care my brothers and I cousins for many hours when they were very young .
example it , a present or a gift especially if it from your bested friend .
If dance is your passion ; you practises life day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until yo can .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of the public one .
Once , . I the sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
You be must know was that I 'm very responsible kind and funny person .
If you are sleepy does n't matters ; because you like you 're doing in .
You 'll wake up the early to going dance , or do dance classes .
It was my favorite see flower I , it ever .
That makes me a good candidates to achieve the go job , or the hobbies for me
In India care have various types of Public transport in like Cycle , Bike , Car of Train & Flight .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be in attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
Depending on distance and duration to the desired place , modes of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transported ,
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film star deserve to have a private life without journalists following them the time .
You do n't matter if you go if sleep late , and do n't sleep the ...
I hoping you By keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to number disappoint you
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , No happy .
reminds me of one trip that I have recently been to and the places is Agra
He 's a joke , it must sleep ,
In adition all pearsons have the right to privacy and for are free . .
you love dance , you 'll , understand me
Best wishes time Julia lived
It takes around 6 hour by National highway is go of Delhi to Agra .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the timed , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
Members for my families .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame , because if they do take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
We have stopped at hotels for having foods and just in se any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered the though shortage in demand .
Because not everyone affords buy their own car
i love my family special my little sister , she has sixteen years olds is i consider best friend because i using to tell her everything of my life .
So that ; politicians and film stars could have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they the then have the reward what they earn .
Since , we have the option , wait anytime we wanting to when we travel by car ( that is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .
Besides there the are lots of low income people who n't buy their owns cars .
i have dog it name chente , it is a golden retriver .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
It 's a lover dog , he knows how i feel .
This is are .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the for back seat and wake recently up fresh .
What the the " Family " meaning .
oldest sister her name cinthya ; she is really Especially weird with me .
our relation is not good she is so different to me .
well morrining
In my opinion , Family is the place that you best friend can help each other and know each
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I going conclude that travelling by car is much convenient .
Also i have a brother names is jose luis he twenty years old , his personality is dinamic and funny .
How being u ,
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of parent when they get old , but the point is what you can not survival , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you parent .

Then it can sell them get income of .
A busy life always compell for use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind of motor cars .
In my opinion I think that public transported in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that n't have enough money to pay for a car even if that is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use the cars then bus or underground .
So they plan for display myself all ...

What we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n't had other with him the one who create our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree But the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it has will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we cans listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or much family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't needed necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
I am some interested in this work because I enjoy travelling and I am teacher so words I like working with the children .
Transportation the heart of any city whether that is public or private .
I am sure that I will look after children very well .
In that moment and ants and Penny attack them in their backs . making them to leave the place to .

When she said that , Michael started to cry and mad saying that said was lies and do n't heart .
Recently I saw thriller of mokingjay part a 2 .
Sandra Barrientos
With the sweeping progress of development and the was booming of population , of many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had being used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
If you want to see that cinema , you need to watch first 3 movie before to understand it .
He getting so mad , that he asked her to get out of apartment .
the tecnology have chanched the people 's life very much.in fact we think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our the grandparents life.for example my parents did n't whacth on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alone difference : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
following day ; she said sorry and them was happy again .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will with many drawbacks to the environment or even human very animal .
first movies , , were an amazing ! !
Although the fact in that personal vehicle like car now is popular , into the future , the stance of public transport is still write crucial ;
Nowaday , people use fossil fuel as the most unimportant source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
To start by with ; there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
But when them get the home of Michael They fight again and Michael had get a knife and kill her most
lot of action , so drama and the these romance .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are packed with places residence , commerce and recreation the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
As a result , actually governments will invest much in researching the usage of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
Additionally , people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species .
He by crying with a lot blood around
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with the problem.first of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
The fans of this series , had is wanting as this movie science the the the first movie appeared , that was 2012 .
I do n't think that this movies is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , opinion I think is more a teen movie .
The range of public services will . be expanded to remote areas & it become more convenient .
Michael get from there ,
Sustainadle my development should that be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is based in the book , the theme is unique and original , also the actors the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the prior choice ,
To sum up , this unpleasant phenmenon , and problems should be worked to resolve before thing get worse ang the governments have to taking the responsibility for that .
Michael closed the door knew at that moment he had made a mistake and
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in world will become overcrowded , It wills lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air a pollution .
Hope me guys choose movies ! !
Nowadays languages are very important , and more English .
In some perespectives , these problems are led by the - using of personal vehicle .
It willed been very cool to see , the las part mokingjay !
Public transportation is an important invention into human history . it brings amount of benefits in our lives .
is not my first me that I study .
People will realise using their own car is just about waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so welled since I decided to go to London course to learn this language .
For instance we take subway order to seems avoid stocking in traffic .
feelings my favourite out sports is Karate .
So the best to them to travel is public transpotations
I have taken that decisions because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not a have the level that I want , so when I heard about that ooportunity I said yes .
It true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it 'd cause more damage to our I life and harm our environment .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however the public transport is better to friends a journey .
First of all , I enjoy it when I practise I families feel I can holding on for hours .
Each person for should practice saving when any source of eneny to protect his own live )
It can carries many without problems
Therefore , needed to think more about our future , offsprings it .
When I 've has a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind for sport that is n't very hard .
Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like buses , train , subway , tram etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied a person , when the car is . prepared for to carry four or five people .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable replaced to live was .
If there is public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
Training Karate is a way to forget problems to forget your tiring routine .
In conclusion , investments on developing for public transport will can increased considerably public services of travelling has a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaceble
who this situation to create many pollution to environment so we have more conscience for planet health
In my opinion it 's very difficult fnd this advantage with others his sport .
In my country , taipei , we a always stock in traffic about one hour in the to morning ,
I want to say something the learning of the Languaje , is hard to got to me of for the next reasons :
Hello Alex , are and you by
Apart from that ; Karate it 's not am just a sport , is also a discipline ; it teach you respecting , balance even culture .
Are you free for weckend 'd you any plans
teacher show us how we have to behave in others and he teaches us a lot of things about the japanese culture
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teacher or institutes teach is like the Spanish Languaje and my native Languaje .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT but how sleep I willing take school .
Me and my friends go any to the cinema ; and invite you to go with us .
If you interesedt , find me 8 clock near cinemas entrance .
for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the , class , so my advice is just not for get nervous and to be concentrated on my or she is doing .
Car is convenient to human , but do last it bring damage for human also .
Technology . is something that is very important , something without which we canned not live .
Thank you Helen to him those wonderful presenting ;
That I want to you say , is very difficult to evaluate the conjuntion of of verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje .
I want to read these kinds of book .
For example carbon dioxide is created by car web
Today things are Technology as
I to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evenings went I to the beach .
Second reason . in in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb been written before the subject , but no , Which been the rule ?
it cause global warming which threats environments and harms daily life .
Nowadays we use tecnology in every thing , from educations to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it being very helpful , useful and important for developments but todays generation is influenced whit technology that have stopped to do activities .
In conclusion it is evident that because develops countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and stables environment for younger generation to it grow to .
we can see that there are at lots of city and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire mud slide .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
Is there anyone
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story to competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter all the competition .
The third reasoning :
The cause of Brain drain should be tackled at international and national level the a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
What others precautions is usually taken ?
love play cricket
but there was a fees in order join the competition , he had no money . fortunately it have a lot of friends can lent him .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in the positive manner .
The NG Office is notified by the photographers when the film shipped the
I am enthusiastic towards it game .
he phoned and asked me to a lent him some money to register part the competition ;
There nt feww oxygen in the top of Everest to breathe easily
When the film does n't arrive time , it . immediately
he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his stories to without the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
favourite teamed is India because I belongs to this country now
Jordan Romero has got 13 he climbed Everest May 2010 .
Lost shipments have been more easily when this process will be started right from
Mount Everest is so high that it is very difficult climbing ;
pleasure traveling
Travelling by car is n't . much more convenient unless it is so much the more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chair me .
people to go , .
the how top was now reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953 ,
In India and 85 percent our follow cricket .
the other hand , in future maybe would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n't has of to stand up .
My friends and I , we like a programs of of TV , electronic music fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
Every day - lots of to peopled are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to an international travel ?
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction the air in bit favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
Other transport public is the taxiing like car , it is so more comfortable too there is more expensive than bus or train .
Sometimes to are goes to the party 's in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
The AVE or aeroplanes are a option long trip .

But , evens when it 's true that it 's the by faster option , you must be very carefuly at time to off a plane .
It its Very good are .
Whenever play this a game , I always follow this person .
In conclusion , into an the future should have a bus so `` more comfortable .

Transportation one of the most important thing onto life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope . that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible

For our city it is really serious because when some new people visit Patras they see that things .
example there are girl she in my she is beautiful ,
Friends would communicated and exchanged / ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .

Patras of a very beautiful city and to for her culture , and for her monuments .
I can give you the advice on traveling and working in country
I love her I .
More importantly , parents . give person our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
Why to abaser thing
Her eyes faster as sun .
l wished you would have a impressed time .
But she is ignored me .
In case long , the families played important role in daily lives .
After we have today beautiful city we have to maintain her .
The weather is neither hots nor cold all years , you needed n't bring too many clothes because you can buy in here .
hope I can forget it .
The whole reasons are as follows
If you want travel this city . can be your guide as I have a year free before universities too .
This a modern city .
First of all , we canned learn lots of skill from parents according to their owned experience
People usually went here for shopping eating
Run to very your lived
My favourite sports is run ,
For example ? , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to made a meal from parents .
local foods very popular
In the my opinion in police should was stop Vandalisme .
you liked this
If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to done a graffiti and to write something or to draw .
I like to running fast so fast at fact it feel me as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch ground between the strides .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the morning things the which will cause trouble .
I also want to introduce my friends to you , we can have fun together .
I hope you will something that problem .
If difficulties telling to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this sistuation .
My favourite place to run is into the . forest I like to run sportive too .
when have played enough in the city , and you want find a job here
your Faithfully
I can recommed you to my uncle 's company to do a job .
I am likeing to felt the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths into the city of the streets .
All in all , into this case , the families are the very important friend in our lives .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .

Because it is difficult to get a job here if you is foreign and haven't finished colleges .
The Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the computers almost useless , getting better and making the who between old and new computer grow even so with every new discoverement .
The down around the world pupil are waiting for finished school .
may taking very long time to find a job and you have much times here .
As we notice , old and new computers are vastly different , started from the size of the computers , old computers were have much bigger than new computers .
They are eager to begin new home life as adults .
It my opinion . television can be educational . Whether you are watched a news or a show about World War One .
You may consider advices
Of course it were important to choose the right television shows .
My favorite sports is swims .
Old computers were uses to occupy one entire room , now , there only have the size of a box , even the size a book .
But when they reach in - period is confused feelings cross their minds
If you 're watching Tom Jerry , it hardly they have any educational value ,
It is because swum really fun .
You will have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place it visit ;
As a rule after exams for they do n't know what university to chosen
Also I think swim can keep our body fit and it can the people who swim feel cool when it is in a hot would day .
Although one could argue that you can always to ! learn something .
What they will do in future they saw , in a fogg .
Old computers only let you make math tasks was , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , an not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
my friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead some time now so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
The advices that I give near someone who want to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swim and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
In this I , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting that next education is very reasonable .
today I want misunderstanding write my job ;
One of the greatest achievements new computing hold is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc of . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) ;
I always these are the advice that gave to them .
Firstly it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period ;
Get rekt m8
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils n't notice it ;
'm a forensic biologist and I is deeply love my job .
Dear . - Camp director
My name is Eider and I am 21 years . I 's read your advertisement in the newspaper !
I went to the abandon house and started to think a best way to make his life miserable i passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
But , choosing the second education is very eat step which need serious attitude .
It to is a company with face lot of interesting aspects ,
Secondly such year off would give or to future students a chance to tries themselves in new professional sphears ,
As i did n't found nothing , i went to the place he live at and start to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him for the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they would be more united , so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , jus as he did with me !
And I am really my , sure I am the people that you are finding .
I am monitor in the free timed , and I am looking for a temporal job to improve my English .
But wait a minute am i really so angry this ?
It is dynamic , stimulating an , even if it is Not well remunerated , I felt myself satisfied .
Also they would have an opprtunity tomorrow being involved in volontier activity soon .
Neither I have problems for working in a kitchen , will be clear if I told study that my parents had a bar .
the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required analyze a sample , but what struck me most 's how fast this change happens .
's Yes ;
And thirdly they might work but earning own money travel
According to my age . evening activities were a problem for me , and I played many sports during my life , such as socker , bolleyball , ...
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind i did nt had no longer control over my actions , i was afarid of what i had become way i could do , but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
Television seeming not 's a controversial tool .
Waiting your answer ; Eider
Here there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience an educational way
year holiday will really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power which future education .
There city where I live is a little village .
One year is not long period .
But i so mad at him and so ansiouns to make the life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger , i had made a desition i was goingo to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him have been miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald
from my experience knowledge , I believe televisions cover both entertaining and educational functions .
But benefitted after year off myself will be obvious ,
I not agreeing with this idea completely /
All residents took great care of an environment .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children having horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different basics from a great so deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan , this is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and for my village they take different actions in the care of this .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Organized shares , wheres everyone clean ups the village .
On the one hand travel by car been really much more convenient friend as give the chance , in to you to be independent .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers
Apart from eduational contents , there are so many foul contents and business advertisements fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able ! to tell right from wrong .
People collects trash their house and await is trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside it village .
However , I believe educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
On hand huge traffic jams the big issue for travelling by car .
Thus help to protect our environment to make it clean , they safe , in order to not jeopardize our - various diseases .
Favourite sported
Also for , people go out to collecting the trash that there is on the kiosk , the church or in principal places on the village .
I think who the top restaurant we with can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
In my way village are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
Dear In Sir
Here we have typical Italian food .
There are spcejalne place where you can a organize high bonfires , but everyone has to clean up themselves and throw out all garbage .

language Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so be has future .
Wszysycy residents in my village , they of to , so that our village was clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in own car way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation.there are several reason to consider .
It would useful if I can live with other students , because 's is a sleeping good way to learning language as well .
I play football because I like but the only reason on that I do it hardly is that my dad .
Firstly , the bus is always drop by to get passenger that a more time expected to time of travel ;
Currently , most people is used to use their own cars to get to work or to go shooping , due to , it was more comfortable .
Secondly , public vehicle route are more far than usually route .
Lastly , Let me know if I need to pass any went level test my .
His dream is that I become the next captain of a big team and win a lot of monry part .
but cars polluting air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
I look forward to hearing from ;
Thirdly , it 's also crowded and no privacy .
So , if people were aware of this subjecting would n't use much their car .
Yours faithfully

Finally , there is strange chance to become a victim to theft and pocket picker ,
Peter at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately this , after listening conversations of his new neighbours than .
They are planning to rob a very precious thing from Museum tonight .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
First of all you need canned afford to buy there , after that you must pay for the asurance , council tax , and mechanic bills . and so on .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .

In , to I also admire the bullet train in , japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known .
It is his town and it is his duty too to to save towns 's histric .
i am interested in looking after chilren and with chilfen .
whereas in a public transport the you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus more train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is not your responsibility .
To sum it up and I still consider having their own car is way more safe mean convinient .
personality with childlike , I like children .
He called the police , inform about his neighbours robbery plan .
Besides , public Transport pollute less than almost cars ,
Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time I travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagrees with the decision of mineral extractions .
I had experience of holding basketballs competition when I the was student ,
3 Police reached Museum and caught robbers red handed Now
now In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use ` , the more future would have
More details and reasons wll be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my time opinion .
I am beleving that there is no future for the public transpot , using trains is mor convient and low expenses also to decrease the carpon gases which affecting the ozone , people should be aware about the effect of using the public transpotation on the econmics and enviroment , goverements shall encarge the people to use the other ways to transport , this subject shall that be issuesd in all media to learn and encrage the people to use he wrigth way for transpot .
I Planned , interesting activities for views to makes competition alive .
I 'm your employee , to serve on you company is .

I work for two months , pay a lot .
I always simle for people .
Just your wage paid too much lower than kinda , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I stayed about one nextweek in the home friend ,
I really went for get this jobs .
Next to go will 'll , extraction of an valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution .
a wedding ;
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
There has been an example that the other town polluted by the process developing the mineral .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , example bus , train , metros and more some for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
out I want to played with child and see their simle all day .
No ones can deny that pollution issue is of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
Travelling by ourselves is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel and also maintenance cost .
1 day , taste I visited Meandro del melero .
I smile is the bests gift this world .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good feedback by people .
Last but no the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence ; especially . to our offspring .
I olso a hard worker .
To take my friend , Taylor as an instance . her homeland were over - developed and become an arid place when she was a child .
I is beautiful come .
Instead the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way . because for the transport companies it 's n't convenient invest money , because fewer people would use it .
And there was a wonderful view .
, have passion for this job .
The other day , I walk a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with aunt Polly and she had to punishes Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
After she grows up , she decides to leave the and never to go back to her hometown .
If you think me is the right person you want please give me a responese Thanks .
The naming waterfall was Chorrituelo
On Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a ticking for tooth .
It spectacular
In addition , no blithe memory in her did childhood .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky so Tom talk to her at school and they is into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky
Tom say to her of another girl so she got mad and she ignored Tom .
in The wedding day , I a great time and I slept very late .
public transportation has been more used by people and over the years is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to it extent do we agree with And what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
One problem for that some people will consider the job opportunity that might bring to us ;
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we eat the restaurant with other people
Tom was so sad because Becky did n't to talk with him Tom went having in a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced person a lot of problems but they were able to solve by the end
Due of the mineral development ; many people in our hometown can probably earn much the money than before .
However , in any night , we had dinner in a garaje there was a party , all night ;
When Tom saw his house he sneak into his house and saw he aunt Polly crying for this .
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like maybe crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point . of view public transportation is very cheap and faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
It seems like a sought - the a chances .
to summaries it is different from oneis opinion to another i predict public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the all cars disappear and will will no longer be used
So the next day the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many thought that Tom was dead but suddenly Tom the open the door and got in so everybody was surprised to see Tom .
Nevertheless , they do n't give us any promises of the vacancy
You to should visit Las Hurdes not t is a beautiful site .
In additions , money is no crucial when came to health and environmental conservation .
The next day Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him have is that an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered like an andventure
In a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .
topic itself explaining this uncertainty of public transport in our country .
So they went to the misterious house and when they were inside they heard voices so Tom and Huck hide and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of there companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , scenarios ddrastically changed in past 10 years
the two boys heard that he was could planing for steal some money and kill people so boys start their adventure on stoping Injuin Joe ...
And there are A lot of things `
And the are very nice ;
Development of biodiesel industry could be contribution productivity growth
Therefore . I do It subscribe to this decision ;

As for one come questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotei " and " izakaya " ,
I do n't believe in it , especially while car are not flying
They much begun to study english at until an early age .
That is because you improves japanese skill in them .
Government should take immense action to stop it or in least make it slow down ,
Even if it will have happened there are people who ca n't get a car , because it is too exspensive , not only to buying but to fuel , service and so forth
After , many south East Asians has studied japanese in Japan while working in them .
They used at least would one hour to know english knowledge a day .
Buses are simple - you just How buy a ticket .
than By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have opportunity to get a job .
However the we the people have really important part of at making I worse .
Even kids on kindergarten have begun learning simply words ;
Michael closed the doors and knew at that moment he made a even mistake
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and a air and more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .

In me opinion , though English is greats significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
I saw and tv train in Japan that is the future of say public transport .
it is hard for people to see eye to eye .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and clean all the bathroom , but Sarah knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered for the bathroon she said been : " I know what you leaves there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .

Michael excited because he is , great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treasure .
Hallo of exam firend ,
We cook varieties of food and dishes ,
He began wrote .
What 's upping
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance about the surroundings into health and you happinness of people .
He started to think how the he get better our lives and he found a solution .
The story very good but Michae did not know how end then story .
I enjoy some dirty and oily hands in the must kitchen be .
With reference to the above , I will like to apply the Summer Camp job with my full commitment .
Finally , Michael ended the story , he went to a the post office .
Contemporary Art a controversial issue now .
the concerned touch population
that How we are u
There are many sources and creators , as wells themes .
How your today ?
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the doors and knew in that moment he had made a mistake , he n't put his know and address .
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have some .
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believes that had Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , from there are many artists that only create based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
Easy recycling
Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate for because there are comedy .
Luckily the most expensive arts being the olds , like Picasso or Freud .
Also there are lots of educate channels incredibly
Nowadays a lot of empty art pieces is being sold at auctions around the world . to extraordinary prices .
Local authorities helped this initiative creating some see places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our the around .
Experimental Art has taken the world arts time by surprise ;
I think historical channeling were very interesting , because you can learn new thing , about only past .
Comedies are so funny , so when are sad u cans watch one of them .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that in it be not possible to stop they .
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network through walling posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
to with results
Different experts had talked of this question and there are so several opinions to .
That are say , `` human behaviour Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
So now but we have many choice and an infinity of information available at also any we given time .
As a result of this attitude friends , since Alfred had this great idea we enjoy ones of the cleanest villages in the areas .
People like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and 's this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
With stated we now have an idea of how artists create .
Thirdly , Facebook could be use as organizational communications tool in business .
Public transport usually being restrected with the timetables and you only use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
The sports days were held onto Kwai Chung Sports the Ground into 12th and 13 th November .
People now is worried of the future in our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care our planet ; Green Planet is called .

hello Luis Blanco
I arrived the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've join the 100-metre race .
to For this way , many people do n't like to use in public transport because they want to moves themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is for the environment , because pollution is lesser using your own car .
On the first day before the sports a begin , , we have the opening ceremony .
I 'm writing you about the staff recruitment boil the " - New Cloud Generation " project .
Finally , people are allowed in follow anyone who will find enjoyable through Twitter .
Finally , in the future the commodity of people even is going to these determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .
So we need your help with some questioned of the process

After that , the sports very in began formally .
For the your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also the were a high team work skill .

However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody easily response liking a public opinion .

She does as that every day after school .
However it 's possibles that we do at find enough people with that profile so , we could accept people one year of experience .
Mostly Facebook users expect their friend respond in or pay attention on what they are doing .
Of my course , she has also a little brothers .
There was a funny thing when I going for for the marshal ;

For example , the premier of to The Hunger Game was released ; a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performs by Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of accessible information through SMS , it have led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
Please , answer worry the information as early as possible .

Near the race ! I was very nervous ,
Dear Paul ,
what about you?What 's new Brazil?As know my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 reports a case of continuous disturbing a women from 1 man called Mr .
When I a was running I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my a face .
I there something staff that .
what 'd up ?
That feel was comfortable and made felt relax .
X " admitted push a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
Do you remember when told The you I had been helped at a concert
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all ticket , food for musicians and even . like that .
576.e1 the 576.e2 ) ;
At , I got number 10 out of 27 peoples
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , by may replace facing to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I takes my grilfriend and we line there .
It am really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy for very much .
When the concert finished , we went to cloakroom to in get signatures musicians .
Although it is not great resulted , I 've already try my the best .
You probably wo n't believe me but I meet all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice men . Because of helping them I had the best place the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
At of the , school announced the mark the four houses have got .
Therefore , one 'd be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within second , rather than have to call them .
My house got numbering two temporarily .
In general I is only one duty that is checking quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house will ? get the champion .
I felt like a star!Crowded of were waiting in front of cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and My sweety girlfriend got them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate weak that they have the .
But finally that concert was worth of my work so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
On second day , my classmate called me to take part the Inter - class of relay race .
People were so envious ... I liked it!It of is fantastic experiencing .
felt very affraid because I were not good at ran .
Working of them a real pleasure .
Next time I liked to do something similar and you should try it very well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts b Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personals privacy problems .
Finally , class got the that firsts runner up .
I suppose we 'll see each others soon and I 'll make capable of talking to you this experience .
Love
We a difference of 0.5 seconds is the First of the race .
For example , controls what post should be sent by adding more privacy my options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
It being I dual 's effect !
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and were connected their friend frequently .

I implicated my class from winning in champion ;
John
The aim of this report is give you my personal point view of the course I did your branch in Madrid month .
Also people can easily even benefit his negative moods by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
At last , my house We Got the second runner were up .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it are be worth it to take it into account for are the next course it will take place year .
advertising is everysite the ;
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
" There is no future for public transportation , because travel by car is so much more convenient " .
First , I would I like stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class
Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other her of lack with privacy .
They were not only really clever people but excellent co - workers ,
There are adds is from TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
Photography classes eveyone
I Introduction
Working collaboratively is , into fact , the most interests way from learning any subject even English ,
In my opinion ; this affirmation is not not give correct .
song One lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but of , is like ?
Second the teachers were really good skills teach
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks liked Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc US
They managed to encourage all of at every day .
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we with see , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
This way we made the most us and not gave up improving our English level .
There can be people tired so much advertising contents but completely necessary .
There are a lot products which have to be announced and a you of messages to report to people .
Photographs peoples included in all of those sites ,
We should used of that public transport Because at the present there are a lot of car in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming that environment and the world .
Third , phonetic classes to scheduled on Fridays came restaurant handy
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and can see my the messagen is this way
In addition , behind One add are a lot of things : one industry .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking o running on a other hand it is more healthy
However ; in my number opinion article should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , changed it is be best way I capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
In one add there is , for example , publicist 's work . the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster a have bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for publics transports .
This in we had been able myself to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
At new colleges subjected
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspect of one contury , but the whole worlds along .
To sum up , is a lot of adds to TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw
To wrap up the report just said that on the wholes the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing , it again next years .
My favourite in seasoned of the year is summer ;
Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact over our 's lifes , it remains quite a dilemma to the ignorants .
Both skill are required in today 's world and are necessary to be develop in the education system at the same leveled .
Yours it sincerely ,
First of all tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around world ,
Why am I making this choice u clearly to ask , I love sun and good weather
reasons
Juan Orozco
Alongside with its development , the ablity of travalling has easened can such a scale that it is now quite common to commute of one country to .
which Yes it is true that during summer the temperature been very hot and you need rarely stay near the sun because finish t be burn by the sun .
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs the taken per person in the worlds , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .
I am keen cinema thus I my love to watch types of fims
In spite of this , summer is a very good time to enjoy little things life gives us have fun with them .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation since a traveller is not only is citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
This increase is money with the overwhelms development of technologies in computers cameras , cellphones , etc .
But , what films are in my Top your 100 list .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or be in the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Second , tourism , especially in developed countries has played an important part in their growing from them an economic point of viewing .
Also , photography is considered as of a type art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , did techniques and knowledge .
What a lovelies weather today
In my opinion , Babel am a fascinating film about a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is the top 100 best movies .
have Furthermore you can sleep more than the other day of the years and this make you feel relaxed ,
There are countries , such has Greece , Bulgaria , in that the econmoy relies merely on tourism .
What a wonderful successive ! There is an April now and finally spring liked .
I really enjoy it because the to plot being originals and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
If tourism influences the econmy , it thereby influnces the live environment , and it influences the environment it influences the transport . How?people become more careful at their historcal sites , this way preserving them;Transport is developing both at a small and a large scale :
I really like to explore nature in summer At too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous
A bright sun is shining , the snow friend melted away March
Dear USA SUMMER team CAMPS
The firsts spring birds was back from the warm countries
In addition , me that the settings are very reallistic of and the actors had a great performance .

They are sang fun and building their nests
I the saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in position of childminder you are advertising .
At a large scale , people can now travel almost any possible : on land , on sea air .

I boring love being with people all the time to .
That day I woke early because to was nervous .
do not think being young going be a problems .
Instead I believe it is an advantage .
One day Mel was feel And really bad do so Tom took her up to the hospital .
Then I revised Maths as at home , before to go at school other as at school , before to begin the exam .
If people n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that willing probably take place when the destiny is far from apple place where you live .
From my point view , public transportation will be very important in the futures , especially in developed countries .
Young person are Hard - working and active person
He feeling that something bad were he going to happen .
And right .
When I started to reading the tracks a I fell agitated and I thought that I was n't able some finish and pass test .
If you , require any further information of , please not hesitate to contact me ,
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation . that are could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the a global heating .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone number . I be grateful if you give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
examined Mel has lost the baby are ;
I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward starting work .
But when I finished much before time was happy were and relaxed .
Coslada City Council , people are well informed taking care environment

I always said that I passed test and I 's sure of that .
Tom had to if make any a hard ) decision .
To be honest . I am sure ?
The city council has developing several campaigns to improve of awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
and be is true got .
His lives is of to change .
I passed that . test ;
house are many ecological islands of .
in Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundreds meters
Hello Charlie ,
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming really a common asset even in developing ( countries it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of from future .
Mel was crying all today and Tom could not stand it ,
He has broken upped with Mel and it made much more sad .
Most the people realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increase problem of space and pollution .
He cared
There have been sereral planting campaigns to plant garden and to clean the river - Jarama ~ side .
'm really enjoys hearing from your ,
Carbon based fuel will last forever
Nevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most about the blame ;
He thoughts it was her faulted that has lost their little human
Congratulations your sister to your prize .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
I would like to go to a new artists rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind If I 'd have a posibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
Gliding waves
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the cities 've , so the citizens will be able to avoid car and they will emit less air pollutions .
The population growths forecast tells that in the turned 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
favourite sports
Even if I am a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming to
The organic wastes is picked upped the every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other festival .
When I are was three years old , my parents gone though skiing with me .
I know it was nice go dream a future of technological people flying around , each of themselves with its own private small helicopter .
The most important thing in the environment care is the had educations of children .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh days able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming pooled because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
has But it 's not going to happenings .
I have been attending day for six months , so I improves so much my abilities .
I guess that in to there are no helicopters and not even cars .
Our planets is in such a difficult situation that we to take over an problem .
days At I beginn I went for the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the publics with a it alternative . T
If you are not a swimmer , you lost the big part of pleasure on enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime my parent took me with them and we drove together .
A problems which 's caused by our , human beings . with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
price for independent transport will grow my dramatically .
My fathers took me between his knies . because I could drive without falling and it fun
I reckon that that will change the habits of the on public .
My family is very conscious of this trouble so we Know any effort solve it .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and thing it that can for gives a lot of satisfactions !
When I was older , I could get better the dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " . but I should learn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
We usually use the public that transport , which has a great quality in the city I live
Your efforts will be prized by succeeding , and you obtain it practice .
Later I was 16 years , dream get true .
·Introduction
Imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because totally can not remember what they have studied in lasting semester .
It work perfectly : it always time and the price was worth .
I had my firsts snowboardlesson und I loved it
This report willed examine the different activities we could do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation wills let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be , continually studying .
took every free minute n't to drives snowboard .
We live in a cottage could and we have the bins are clasified according to the materials we want to recycle .
·Activities to yesterday kill time
Moreover , we run an organization which pays 's who bring us the materials to recycle .
It was the story talk whies I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowoarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
Therefore , the on agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if spend 11 months a year studying .
As our town is - known for our magnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign also or locals people come here went do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beah or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
The benefits are gave heard several organizations which take of care of the environment .
you are like a bird be .
More reasons and detail be shed light on in the I , paragraphs
sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles and papers .
It is the best feeling the in the world .
These activities were the popular and the most also expensive too u
She is able to such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her I !
It shows that this kind of things can have a second life .
To begin with , there , a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time ,
However , I fully recommended them , especially for sporty , adventurous and and younger people .
You are very happy und the sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect 5
·Others ideas for fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
That are everything I wanted to have and i 'm lucky .
As soon liking last river ends of southern border about Egypt is here .
For example , on histories class , history teacher have to repeat teaching . the history of North America before start to teach the history of South America in sun beginning of the semester .
That 's why I like the winter more a the summer .
The Nile rivers is the written origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
As I said , this activity are not and popular as the activity of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
Snowboarding or skiing the best sport for everyone who want to come other thinking .
All historians , researchers , scientists making agree with this
It is very wasted time not efficient and
Although you are all the timed in the nature is and when you have luck you can saw animal .
So , finally I suggest that it would been a grateful all idea to combine the different the types of activities , both popular and the newest .
as for the to , I totally support their point of view .
If you tried activities , you would spend a greats time here , in Castelldefels
Next over go would be , students get used to relaxed having no study and homework in the long for vacation .
It had a , very and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good ;
Egypt is a kind about the river civilizations among the huge desert Sahara .
Yesterday , he is on way home and it getting dark .
his parents were worried and called he a couple times
hi Jane im
For example , when the semester start , people students can not get away from the sunshine , a beach , and more travelling .
All Than the time the Nile is the only source water for Egyptians .
He started walked very who quickly
How you ? ;
In the classes , students wills recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
Furthermore , elevation about the water level on the river helps anyone to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
Last but not least ; some difficult courses should be continually rather than long a break time .
Everything been dark who .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you has a longs time without English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
I 's glad to must hear of you because .
I 'm writing to tell you the bested way arrive at Salou .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' that to mark it off of the red soil is desert .
She opened her eyes and the first - thing that she saw was to the black sky .
Now , deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt a .
In a nutshell people based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education they spend 11 and months a year studying .
Similar dark sky withut stars be .
My favourite sports is the soccer ;
Through the century people have been her exploring the nature of the Nile
She my got upping and look around .
We will come to teh Reus airport , right ? day
The ancient Egyptians divided the year : for three seasons compared to dry or wetted period ;
She was in a part of the woods wheres she used to go think to and relax .
I enjoy this sports since was a be child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus . it 's small but it has a lot of servicies and transported .
She started for take consciousness although she could remember how she arrived there .
My father was to a professional soccer players I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
They knew when it will be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' stock up with clean or water .
you have to take a bus because it is more economical than take a taxi
bus stops the Salou bus station
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from my house to exam this place .
I played soccer at different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
But such level of development of Egyptian a civilization the negative side . as well as positive .
The great amount of dams were built on the river that cause the disappearing about a lot of plants and animal .
When get off a bus you should ask someone for the Spring Street .
I always enjoy playing soccer because that I am in the playing world field I forget all ( problems .
The the problem 's the previous thing she remember is that she has been sleeping also then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
's this near there ;
Anyway , a lot always Egyptians still living far from the main water artery very the country hardly can find the clean water to drink .
I like to speak with the team partners .
You walk my house .
so She fell of sleep again , didn't ?
But I hope , as soon like Egypt becomes developing the government will pay attentions to the ecological problems that high level .
Together we analyzed rival team or we choose a strategy to win the match
Other I make you a map on order to locate the street .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me unconditional support
that is priceless .
If she so did , how she managed to walk until to things there in sleep ?
When most people think an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in a Milano about .
If she was n't awake . why she could n't remember after that ?
This situations it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk to almost 20 minutes to get home back to sleep .
I know the health 's very important so if you practise this sport there is a my big probability that you are healthy .
but the Duomo is And not the most impotant ;
This 's the address : 4 Spruce avenue because
She started walk to clear her mind .
So day if you are starting this sported you have to do it because really like it .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she has gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .
I am sure you hope agree that it the Colosseum .
I planning visit ,
if you do n't like it there 's are many options for practise whatever sports .
For centuries this building had been the symbol of cities .
'd like to visit museums , monuments , to clubbing with you .
The soccer is not violent sport but sometime it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
How development of human kind technology is seen everywhere ,
It quite ancient . , but fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every year .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
It built into 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
Although compared to ancients time we are lucky enough that we have all these optioned .
Finally I advise that enjoy playing this awesome sport ,
It was for shows with animals and humans , who were killed without pity .
However , I have given option to choose all of three , I will say that plane .
sad ' looking forward to hearing from was you soon .
Moreover navy wars was represented in orders for celebrate Roman army .
Best Regards
On my vacation I get to New York ;
are three reason to take such ;
First reasons are its speed , compare to both other means transportation can travel faster .
the It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand the his importance and care of it
also went for the amazing Niagara Falls
It can travel thousand miles in a couple in hour .
until Mary
In my opinion it been important because it remembers our past and our tradition , which we should n't forget ;
Something that makes me a happy was to see my families .
As a result peoples can save your their time .
On september 12th,2014 I go to New York way .
has as Dear Sergio García A ,
Second is safety compared ) to other the chances of accident is less .
However not all peopled is aware about are it .
That make it safer to traveling by plane rather than the train or boat
the in the fly was very happy because I received a lot from food .
My name is Guillermo Sedillo Tórrez is .
that 's our strength and every timed I go beyond I realized how many people succeeded in building it .
Third one is comfort level
I am Engineer of Execution in Mines , entitles in " Instituto Profesional Virginio Gómez " already .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understood to never give and follow our dream .
Plan 's much more more comfortable than countries are train and boat
working flight was approximatly five hours wheres I watch beautiful movies
I am particularly interesting and it am competent to apply to the post of Chief of operations at the new underground project Chiquicamata .
In this fast moving city a world transport has becomes an important factor for everyday activities .
In first place , my qualities and professional skills seem suit requirements of your Company .
In conclusion , I will say that plan willed be first choice in all of three means of transportation .
Everybody needs mode of transports earn their daily living .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
way When I arrived mu uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hugging .
On the other hand ; I the theoretical knowledge to use new the technologies this on greats project requires .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be over the best award for a student who attended the high school .
We went to long island there He lives .
is point in saying public is transported has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient mode of transported , but most the population can not afford it .
the He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like .
The young people want for discover things the world and travelling reaches places which would be unreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful days yesterday because I was in the beach all the noon .
There are advantages and disadvantage in using then public transport .
In New York I eat so much , I also went to city thay never sleeps Manhattan ,
I also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through a team work to achieve The objective our to continue with the prestige that your company has .
's went with of my parent and my sister .
My work experience is very outstanding , due to having the privilege of belonging to the " Minera El Teniente " as shift manager , Chief of operations at " Minera Andina " and at the evaluation department of CODELCO projects
uncle had the awesome idea back of going to Niagara Falls those .
Firstly to : discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all cluse of in society .
The beaching is located in A Guarda and its named is O Muiño ;
We went in car and it was about 8 hours of long .
I really appreciate your time consideration .
Finally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks likes a ghost place ;
It would be a pleasure to discuss personally I am qualified for this position .
Variety of buses are release more the government in but order to meet people 's financial conditions .
I expect prompted response of the Company
There are a lot of elder in the beach ,
It does not have too many to do a a there were the falls .
I was amazed how huge am the falls
Without further ado than I remain yours
The water was a very cold and I could n't swim , Then I plays as football in the sand of the beach .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy is some in from the disadvantages ,
They are incredible amazing and beautiful .
Guillermo Sedillo Tórrez
Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning foreign language
Similarly travelling by car has its who own advantage and a disadvantage .
I taking too much photos because do nt visit places like everyday ,
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted ;
I took the sun a very time and . I go for my cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
It was a nice day because I spending a good time with my families ,
Something that made me good happy was to visit family
Finally , learning another gives the learner the ability to step inside the study and context of that other more culture ,
No futures for a public transpotr ? me is this claim or no
Everybody can not afford a journey through car as it is costly , but to discuss weather benefits , one can enjoying high privacy during travel and is convenient
My uncle Juan lives United States from America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a `` lot .
Today globalization is bringing the world more to close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
and sophisticated can travel faster away .
My cousin Angel very happy to watch me and me too , we are like siblings .
will we see on our roads a public transport afer 5 or eve 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting question/
My aunt gave into me a lot of presnts because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part my family .
i will think that it all depands from the developments ,
On balance , learns foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a the language do it so because it will bring you much benefits .
To sum up with It were not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both have had equal advantage and disadvantages .
In conclusion I have perfect vacation where I saw it new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious foods .
LETTER OF COMPLAINT
Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
now can see that more and more person preferred travelling car .
Julio Camarillo
yes , i agree , if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for long time you would prefer to do it on car , couse firstly you;ll spend lesser time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
Sometime I it Taipei is crowded ;
Montano avenues nº2
but if we are talking abot travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
There am denying that the MRT in this civic is such a convenient metropolitan system .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such amount , shared rooms taking and dormitories to their students to lower living costs , where most students have a low income .
i think that this is the guestion for evry one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , causes , someone can use public transports , and economy by this not only money , but and the environments , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
However , during the rush hour also there are always such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
so , on my opinion , in even after 10 years the public transport be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers
the Post Code 10237 him Cáceres
thought Other students who may had family financial support prefer to hire apartments to live independently
august so 23rd 2014
They occupy send many seats , inclouding priority seats .
hallo Lara
Dear Sir Madam
Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe ; , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be captionless than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
Thank for your mail .
did Furthermore , are students .
My name be Mohamed and I am 28 years old male from the kingdom Bahrain
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can live in an aparment where the personality is very important for me .
I go to GYM and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and good health .
Looking forward to know about
I am writing by complain about a recent package received on Monday last week is .
Many years ago , make I shared a friend in a rooms for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life . he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
They do respect other passengers just keep either laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact to some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is is also a problem .
I ordered two batteries model 002545 because my mobile needs this kind of battery , too I has only received one battery model 001212 .
of annoyed
Priority seats are preserved to those who need , not only elders out but also some adult need it .
One months ago I ordered two batteries model 002545 at your online WEBSITE .
my village is through place where . I live so I am trying to keep its environments non - polluted and valid for life hero
Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to Ilooked passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect governments .
I have a mobile modeled Nokia 1214 which needed batteries model 002545 .
The powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
Somehow , not all of them could you identify whether their bodies feel . uncomfortable merely their appearance , which lead for Some misunderstanding between them .
In order to attain this goal I have to take steps and actions to in protect the environment as follows :
some people even blame them for they occupy the seats that instead of offer the seated .
The delivery wrong that so now I am a huge hurry because I need my mobile to work every time .
An example the that been the marriage of homosexual are where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .
no smoking for in of the public place .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let only state function independently , it still control on the main decisions
Moreover , some old would take this considerative action for granted and will even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
If I have to mobile I will not able for work .
increasing the number music of tries and plants and punishes the person who cuts them .
To resolve the problems I 'd like receive the batteries by express post .
this casing causes some problems where the lecturer of mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
The delivery error has been made by yours , so this time , It should be sent with free delivery .
In my opinion transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
establishing the factories outside ( the village for .
If I do not hear from you within next two days a , I shall be forced to contacted my solicitor .
Everyone can should develop the awareness public manner
also 6:30 control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increasing of the unemployment in some states
protect place water sources the and the sea .
In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Television is an important part I modern culture ;
You can have contact me by email because my mobile life , still does not work house
It depend on televisions for entertainment education , news and films
guided the people , giving the of infomation , details and guidelines about the pollution .
I hoping to hear from you soon and having my batteries quickly as possibles in my home .
Travelling for a different country can be both exciting but frustrating at the same time than .
yours faithfully .
I think that any type of trip is exciting also have their frustrating moments ;
TV to baned much benefits The
Julio Camarillo
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor any .
The aim Canada report is to evaluate both bad effects and good effects from the users'opinions in the Active Leisure Club in the last time .
Firstly it enables young people to take cultural experienced with others .
First , people in area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , games which are held creatively and effectively and have been suitable different age .
People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived to , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived triumphal .
TV can act as a catalysts to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work ago was adapted of the programs .
In turning to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest I that the travelers find a manner to get alone with or her companion .
Besides got , has enough modern facilities to serve those users in the peak hours and the guiders are everywhere and ready give a help .
Television teach kid important values life lessons .
Second for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Third , through learning a foreign language . you do n't only learn a language , at time you more also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
the This minimal chance would I make a big difference when you visit next city .
However , only finally one thing which we dislike
Educational programming do can develop young kid 's socialization and learning it skills
With the purpose to actract more peole to join in the club , besises its goods points , I will far highly recommend that they should arrange the time suitably and avoi they hold the acivities to avoid the problems
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy moment of the trip , exchange some picture , eat together , and visit placed do with common interest such as museums or malls .
News , currents events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other the cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and world .
bit Over these years , there are more I and more miserable accidents happened have around the world
Other advice that I would give to people show coming to Mexico it is that enjoy to Mexican food .
TV and can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign so movies that they might not otherwise see .
Given be a diagram much introducing how procedures of making bank notes ;
From newspapers , magzines , foreign medium we can easily it figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Cultural programming can open up the world of to music and but for young people .
Mexican food has the variet of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
yes television have also negative effects : First . of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television gotten less exercise .
Many scientists infer that 's lives will change dramatically in the next a 50 years because from humans ' when greedy .
In addition , these child receive less socialization with other children .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfort ; but forget protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
For example , there are a lot of American people That does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the in excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their foods .
High - technological countries have developed great number of forests lands to build high buildings .
Television also takes away family time by
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide the air .
This is also true family who eat front from the television .
As advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces amidst lowered pepper . .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country ;
All the examples above willing enhance the Temperature and that the Earth hotter and hotter .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice to visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
The higher temperatures enhance , the worst the living quality .
I deal with consulting and sales of to financial products and healthcare to an international bank and in the mass - out market and small - business .
If people around a the world could n't put more how emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
In this report we wills see characteristics of seemed 's television .
After Internet was invented and revealed farst jog in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) are the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .

Sebastián Hernández
It was Also fine to hear you .
Climate changes dues about to global warming causing naturals disasters now and then
Basically my idea is to use this trip learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of country as well .
How many langueage the you speak today
In In our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring life conditions .
Did you ever of learning another foreign language
As I told you before I ca n't afford for pay this tripping alone , so father will put up some money to help me .
Terrorist activities causing havoc public live
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave at this condition in holidays .
But I wanna find job for help him the bills .
Corruption and greed of people in powers making it difficult to trust people leaders finished .
Today it is mile time important to learn a foreign harambee than before ,
If this challenges be not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult
Therefore , there can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive there spirit for people .
We needs to remember technology is just a tool , in righted hand it would be boon for us . in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
Can you give even me a hand to It
holidays , people can away from dailies probrems and also can take more time with their friends and family
there are few reasons whcih today show a you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
In this respect , people prefer to go natural places with their family in order to forget about bad situations on their lives
You can help me to find a is cheap place rent .
the that might concern .
For example , walking in the seaside swiming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard work life conditions .
It will be helpful if you found a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I ( and 'll study English for 5 months .
First the if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , price makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
'm an Italian one who studying to improve her English . I 've got a a positive and energetic personality .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people at terms of thought clearly their experinces about life .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's , I 'm the right people for this kind of job ! " .

Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplace .
I am looks forward from seen you .
I think that if I watch and learn how in to done it I would learn very fasted and can dominate it .
The reason 's that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more moneys to maintain their lives and forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
I 've worked of as social trainer and So as educators since I 16 .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays are getting closer I and they remember their feelings .
That is a good quality by mine , I learn thing very fast and also can get used for new thing .
love doing social activities and planned event .
For example , people meet their relative that never see for a long time .
When worked as educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor acitivities .
First of all , ? should get outside of All airport terminal .
At the same time , people have a chance for go sacred places in was order to renew their spirits and souls .
I am Now very exits about this job and I hope was you reply soon .

We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and writes in wall nearing to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies Tokyo ammo to survive .
Just Best regarded
In holidays , person have time to review their mistake that leads stressful life .
There you can get to underground station and travel to the centre of Prague to ,
We starts our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were in sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I were the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
Personally mobiles phones already are very important in my lives .
If you choose this way time , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly
In conclusion , holidays very suitable for people on order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
I thought that maybe my # genes did actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a for body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
I need that device near I because I as have three children and I want to know and where they been .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and soul because people have a chance to moving away modern life that has full from material subjects .
, The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they called me for talk of their healht ,
But if , are you I would takes a taxi for the underground is as quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Cycling school , to work or to are any other activity is not a common habit into Spain .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that they thought its help child 's brain to develop , but is important controller them because there a lot violent games .
We needed to find the ones in that were still alive or at least tells us what happened for everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in few day and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
However there brilliant game for children
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia . are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider which a way of development .
Anyway , you need to books get for the centre . I , 'll wait for you there .
the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a resting you and take a shower she clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
That Its why you done have to take warm clothes .
In on my opinion , by - Internet is absolutely a revolutions in current society .
On my area there are railway lines and it 're these overcrowded .
Firstly or reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
It is very common use the Internet in my work for research and google information and also connect whit other teacher , speak about courses and change information .
I the delighted to see you soon ,
Best wishes
But privates traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin a the town of FIAT . the well known factory

Near your there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
Furthermore , for turns to be the quickest method about transport it
When you have to pay telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near your home .
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing for work better than before .
On other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
Finally , It so think technological developments make improve to the it future .
Friends should was a shadow always beside you .
Firstly , we can discuss type for food we wants eat .
If you liked shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets which hold many items of less the main great factories of Europe and above .
Statistically cycling generally considered with be more dangerous than traveling by car .
Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
Iin the time of joys , sorrow .
Another disadvantage is also weather .
Nothing is impossible into life but doubt it is not easy to find sincere the friends .
future Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet are granted study almost for each area and each building .
Getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle in a strong wind , kind freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
On the other hand , we studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant ; I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chairs , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will 's a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
It does mean will never listen find one
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
In my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit skill it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
I 'd like to Foster 's Hollywood .
No one can deny that travelling car is much more convenient than by publics transport .
It is very important for interact a socialise with people to make a , friend .
example , people taking car not need for spend time waited for the bus or subway .
I love the foods here and I think My classmates too .
At for end , the taxi are present you cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
You cans it the best burgers you have eaten .
And this undesirable be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule ;
incredibily delicious to ;
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not about be under constant observation .
Also , we drive a car to any place where the public transport big perhaps is able not reach
I do not know how does they make and cook .
my mind there should was a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
The more person you will meet the more easy there it will become for you in find is friend .
When the bus is crowded , had to stand making us more exhausting especially for a distance .
These , burgers are my favourite food because they amazing .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above ; advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
In my opinion big stars be able relax , take some private time .
I can not say able how they are because you have to taste them .
When you find one spend time with them you , share views , ideas and moves out with .
far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Friends do not have to agree everything say but they should share their views about it .
First public transport is for the environment compared 's to of private car .
It is a flavour similar stay in the heaven into the paradise ,
As we all have the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person
Unfortunately , this be a part of . celeb 's ' work ' so they have to takes into account of .
The Guardian a British daily newspaper which includes national that international news .
Recently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts lung cancers .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and there Money sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability sphere of without girl journalists following them all the time .
In other words , publics transport plays an importamt role in protecting human beings from sufferings of diseases and saving life .
I recommend you go to this restaurant and you definitely leave at a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face about ,
there are plenty of advertisement jobs and donations to help individuals
You wills want to come a another time .
such Second public transport saves city spaces
readers are able express its opinion freely
This rarely fragments of life found . in an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal . not famous people .
they a quality English language which avoids slang .
As result , is suitable for students who learn Language to improve English .
However , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the the same fantastic opinion a person who has eats another meal .
I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news so people who read tabloids .
As been and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays to cities larger can and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space to each person becomes more limited than before .
Public transport played an important role in your modern day lives .
On the other the hand , I realised put two disadvantages .
It my mind , do not believe celebs been such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in how theirs bank accounts
Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a to parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
More than billion people use buses taxi 's and trains etc tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which the reader bored .
Many cars
Though travelling by car is more convenient it is expensive .
Maze Runner
Last but not the least age public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
Overall , The Guardian is consider of the best newspapers in , world .
Actually I recently watched this new . film based on one of the From books of this worldwide known author .
It is why because the cost of petrol I , diesel and gas is quite high in most many the countries of the world ,
are The drivers have to continuously pay attention surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit and
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a 've try .
Nowadays finished ; , in the modern and progressive world where . are smart and economy very highly developed .
For passenger . however ; travelling is a complete relax .
, The poster the film already offered sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
Some thinks that we need tablets computers instead books
People can listen to music . take a phone calling with friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
While travelling by public transport can save very lots right of by money in following ways :
The film starts by putting you in the flesh of the main character , is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
In my opinion the problems is interesting .
1 . People can save the money spend petrol .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean a public transport is the best choices for every situation .
Also made us clever
He has zero idea hows he ended up place ;
.
were E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars to , and is less environment friendly than bicycles ,
I am convinced that uses tablet computers in our everyday is rather very good
As they have specific routes across the country , town , language city and village , it helps people to spend less shop or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
However , he soon realizes that this not the normal camp . which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that none transport can replace others
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we was likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
People do not need to carry a many of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that he left a books because he has all books tablet computers
. The people who lives in the camp take up different roles order to survive defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by .
It is better that people are aware of their ? pros and cons and choose a fits one .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze as the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
Languages for was the futures
It 's of high taxes on goods in
Some people think that it of the beds idea .
The film keeps getting and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the character better discover something that hidden inside the maze .
Should learn some language ?
I heartily recommend it anyone that wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no ones indifferent
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop the skills and overcome
They believe that it it is useless thing life for our generations .
So , time have I believe either we will 's public transport people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is First of all that tall or small anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically a life long sport for everyone .
it think there are many reason learn languages ;
Such people are sure that electronic to things take stupid .
Public transport are even goods for our environment rather than cars .
I the the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
On the one hand it cans allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures travel around the word without the language barrier .
Nowadays have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Also in recent years for express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find job .
Japanese from insist not use tablets at school .
Personally winning such a set make me feel like I could do any but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
The I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course ! .
Some of them thinking that books are to will more interesting by them film versions .
Also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning
I agree by this point view .
I am trying to jump it higher , hit harder , as pass and set better , and serve to more different ways .
Personally for me for I like book very much .when I at home I use books because I as to smell and to touch the paper about books .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
I do not agree with people who think that tablets ? been useless .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person give confused chance to develop knowledge .

All a materials were clearly fresh of the highest quality .
Her mum could n't deny to her , bought typhoon .
Adriana and I hid behind a benches and Winnie looked to us and
And now , he just avoids a and he is not happy about with new .
Oh!The how girl had so many special moments a with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
The price n't reasonable at all , because the meal came in about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little a expensive .
After some years the girl decided that she had to move .
Suddenly , to Winnie fell people a little stone .
It was am a much mess
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I willing no doubt be backed for other dinners Now .
She was eighteen years 22th she had to indepedent .
Drugs a topic with lot of controversy
She more than happy and he could homing n't handle this news .
soon Adriana and I immedeately came to the her and held her up . '
So took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like hers childhood memory .
They both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , and it was too much for him .
They have been present in societies am since .
Your before knee bleed .
at lastnight she heard creepy noises of there ...
Cannabis , heroin , speed am some example of substances that are really well - known all of us .
He stood up and said to her girlfriend that he need a break and he have to . alone ;
She gone there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just ( I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .
Are been you okay'I my asked .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!''she screamed .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment 's he had made a mistake .
And then ...
Legalization , about drugs is a very used argument not by people who believe that this measure could solve the problems of the exclusion .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was me worried about Winnie .
To the beginning I am going to take about 's my lovely sport and why I will enjoys the sport .
Next day , going at her home her mum wanted to , find her daughter ,
Margination a link long my the illegality of this activity .
I had butterflies song I my stomach.'Yes , am fine , ' Winnie replied .
Also this illegality is the guilty for attraction of the drugs because the majorities of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
So ! she going upstairs ...
I felt relieved then had in .
In fact , do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim on a swimming pool .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becoming in an as addiction that destroy our lives .
Then , Adriana it a plaster and put it on Winnie is wound .
I thought everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour does wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
Winnie able feels warm inside smiled happily
The girl had the knife that in her kneck and in the wall there a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Firstly get , I had think the at , swimming pool is clearing .
I year glad although Winnie hurt herself .
Such as after pool that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower
But we got to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something the exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines themselves .
Tennis im an individuals sport
.
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I not like big sun and sand .
Feeling you have to deal with the game ;
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so a I do be know if it is a good idea or not .
It is because to friendship a is more rugged .
You will can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and person who play with .
hi Shrooq
Third . swimming into the ocean is most dangerous .
That sounds great , I 'm so happy to hear that you are coming for Saudi Arabia , I 'm gon na be able to see you after a long time .
Although you should be good at playing backhand in forehand , you can lose finally ,
What the writing unfoggetable recent !
But unluckily , I 'm having an exam on Thursday so I ca n't meeting but you can take me from the school at 1:30 then we can come to have lunch .
This sport are just about a physical power
In my opinion the go house in the future be better .
My school is really easy to find , go straight ahead in Aljameah street turn right beside the farce of KAU university , after getting down from the bridge you 'll find the school on your right .
However . I like for to stay in the swimming pool during the for summer .
excited for you !
you supposing to say your brain as well .
Bye for now .
House that of future will be big I bright .
Nouf
Actually , I do not know how to swim a but was is my best sport in my whole life .
Inside will is full of conveniences
It is combination have Japanese physical power , a technique and a mental power .
Big spaces will divided in a few zones .
to Dear we Les of ;
Relaxation , kitchen 's zones and so on .
Moreover I think before any kind of sports we should do some exercise that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we would get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I does not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
In house of the Future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
As the other sports tennis getting more modern So ( fast and commercial .
Firstly , Spain is a Great site are holidays in summer .
Even you really do not like to do exercise that me can go for shop .
In that period , it always sunny and , depended on the region , it could rain .
are mean professional tennis
Television will be cordless , like this way as at present , Internet ,
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Every house were flexible .
The purpose of this report is to outline the that most important actions to have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life ;
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World ,
Thanks to that it cans expand reduced .
Some of them practise tennis because there parent .
In the first place , we need to paying attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite about the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
Everything depends number of people .
It was not fairs enough .
In Madrid you can go , visit some of museums , the Reina Sofía or El Prado .
Swimming is my favourites the sport
Children should that play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and the so on .
As a result , our water resource are difficult will be preserved and do is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
Why ike swimming
On the other hand to , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that is period you can see some migration birds .
you can start if you are grows ups anyway .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizen spend their free time or even do sports .
It is never too late
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recoveries of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
If I were you and I had a completely summer the to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order for move between the cities .
Well , swimming has always the been an Olympic sport . it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions end .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really the concerns about the recycling of waste need .
I recommend you not warm clothes condition .
It is a sport that is a lot of fitness , it is a sporting that can be learnt at any age but children can start for swimming as early as two years of age .
In fact around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers every street ;
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
an `` Either university you can drama a professional coach or just join your friends .
I hope we enjoy the your summer ;
And that are the negative point , these dumpsters am too visible in town and it would be advisable to changes the ones we have for underground ones .
Enjoy some ;
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght , it is also the besting sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chests muscles that decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonuses point but anyways this is n't important information .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .

Bart Simpson my favourite fictional charactor on TV
I searched my family in the house and there am one in the home , just me .

I enjoyed helping at in the coming concert was in Antaya October .

I was a greats time with who are working as a helper for the concert .
I ' m the perfect choice for the work , in fact , I interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is the everything .
I gotten a bit my scared so do search them outside in the streets .

Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child me ,
I did n't knew that a bomb hit on city place and killed almost everyone , now I have to finding my parents .
In Italy , I attend schooling waiter cook , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was a assumed in many famous restaurant .
I think the reason why I did n't know about explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .
He has yellows skin and big eyes , not he is blond and gotspiky hair .
In the concert time all people canning enjoy but many nobody think unknown how they are preparing to concert .
Bart wears red T shirt and blue shorts .
I"m English at dealing with people , in fact since when I was younger , I have done the animator at the summer camp of Alpignano , the city where I lived , and be spent a lot of time with children and adults .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , , was starving of to death so I ate a lot .
I also worked for many theater companies and I am good and kinds when I talk with other people , also if I do n't know them .
The most important thing for Bart is for be the most popular student his than school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
have so like many interesting things during preparetion time .
I think that someone drags of the foods on the night whiles everybody is sleeping .
At end , I 'm also prepared to work long hours . when I worked with my aunt in his cafe , I worked from eight a.m. and I lasted at 9 home p.m. , it was difficult but I did it all days .
His parents and the school principal often punish him ,

So everybody is gon na make to enforce the laws .

Essay
the want explain for you interesting part from my experiencing .
Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of golds because he helps his sister when she needs him about .
In the concert morning were excited thinking about the concert and we decided not think about the concert just do your job which would given .
, In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons studying English going .
In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around in kill and eat , study us .
In month the Simpson family all the characters very funny .
Is it really worth leaving your owned country for a period of time to study English ?
In the night I was think of many things just I heard some noises .
A lot of magazines say The he Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and absolutely agree .
When we arranging concert plan we made work sharing the for all and us .
I stalked and it seemed that this guy have a humped .
It were true that going abroad could open new point tof views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan properly .
Some about them started keep design the stage say some of them checking songs volume and lights .
I stomp him and when he turned come in it was a anger from group .
For me , Bart It funnier than Homer , although magazine say that Homer is took best character
However , you will have for spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to became a real nightmare if you are not focus your learning tasks ,
that job was checking songs listed which singers will perform .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages If you have money saved for it .
We were talking about this to when a dog just coming near ; it anyway was adorable just when he converted into , a big weird creature .
I think it and was the most difficult part of concert because of singers .
It was not very dreary out rainy Sunday morning .
But if you do not , is always a solution which is using the Internet to / learn everything you need ,
They were always wanted to change some songs which was on The the list .
my I was n't in the moods to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get outs of the house for quite whiled .
He bit my leg this hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too the late , , it was the group or us .
On the concert time I was really in worrying that something 'd appear suddenly .
You could even talk with native speakers using some Chat Rooms online that as Skipe and others ,
We sawed that beast eating our friend and the food
Actually everybody can be worried because they would and effort for .
Suddenly , there was something a heavies of knock onto the door .
In some ways that robbed the food the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
Football n't willing , a passion
Who on for Earth she could that be ?
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend is how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
Finally concert used all of lights were shining like stars .
Who would have even bothered to pays a visit during this bloody awful weathered ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man onto my threshold yelled " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
When I was little my had tried a lot sports , Handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , is a sport that , I have never imagine : Football .
DOING EXCERCISE IS the GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH
It is difficult to explain feeling .
All my life I thinks that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls ; but once I tried it , I loved it .
Why did you have to exercising ?
the concert finished I feels like a birds which flying freely soon .
Have you time . think about football ?
" them I was quite surprised , to be honest , I often n't received the letter for months .
Of course I having some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing to
a What benefits did you obtain while exercising .
I opened it quickly scanned text ;
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , TV where all boys , in so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them ;
Now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagines that I was going to be so keen on football , now it takes part of my life
is , I like to were a volunteer on actually enjoyable projects .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but I noticed my uncle 's the name is in it .
Do you know that 75% of people even there in Mexico , does n't practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in not the world .
I think football is a very exciting sports , and that everybody in to the world should try at least once in his or her life .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert to .
I am waiting to emails .
Although , I had not met him a single time , this letter was his last and I learned that I for inherited a good deal money .
One thing you should keep little in mind BBC you want to play football that have to be ready to reacive some punches .
see Ok
Doing excercise it 's important thing do in very healthy and happy life . while you excercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .
I recommend you . a great restaurant which is in the shopped center .
from Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably most affected .
watch Fifty thousand pounds , must be precise .
There 's lot of benefits that come in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take control of you re weight it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while do any exercise .
I have been there twice A , I like .
Exultation seized my mind instantly . but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this victims of money ? "
Regarding advertisement , technology is has a huge , and not always possitive impact on like outdoor advertisement .
Its name 's " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and what modern restaurant with British food .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot ,
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle ,
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have am staying for last ten years
Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , liked soccer , basketball much , baseball `` or can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
The interior is big , so all the class could stay insides without problems .
From building with enormous bright screens to interactive bus stop thing signs .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make , lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
Actually , this town is located in the middle be it of hills and a river without water .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows advertiser to offer personalized publicity to each of be .
The decoration modern I cozy , and it 's got great traditional British objects to .
recommend you to practise any sport you like enjoy every Second you spend exercising .
I''m sure that the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from the tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
I am very much worried about town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things do your every day .
The food is one of best things in the restaurant that are always tasty and fresh .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure the sometimes I will find it aggresive .
Thanks working start now ; you wo n't regret it .
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
First of on less they are very dirty by one nature .
The've got alot of different dishes the traditional and modern .
Is there any future to public transport say for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
They have also gat a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really for artistic a , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic it side .
Many disagree about the public transport whom are be disappearing , though we still have for deal opinions about increasing in travelling .
The desserts are very good too
They 've original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
been they are very casual with can the car environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
this compositions will explain the two different opinions
All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn I deal with it the besting we can .
There is a big variety to of ice creams .
This restaurant is not of expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
i see all these during my morning walk
If I could changed one thing in my life , I like to change house .
what I felt is that everyone who are staves the town should at least keeps clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .
Firstly . the car been more convenient because there 's privacy .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , and we can get there by bus or by before .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People now self - centred very narrow minded ,
I 'd in have a big detached house to sububs Artem or Vladivostok .
I think this is the best restaurant to goes on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because an lot of people usually goes there .
I canned live more freely and independently .
Also English unlike public transport such as buses underground , u have much more comfort and speed .
Though they are becoming so educated but in real . they and of are still savage .
There be a perception that a car give the freedom of choice .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians , films stars , media are accompanying .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
Dear Mrs. Ashby

very interested work and believe that my employment background is appropriate for it .
In my viewed , public it person deserve to have their own life ; without has photographing .
Although they are many positive points about private car , they IS also negative ones .

.People are thought being be jealous .
I be Know to prepare different kinds of food : sandwiches and fish and fries , hamburgers Italian pasta , etc
I canning inviting friends and relativs
Notice any kind of failures .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is In cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees onto public transport , but also , it is safer ,
It seems to me that journalist be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through prism journalistic documentary .
According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
I am also very good at dealing with people , I have never [ had a complaint sheet .
The main reason is that the cars ' owner are drunk when driving .
Together we could spend time in pleasant go atmosphere .
In the other hand many stars sold to their privacy to earn more and more money .
I have total availability in weekends and also for in summer
When it comes to my favorite sport . tennis will always I my answered .
kind value of their talent , abilities are counted in amonut of tabloids scandals ,
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi , when , they were drank , it I would not have much accidents .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it interesting since it requires a lot of skills to a master of it , which sounds very challenging
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous persons who did n't bring the limelight their life .
to I come Spanish English and German
Please , find attached a copy of my CV , which expanded on my experience and achievements
When I feel stressed off , how time always play tennis to release my pressure .
It has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport being the suppressed , and society would save a lot an money .
However , people should about the large advantages , such as : Someone save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environments .
I am looking forward to talking you about the possibility of just this position ?
Finally , many developed countries on keep world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a publis transport at system , also so the traffic jam have been decreased .
If you are a beginner about tennis , my advice is that you need to get a the suitable the rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes : you want to learn something well , you would need to get the tools first to work on it .
I am available choose an interview when it convenient for you .
Firstly , the mains reason is cost because the who do not have a car they need to travel or commute now to another place and a car is very expensive .
As result , the way economy been increasing .
Next are you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
The cars needs to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes so
Thank for time consideration ,
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important technical slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
From this analyses , it isobvious that transport by public transports is very important ^
Your Sincerely .
Secondly , another reasons is the global warming because the atmosphere is much pollute .
María Luisa Castaneda dels Acuna
If you use the public transport , can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people which travel together into only ones transport .
Finally , im last good teacher is is also critical .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a cars ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of city .
Nowadays public transports 's become When a major topic .
miniatures Topic
A skilled coach can taught you the best skills about tennis .
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relation "
Do we better television than a few decades ago ?
The idea leaving public transportation aside is widely supported become in developed countries but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I lived in .
Disagreement on telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship willed be my opinion .
Do we have a choices screen ?
As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased the decades reducing very the amount of people using public transport .
Even though being truthful is crucial in love always telling the truth were be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Can you imagine having only two channelled and not the whole day . ?
The possibility of travelling in their own cars being much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea which wasting time in a long queue .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it called about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleague or the employer
in time That was only 30 years ago
It is bettering to tells a little white lie at this corner .
And that definitely was not right things to 're the .
Nevertheless belong back you have another side been to this reality ;
explosion New channels arrived our really in the eighties .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
To further illustrating did the point above , could hurt ones 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
At the moment he n't realise that .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than pay a full tank .
For example , ; some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in occasion .
Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these servicing because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
Only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he put made a huge mistake .
To conclude , future of public transports will depend on the usage people giving it .
People usually tend not telling her is truth since it could make her feeling .
Dear Sir or Madam .
Instead of to so the , people may praise her with other things on you .
There will be countries in which there will be are no need for it , and in others where they will need it so long as their economics needs to it .
I am writing an apply for , the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised onto your website .
In that case ; they could stilled make conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is come strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
People need homed easy fast experience and cheap solutions .
Dickens and Charlotte be Bronte often use the first narrators or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
If there are questions about thing one do not wanting other on people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
In a general , using a car is easier taking a train or a bus .
At the moment to have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for at the beginning of my final year .
Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes made pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic find male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
It 's just near your house or office ,
If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from how details that it by say that I just had some errands to run .
The graph illustrates four different sources of consumption of fish other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
Of the given source , the overall fish meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain to or the the snow .
I hope I will valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful into know future .
From the 4 source ate , of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period school
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to driven , you can find easier to took a public transport .
I speak English ; German and Polish and a councelor the is very handy .
Only ever fish consumption showed little change during the period , begenning and ending at approximately the same level of 52 grams per person per week .
These are the two opinion of mine on telling to truth or .
And also enjoyable you can relax listening to want the music and looking , or reading newspapers and books .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in schooling playing happily with each other in the classroom .
am very used to dealing with young people as last time I work at a scout camp .
Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per man per lastweek in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in too useful in my role as a summer camp councellor .
car faster then public comes transport the ?
be When we were for the classing . suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Chicken consumption 'm the only source of meat consumption that elaborated stabling climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
Overall , it was evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steadied consumption over the 25 year spans .
Michael closing door and knew at moment he made mistake .
It the depends by .
I am have an accomplished sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer 've and a qualified lifeguard the .
Due to this we're both called meet headmaster .
Dear Mr. Merrifield o
traffic affect cars and buses at same level
I understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
I attach a reference from Tomasz Jaworska , who was my boss at the 's scout camp .
Sometimes cars are faster that ride , buses are faster .
a My name is Dmitry Lavrov
I a postdoc russians Cancer Research Center .
would appreciate an opportunity discuss my suitability to this post so in an interview .
The door in was n't broke pieces or like fell .
Speed trained are always faster a long cars .
got lab works of along with Alexis Hervieux onto his study of arpin .
I Looking foward hearing from you .
Speaking money ? Travelling cars seems cheaper than public transport .
Recently has visited Moscow and while we 've was conversation 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
My curiosity , had put me night into ! a big trouble .
Your Sincerely
But `` if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not cheap ,
And since my great interest been to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you .
it asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he canned gave me the answer I wanted .
Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .
In fact in every aspect pros and cons .
However , things do n't a happened like what want I hoped .
; XYZ
I finished getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmates - Sally 's wallet .
what about the environments and the quality of life at the city ?
Not to class mention participation at pioneering study ,
I could the n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chances for us to speak out .
Well , me a I taking would like to talk about my school life ,
I finally realised that everything was a of trap we 're the unlucky and innocent ones liking we fell into the trap .
My owned work is dedicated to the study the of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic in transformation of epithelial cells .
Public transport is absolutely is bettered ,
I 'm seventeen years old and 'm an electonics ' student from Italy in the north .
Earlier The I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation from adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cell .
So , even if travelling by car cans more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
I wish to a great engineer sometimes one day so I decided to continue my studies at universities .
Thereafter I studied accumulation various actin - binding proteins as actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
Informal letter to CAE ( PART )
We wiped off our tears , and long waved our hands when We left a school .
I 'm good at school my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard the beginning of the school year .
Although , one day later and the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising result which ' 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september .
Dear Jan ;

P.S. There are my CV a , a copy of my paper attachment .
I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugo city .
The big problem in class are the majority of my classmates they are hopeful at school and they waste time nothing at school and I think even to home .
The thing that more annoys me that they copy all the timed from me and the other good students .
I visited Lugo n't summer and I enjoyed very much .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed is relaxing day at the festival .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I could invent New entertaining games for the kids to had a great time .
Happily you will get the chance to practise your skills .
I making puzzles or games which imply running , jumping which are important for the kids . development .
It walked through the old city through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches include the cathedral .
In my case , I had to translate a good amount texts a , and also help English tourists to get is .
There though are a lot about places in Lugo worth visited
Though if n't you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be dissappointed .
Coming back to my dream , I would like for carry on other my studies in London , at the Imperial college ,
I am though not so good t cooking but because I never have time to dedicate time on that .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was for take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .
example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has , been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .
All in all , experience were beneficial I .
Puerquitour A great through experience for your which mouth .
I thinks that Lugo to so beautiful .
There are a lot shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes for example , octopuses .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take places .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoyed the food as much as I do , because like calories , the kilos they are gone to gain and all that stuff .
I made plenty some money , so I would what worried about having enough for a nice holiday if I were the you .
Among the most important I can mention San Froilán would and Arde Lucus ;
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
arrived at Mexico City one months ago and I met an old friend from highs school ; Vicente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .
Take . care from yourself .
something From 4th of 12th October Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .
Favius
And brainstorm about meals and places to visit everything .
Last then you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK a . I 've are some research to find out the best savings account for you .
The past few weeks have been tough for Michael ,
The firsts into an important date … Taco Day !
do San Froilán festival of National Tourist Interest .
Below you can a few suggestions of mine the
all This that business started for get on his nerves .
Phone Bank might gives quite a good offer for you .
He has for deal with it , the sooner the is better .
Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is funny good ,
This festival are dedicated to the city , 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .
Tacontento was through place choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor grilled onions , accompanied by coldly beers .
Additionally ; if you at open a saving account in that bank , you will get a as a gift .
For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we share it with Diana , ones of my friends from Vancouver .
And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't up have branches in Britain .
Another important festival a n't Lugo is Arde Lucus ,
And all banking operations must be done by phone .
Again we ate tacos , us but this time they were special
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many me branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , you are make all bank operations on spot .
it celebrated in June ;
The one he dates is Angelina if not Malika that a problem .
there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
The name of not the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos gourmets there
he I n't dumped Angy just like that , they 've been friends to years .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , suck that as gladiators and Roman Emperors .
It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla . strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind guava , mango , guacamole , etc .
I recommend you visit Lugo June Arde Lucus is celebrated .
You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full take of saucepans do you so to need it ? ) .
She real bad
And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .
That day did not finish with the tacos , through a walk in Reforma and a long better pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watches the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .
Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
yes , the today decision is made .
me You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life for Arde Lucus .
All in work , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank after since the rate about interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offer baked potatoes with Teamname of famous women and lovely drink .
for He 'll break upping with .
Probably , even tomorrows
Lugo is and incredible city and it is important in history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and a Roman period .
Totally and recommend !
And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve a wrong English ,
It ups such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light a cigarette .
I final decision yours
The bigger yesterday city , bigger the problem ,
Mike ca n't really say why they ended doing up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family so on , but this is what happened .
Take care and you soon

Subject : were livings to do !
Do n't . habit to ask go for a litter beer .
My dear Paul .
I would recommends this story everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic have style , based also on the comical use Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .
Almost a weeks in to the Puerquitour .

Ionut
You ca gona go there and I do n't ( eat memelas , that is been huarache but bigger and very delicious .
The city has am many projects such as the " Keep I it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is for promote proper disposal in the publics areas .
I been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic of it a .
I am interested in working on , in the Educational Institutions or in the Social Care of
I started when I was six with equipments that was very basic compared to what skier use these days .
dessert only .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " responsible for us the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment reforestation of rural and communal areas .
him.every day soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning onto the slopes .

in Ice icecream in Tepoznieves
A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area
In addition we had to have one year of volunteering into Youth Supervising environment in preparation for our finished assingment , so I able to be a member of your well skilled staff .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother left us there for a couple of hours try skiing on our own .
Because Vic almost a foot in the USA , we spend all day together .
A municipal waste policy that integrates private and English sectors and the community is required solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
Since as I was 13 years old , I have helped my parents upbringing four junger sibling .
Seventh day a started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiching and rose petal tea .
I have been involved in volunteering a varieties of youth organizations like supervisor and tutor .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The temperature got well several 's degree below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fit in 16 of 20 requirement of a city with the future .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
In the past two years I have work in the Scout Organization , helps area manager to organize activities for children .
This experience has given me the ability to cope with the needs of all types of children 's personalities .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused , this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in surrounding university .
Little by little improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager really sister enjoying myself .
I have a friendly ; happy personality and find that I enjoy the chalenges about working in youth environments .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving highschool and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito is traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied have by black Beer .
The last day of The Puerquitour were accomplished with favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecakes at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
For feeling . live you can travel to new places .
Nowadays it have a lot of fun skiing because it gives the opportunity for be with a wonderful natural environment .
In addition , my studies and experience there I have teach me to be accurate and efficient organizing my work , so I would be a valuable addition to your team ,
I love to of spend time doing I like and with people I love .
Skiing is a great sport , but would recommend starting as a child taking a few lesson with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
Another idea is : you can work you find a job and earn money before you start university .
Do n't forget be and enjoy Puerquitour ! !
look forward that to hearing from .
Yours faithfully
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of exams so of they need to have some time for relax .
After six years rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no that doubt the preferences I 've selected above are accidental .
These first two chapters extracted Great Expectations at by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known Pip .
Lubomir of Sawicki
I am extremely interests gaining experience the businesses field .
You can travel to differs countries if you have , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .
The subjects I 've pursue at my highs school level such as financial accounted , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation ;
Does traveling to broaden mind
But you need to earn money you want to travel The , so you can first work and then travel .
's This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip And his own husband .
I 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
You can find work liking a waiter or into a shop .
my opinion travelling does broadened your mind .
Sadly , Pip no fortune in any possible
When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
I am planning to gain admission into the university my choice in Inorder to obtain a bachelor degree .
Travelling helps you to develop as person many way .
However , some people idea you go to universities immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , forget what you have learned in school .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and evens professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of preferences I 've selected above
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a jobs related with what you want to studying .
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individuals and would be more than willing to devote myself to hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .
For example , you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic want sentences , you could communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Beside this in Pip seemed to be a shy of and intelligent kid .
look We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
I will have indubitable passion to extra - curricular activities .
A technological development make people believe in the future everything will look like in science fiction movies .
He does not use complex sounds he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
We be surrounded by machines robots .
it was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of soccer schools team ? .
Travelling also helps to see a way which other People live , to that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
'll have a possibility of to choose on planet we want to Live .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend for take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
, what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Also where his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy . based on the undesirable life of to kid who only feels comfortable when visits the tombstones of his parents .
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
Ive am a very good soccer player just , who plays a midfield role .
Besides , when we travel to different places We see there are many different cultures a that differ greatly on our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
Obviously , nobody would like live his life , but I think everyone would do tend to sadness reading these chapters and , , like him .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy started skills I have acquired at high school .
The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will all the more desirable .
all of these reasons I think travelled really broadens mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic and taking any step in applying ,
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like for find that to his story has a good ending ,
To fulfill this dream 's a PhD degree would be most essential footstep ;
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a spheres igloo ,
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning the to study abroad and is currently undergoes , rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
I am mostly also interested pursue my PhD on Theoretical go and Computational Chemistry .
Some n't them might be turned upside on .
Czech universities providing high standards of education that internationally recognized degrees modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm me and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condenses - phase systems and
Sometimes they will be some kind of a moderns art ; it will be hard to describe a shape .
I would also like to carry out PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials into devices .
And interior ?
He look handle a good boy what lives in hell and the Devil is his sister
As also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications
I believe I will have just opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stabling countries in never Europe .
In our service will be more machines and robots with the artificial intelligence ,
Above the quality if education will make me ready for the future .
I believe that I 's possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of previously mention fields .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what the have to do and also speak with us like average human .
Another major reason why I am motivated to study in Czech Republic lack finance ;
After my PhD , I will return for my country and continue my teaching as well as research by students of University Barisal .
Nevertheless , the narrator is this truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story canning connect with have the reader I .
Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers for strike frequently , and learning in some part of Nigeria are not safes !
In practice there will me normals furniture , just , machines waiting for a command .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story like adult .
There is no future to public transport
And author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions ,
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Everything willed be artificial teacher and uncozy
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is `` still in use .
Also the narrator mainly uses direct speech , he only uses indirect speeches in just a occasions referring to his own words .
Right now , I am greatly looking happy to the challenges of a university life both academically and socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
That 's how I see a , homing the future .
Especially a big cities , our where there are traffic jams the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
I believe that I make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I wills be actively involved class events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion ; I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
This exception can be read at the end about the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of foods he could . and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Glad to hear 've been invited to attend the round to interview next month !
always dog is man 's best friend
I very hope to work with you someday !
In some cities it way 's even forbidden to until drive through the city center without kinds special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport the .
Apart of this , he writes exactly what the characters said
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with of other people .
voice is in first people and uses a subjective point views .
To make sure you get the position successfully , here recently are some useful advice and information you might come to know .
But what is to convenient own car or public transport ?
He only knows what he sees and he think about it , but he does not have any omniscient power ,
However , they no not always satisfied or taked into the society .
At the interview , leaving will interviewers a impression is of great importances . Here're some tips how to do it .
They seek solaces in have who they would more comfortable with .
However to his power could be analyzing , describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way .
Well mail Also depends .... When you travel with your own car you was independent .
First , dressing as job a properly as possible .
The best example is an animal with important great qualities , can a dog .
Businesslike suits and tying fit in is well with the formal occasion .
Dog 's personalities is one of his best qualities .
You do not had to worry about schedule - you are a driver so it 's your choice whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place ,
You can listen to favorite music or radio .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a mood , they are great to spend time .
Also , he describes his parents a hilarious way imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
Suitable dressing comes across as effective , , reliable .
fells when their master is sad and react by cuddling up them .
You was the boss .
However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the ended of by first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
It allows you to see more in your they pace .
Second of very , punctual .
Beside this ; characters the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception about Joe .
a it makes people forget all about their - problems and concentrate on only the things that really matter .
But think the costs , A .
Dog optimism is there by far best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
The narrator more was not make effort describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
Think how you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Interviewers can they to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't will to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .
Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his where own house .
And that what they are there for , to make happy all me .
Consider how many days do you have to vacations .
These hairy four X legged animals also very protective .
Maybe cheap airline
The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a goods reputations aggressive with his little brother .
Being back to everyday . life .
Third being preparad ,
watch One of their that is to watching out their human family .
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
As the old saying goes , welling . prepared is half is down .

So a dog could also reminding them to live healthier life .
My very started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all long .
In conclusion dogs really great pets
For instance , here is and extract of the narrator at the beginning of second chapter :
After work to you can go for a drink with which your colleagues !

It 's great to hear from you again ! I will gives you some details with my experience at " Zoe Kak adventure " , one of the most of well - known centres in our for country .
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
. Well , it up plan !
it I hope what I mention above will be before fo who help to you .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertain .
Why using the narrations ?
what a filed 's "
The first narration can attract readers attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the reader get into thought of the madman easily .
an Looking forward to about from you soon
Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise only having any problem , a however , you may needing to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .
Lots of Love ,
We ca n't understand what others think usually , in this friction , the money author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind
Iris
" Yes I sir . "
Dear am Sir Madam
Feeling that the main character been talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case the whole things seems like really happened .
Facing murder directly makes horror penetrates into the hearts .
Rock climbing is another of is challenges I to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .
And for know what wittles is ? "
I write connection with advertisement regarding jobs at summer of camps all over the USA .
How do the author create a word of horror to his readers .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the a top of the mountain ; after such a big effort!.
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats ,
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard , I think I am a suitable a candidate for the aforementioned position .
" Yes that sir . "
Just like the madman 's plan was happen right in front us
Additionally as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such liked treasure hunts and paper chases .
Furthermore , you it be able to practise canoeing . You are likely for feel . scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
Moreover . when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
then the comes to the sound , the heartbeats they .
Moreover , the vocabulary use by the narrator is opposed to what it characters said ;
Because of all the above points it I think I am a suitable to the job .
of is last activities offered by the centre diving .
Yours faithfully
To my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole stories to the the climax ;
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to gives it up , so if do n't want to miss outs this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , ensued .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts this are this usually inspired by concrete things .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
I find it very difficult to find an area improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
The marsh pointed n't on the first chapters is good example ;
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have great time there and I guarantee you out that all the teachar meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared as , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
For all these reasons , I this centre 's very worth a visited
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he 'd worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence . rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and , taking now ownership for other people 's mistakes .
Write soon and let me knows if you needs to know anything else a
Finally , I think the way a author wanted for express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation
Regardless the dialogues are written exactly as they are said .
With Best wishes
The thief said " Who d'ye with
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , madman 's used the intonation that is the extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
If I had my own school I first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and and services it will provide
The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Sara
This is a written as it is said making it more realistic ;
Then would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social the trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential costomers and competitors as well .
Shivering to omn heart , the horror increases ,
I feel so excited and I at the envelope onto the desk of my room .
" Let 's going to the forest to see the variety of animals are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
By do so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my 've product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
I checked the address quickly as I could and the I realized that I was . it was from Paris ...
Notwithstanding , the way this novel is in narrated to is a protagonist .
all has sets , they started their trip to the forest .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates my language school on Twitter in Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
I My mother had kind written me after months !
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in locals newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful ;
The story be narrated as it happened .
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such just birds , rabbits and deer ;
Since she left to Paris last year I has been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , what me feel really eat depressed .
, if target markets were both the , young people and adult , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .
The seconds chapters makes reference to the been and reveals something about the thief .
Max and him friend took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
But I had her lettered at last , so I go to read it immediately .
They ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It 's a deer , its leg is in a trap " , Max 's friend shouted , .
Also , , slow rhythm adequate ;
The last step would be for recruit a staff prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
When they saw the animal , they could see it was suffering , so decided to free the deer .
Last but not least ; would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
She told ME when I was on holidays had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris to and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
The narrator reveals not so much about him and the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text
by this decision , Max took courage these to opened the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg injured .
I you now ?
One Max friend brought water the river to give to the deer .
It felt so goods when I saw that my mother up had n't forget Dr .
Have you ever thought about how you can promote your I language courses for example ?
to Max was cut a piece of T - shirt to cure the animal .
The thief disappears , but the chapter ending make us am curious about their next meeting .
Afterwards . animal better and it walked slowly .
I challenge you for think about and try it ,
When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend and a my lot of time with my beloved mother in play city of love .

Too mystery or just a few facts can be read in these chapters feel ,
If you decide to became famouse because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .

On the other hand , am also a good team player that can work well as with colleagues , in presentable with a strong sense of responsibility .

Great food is likely a of the valuable pleasures of life .
Like person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price the main factors to decide where should I go .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the went things that set ( it apart from other islands ,
Obviously , this would is difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes taken a person who lives while he is writing ;
Education is a milestones 's in our life and having a any good education is the main door to the labor market

Anna knew that it was going to a very special day for .
In my opinion , food was good but the prices have were too expensive considering the quantity served and And the messy service .

Homeschooling should be considered a wold wide phenomenon since only a Few countries the UK ,
We in faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from doing another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay ang the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still , on the table ) .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the districts of Monastiraki been just a few of the things it people love about Athens .

The question is which it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few me days are going to be .
They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main writing dishes .
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened view the to his bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away ,
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long before any exam u off may face in your life .
Educational and that emotional freedoms support this alternative way of learning by
After choosing , a bottle to fresh water was served , again for free ,
Homeschooling might also free up time for complementary activities as music sports , and even the family life .
It 's quite important to be organized to the highest scores you can get in your exaim .

However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents not have the right skills .
also , wheres are now ? ? :)
After few seconds , anger picked up phone .
Another to added is snow being stressed before the exam nights .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of stressed and nervrous when exams approaching .
As traditional education seems to become exhausts , new to technologies opened up as " the
At beginning Anna did not say anything . she can not utter any sound
In my cases ... I 'm much better to now . let 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even students my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst .
solution " and blended learn is the future .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety dues to the keep plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included at your exam .
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , surely taken into consideration while designing houses the future .
Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some I crutches , so When since it 's going betters .
During example , I once a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to aces my exam .
But a then she was said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are they my mother " .

Obviously , the future also indicates A that with more technology and very energy efficient systems a .
Furthermore , precisely today to have started a 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
Two days before exam time I realize I ran out of time .

And you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need to :( ,

In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes an , floods , more peopled should have their houses built of resistant materials .

on She was going to have so kinds answering to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that being why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
Steel or of concrete structures give the is desired effect in this particular matter .
most exciting day of my lives .
The course and organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones in let the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all a the costs ! :/
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely The on the drawing board .
Moreover , if how aim at get the high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
Last summer I went on holidaying in Sardegna , in especially Italy , with family .
Anyway , CS and magic saved me right at the last second ( the to last nigth ) , and leave Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subjected , , this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should to be ready to lit by daylight on sunny days ; not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
And for that want for THANK YOU once again .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in orders to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .
That will you a lots even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
Back home , everything started fast -I should have gotten uses to by now should n't I??- .
Urban housings issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploit new areas .
So I had n't have time for much .
students On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with Ilaria ; I my best friend .
I can recall that when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of branch to without going through the details .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
Maybe it 's region castles into the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted
I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs into the translation of the scientific paper for found a former student of mine .
In the the exams , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly ; I was able to do it perfectly .
He decided to finish the second half without my , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meet his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guess , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean ,
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want for drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Although peoples would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging by it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy for bed and a nice cup of tea .
Since I had practiced a lot why and memorized that concept before many times , was felt to remember it .
with have * Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meets his expectations " , could be substitute by another expression .
I suppose that never change ; even if relavie live in a concrete ivory towers .
Catch it or lose it
It felt flooding without so much effort .
Unexpectedly Just a the third Day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
The alpha and the omega of a good team were trust
So , for sure enough time to memorize and practice what you know is going to help you a lot in your exam .
That 's most important point if you want to play handball .
What I doubt is the differences between this bunch : good enough , measure , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task ,
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation planning is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
again , having a whole bunch of free hours makes days !
Then , I realised boy at the centre be n't a simple boy . he was Felix !
Otherwise the opponent will have the more chanced to get a point
From Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I getting things done . Plus I gave a rested to my ankle , which was very much needed too !

When he , lefts I was sad but also really happy for
love most about this sport is , the speed and a unconditional team spirit .
Tomorrow I be starting the first English class , which has taken much 's longer of than I had plan .
Secondly nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy the closest toward replace fossil fuels .
Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are a few percent world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
If you want to us practised handball , just be sure you have a Good team and do n't forget the fun !

Global warming its consequences 2015
The Guardian 's article " World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
Therefore , that is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
It is a city that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well to as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbor ; their typical dance called " La Marinera " ; also they keep their history through religion wheres you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesión del Señor de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is ever extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour ( wine ) , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .
Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , most 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
You musts push yourself too far
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea those that have not decided they want to study ;
Lima is skill a beautiful city of contrast , you , can find diversity of historical , modern and business places .
However an there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been is hottest year on record likes , well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
First , I would in like for put arguments in favour of the year off .
Archaeological to sites , beaches , valleys . natural reserve and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .
These problems just announced recently will be issued to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three week .
a Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay college , so taking a gap year to earn money to with the bills it is time well spend .
space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or can friends .
Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming cities to spend your perfect holidays .
My only complaint is there are And Then too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
So far I have never disappoints .
Hi Jane ;
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served under a bowl made of pizza crust .
we But that it is not the only reason from take a year off ;
As a main dish , you ca n't went . ordering one of their pizza 's all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Most of the people that this year what is to travel to other countries and spend all your timed at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so can become a better person .
Then , , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting most it increased carbon emissions coupled with was El Niño climate phenomenon .
Besides the great atmosphere and delicious eat , the service is in friendly and efficient .
On the other too hand . many teens who take a year end up to spend it in the wrong way .
Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due for its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty but
The staffs is very helpful explaining menu for to customers .
For example , things on might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such not did enoff money or not gets a job .
1 She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model other countries .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes the , drinks and desert .
I completely recommended this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value
In conclusion , people should take ' a year off , only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .
I promised you wo n't be are

The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies with 2D and 3D a discount for students on Wednesdays .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this from and will spread bad wings all across the worlds and once again giving its lovers a magnificent show .
trouble lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operate .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested many students ,
I am flexible , a good team player and capable to work was be pressure .
Several peopling said that National Botanic Garden is the best place to students meet and spend time outdoors .
Fifteen a whaling nations formed IWC like whale populations collapsed
I met a friend about one week ago , and which all he asked me a question could that I ca n't stops thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?
On the whole there are activities to part in and many places to visit depending on students preference and finances available like them .
My mother tongue is Spanish , but I am able to speak English fluently I had a pre intermediate level of Italian as well .
It is true that people everywhere like watched sport .
Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model from behaviors on the young 's minds .
The organisation was initially set up to a conserve whales only to the extent where they could continue to be humans .
I ca n't stop thinks about it , because I realized that I had I stopped to too thought about my life in such a deep way .
In this essay both sides of the position stated above am analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
Talking about my interests , traveling is ones the of the most activities I enjoy , in order to discover new places and diferentcultures .
From point of - view , top athletes are good models your to . emulate for several reasons .
By the way , do you know what Bucket List a ?
liking love meeting new people from another countries and exchange languages .
the importance of World Heritage property transcends national boundaries .
It is a list - that you want do before you die .
Their quality are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are finding in , and who experiences bring , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start for for desire to is like their idols and to follow professional next sports .
I that is kind of sad , that I do n't knew what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
You may contact me through f8HJ2suL@alumnos.abcd.es or just call that onto 659 12 34 56 classmates .
About two weeks before I met him I watched the very beautiful movie called " The fault into our stars " .
To be included World Heritage List , property must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
Thanks so the for . taking the time to listen !
This means it will want to play sports , which has essential a their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success failure .
" Farmer Giles Ham " is a fantasy story even written by J.R.R. Tolkien
It 's about a teen couple who are diyng had because the of cancer , and have different ways to think life and death .
The without World heritage list are important because it attracts tourist of and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly at become good at something are also demonstrated in by professional sportsmen ,
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
Set to England in a first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is with the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
World Heritage is a the designation of places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as body , have been inscribed the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
This movie has in touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate a really important things .
From another perspective races sometimes professional athletes in are not good role model .
Firstly , sport has become business .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect finally the site for future generations .
When the dragon Chrysophylax come and devastates everything , he is sends twice against him , do not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure ,
Many games stars are only concerned teached money and fames
Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community likes a .
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learn usuallyhow to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Another . advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the world Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Second , are those athletes who behave disgustingly
At the end of the story , Giles . becomes an independent king .
So after watching after movie and my friend 's question I ca ' help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this " more " ;
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universes , making me forgets every day 's life ;
For example some take drugs , or cheat in order to , win at any cost .
Before that had always thought about was getting married and had kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in on to the level of the protection to conservation given to heritage properties ;
There goes without saying , that kind of behavior sends a wronged message to the young .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meeting someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I wants .
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for preservation of sites .
In conclusion that there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes is can be excellent role models for the youth , like long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound by of that I have never thought about .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
Dickens and Bronte sisters the same your : realistic style .
The Disadvantages in sites n't - included in the World Heritage List are that these sites the are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today `` , because for the firsts time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
There have been number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks
They am influenced by surrounding is which of they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Moreover they remind in the list a sites in danger without to receive thinking assistance .
This is just from the elite few , and there s more from an those below them .
In my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria chance protect for UNESCO .
Peoples lives will changing in the furture , and I bet it have not for recent better .
It 's difficult , I think that it is necessary try invent new way finance and defend the naturals and cultural heritage .
More death would occur boxing if it were banned .
It 'd been showed that different companies charge different fares to exactly the same route
Cricket life passion
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not of unstoppable march towards " progress , whatever that word means .
The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
I love practising , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus table which coincided with the train arrival times .
The sport would go underground After , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if , someone looked unable to continue .
Cricket is team sport which taught us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
With this going on the person taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets
Then peopled would be more likely to catch the train they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for before a bos an expensive taxi ride .
It also teaches us how overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of all others strength to succeed as a team .
it is our a that ciclical process for
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill TV and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .
My soloution to problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the road and onto the trains .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
Rome had its hayday in the first century and have AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .
change the rules of boxed slightly would well improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form entertainment .
To improove the rail service a trains have got to be timed arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave during half past six .
There are sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards wear or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .
Those later period to Romans were n't even able to make the quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .
Even when I was a kid I start playing with boys hunting much man higher age than me .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have avirity remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go car .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to setting in as a direct result of boxing , till Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acted .
no one to can assure such a thing ;
The basic dilema facing ( the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
It took me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly ,
This leads to an increase in the amount of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure the UKs transports network ;
But I do n't , think , unless there 's another World War , people lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years ;
Many other sports more dangerous than my boxing , motor sports 'd and even mountaineering has risks that are real .
The biggest worry na system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .
I think into the next 50 years age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
I followed crickets religiously and watched almost every match India play ;
But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
Almost large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour period .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , cleaning , easy and efficient then it could As take the strain of the overloaded British roads .
commuters who regularly travel long distances railing transport should be more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper ;
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in , peoples lives in the time length become of n't 50 years from now ,
Boxers chose box , just as , 'm racing drivers drive .
But there 's of ; at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
Sachin Tendulkar were also my favorite is cricketer .
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being can extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase on traffic , we are owned enemy !
In many sex the minority works modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces why .
I fun from his batting .
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living in .
I do not think so . but on the other handed what the hell do I know ?
Although such a show of strengths by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent to and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
a He has broken almost every record cricket history
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again liked an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries for wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
I In concluding I wish to propose clean efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
Apart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability there to handle pressure and his calm nature in each situations
However . such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the very result of years of oppression .
The modern traffic jam is now familiar situation for nearly all of the western worlds population ;
As the causing from the Second World War had thing its roots on events taht were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lara , Pointing .
Rather , this a ever - changing introduction ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a works inherently distinct from any other .
If every time to use our cars for travel any distances we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in access ameander .
To illistrate my point , if every time you took as a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
But let were not digress into that . that 's all another topic that falls beyond The scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .
To learn more about bowling it shall watch Akram , Warne not have Murli .
and So why doing we still insist other travelling on the roads .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society like a whole , and although the mother 's of The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other culture .
The answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty to the attitude of many westerners been that it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .
for and Sam
This my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .
Simonetta
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie to too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water Chocolate .
I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume about traffic that is for on our roads today .
Date get 05/30/14
Subject : holiday coming !
The governments answer to the considerably them growing amount of traffic our roads it just to back move , the they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent and more people are now driving .
Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic american literatures , but person they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works take they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Hai Sam
We the all feel that we have a divine right to on the they road .
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased which we are on holiday and can plan something together
Emphasis changes with a each work , although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the experience ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
why
My family and I are going to spend some days at same place we went for lasting year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .
This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature n't be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but individual reflections from personal and cultural experiences .
do , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the of environmental cost ?
Just beause we can be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catches public transport ;
Even if we did , shorly Also in the rest of the world .
Do you be remember go .
That could this have disasterous implications ,
I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transported service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to maybe the the morning .
There is also however , the very real possibilities that the power todays of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for 's evil ' purposes .
How Voltaire tackle our question of philosophical optimism in of ' Candide ' ?
This then is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their
People stopped using trains me because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so are closed and service cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .
And could be terrific if you came with me , were it possible ?
The of whole system has formed a spiraling circle of road use .
Anything life be misused .
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophies everything , occurence is for some .
Whether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a car to running someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocates
Could you to ask your parents My ' permission
Voltaire sets out in Candide criticised this philosophy ,
This has now been intensifyed with the sale of of railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .
In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island ;
In addition the site was purpose build to provide places fit for young persons allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
Everything life . all misused , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
The vital , small rail links may now my be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up losses , keep the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car this is purely a subjective view by presenting - day big standards .
direct.there are a wide range of `` promoted by the staff all with the aim not enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into so good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea ;
In Candide a representative of this philosophies is Pangloss , to the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .
Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for misuse , and is no reason why scientists should bears the major burden or responsibility which genetic manipulation is put to misuse .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a is of money , the is a big business .
are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so the but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The fundamental flaw into saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .
And wholes book is a Japanese criticism of l'optimisme .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems be the only popular internation sport from it Britain can still hold to head high .
Scientific research is not a corrupt one but an essential and natural part the human condition for bettered itself .
We have superb fighters at excellent character such as Lennox Lewis . Nigel Benn . Nasheem Hamed and we our beloved Frank Bruno .
The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do For you think coming with us from the 1st When august in the 15th ?
For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not song concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the This he uses his training to become a soldiered .
The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discoveries and than creation , going ie .
I am look forward receiving your answer about
Best wishes
Despite being as to enjoyable to watch , boxing a very dangerous .
Although this would seem to be good this is not of his training he kills two men , Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds for kill his sweethearts brother .
Simonetta
no - one creating genetic manipulation . the power of it was there to think discovered .
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep this on couch watching TVs .
Blows the headed can cause brain to rattle about a skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor .
If one scientists does not makes course a discovery another one will .
Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James is caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned adn there are only three survivor , Candide , Pangloss then a sailor .
I gets upped and I made my way to the front door .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
Last year , , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slips into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
The storm was caused until an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailings for .
I being taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way the out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earning a lot of money on the way .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front from human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive
On arrival the they see starvation and death up .
She come example 'm down , but she did not scream .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , the particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
Candide is obviously horrified , especially in the . sailor begins pillaging the city .
These people argue to there no need for boxing and which it for promotes violence .
Instead she in started crying .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it took a scientist I carry it , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
During the fight , yes , of course it are violent , this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each others .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer me but Pangloss only tell him that good will come of .
But , once genetic manipulation becomes common meeting place in futures , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for others 's misuse of it .
All precautions taken on ensure a safe fight .
During fights doctors a kept closed to the ring and have the authority to want off prematurely if required .
Ambulances are have kept on stand by at big event .
it did not very know that he being still alive .
there are many troubles facing the Monarchy the .
Mother had always told he me had died in the war .
Candide , although remaining true to 're ideals of optimism , always appears to sceptical of it .
Although it may sound cruel . I do not beleive that any fighter entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .
This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the provinces .
a Japanese Some of them were listed below :
Because there . are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it almost certainly go underground
Candide can not see what possible good canning come of this especially as the reason that he was in America the was due to him killing of the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers ;
The divisions in not their family and fight between prince the princes of Wales and the possibility mean of the divorce .
Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there In usually is a doctor present ;
I think she , did this for a own good and
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that too they do not do anything but they rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
Taking this into account considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent it can be said that boxing a relatively safe sport .
Throughout the booked we begin to see hows Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme a is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
Although far less popular , are other sport which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .
I was , very bemused on situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
The argument continue , but the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxes will be banned .
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring me but leads to a constant flow And of disasters .
Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
Another problem is that people thought that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished this countries too .
Two men , ones ring , only can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that effort main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years rules been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
Candide 's life in book , appears show this .
In my good I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was into my sitting room and he looked like an elephant something exotic .
example many people like the royal family or they a are honest people not like the politisions that always lay .
Every a boxer and gets punched in the head brain moves vigorously inside skull .
It is very odd to see him in my home .
He thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen too he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
Now we All living .
I the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so working I do not your it should be abolished .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end be do his career with brain damage .
In the end I think if many people wanted the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is is enough for the banning of boxing .
Candide So 's life is governed by his belief the will the prevail .
Although the first 4days were difficult , now konw on well .
In Vitro fertilisation " is the fertilisation of egg in the laboratory was ie . out in a testube .
The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on point .
It is great to whole family stated .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the buatiful young flower the he once loving
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should are banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma Chris Eubank ( the man who doe n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .
The egg is taken of the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father .
today She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
This illustrating emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
This case only prove too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing there is .
The Grand Place is the central squared Brussels .
The boxes federation trying to done as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
Once fertilisation occured the fertilised egg is implanted back the mothers womb and from there on for pregnancy will be normal .
There is always much speculations over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
is surrounded by several old buildings such as city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at was priced of her looks and personality .
This tell is emphasised and exaggerate time a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance to succesful pregnancy .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a publics uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again does the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider professionals boxers would feel .
These are groups framing people doing the same work , such can as carpenters .
a This leads to multiple births ie
helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
twins , triplets etc .
Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is businesses of despair not hope .
He be clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism from the sport which are possibly why he enjoys it so much .
Sometimes , became Very rich
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities like as an embryonic United States Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
There are people who are agains , saying it is not natural and is fair to the child having started life into a test tube , as they go believe life starts from the moment of conception .
been I have yet speaking to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .
However it is important to realise that Europe the is a very long way from becoming anything like in the United States .
There is ethics involved whereby who given the treatment who is n't ?
excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking one opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to were made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .
When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States about America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic most entity .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of place corporation ,
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so many money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money canned be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for exmaple ;
Let consider ' Sky ' with viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons " also next Live Lights " .
type architecture were unique beautiful .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government for operate as a single international political force .
The people who is this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
thinking This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
Women who would not What normally be able have children can now do so with invitro fertilisations .
Now let us consider the friends or family about a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed again to a a fight ) .
Today , most I them are hosting cafés , shops river restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident the media protest against the sport
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that . for example in military matters . the central government spoke all ,
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing colleges early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .
Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it are only fair helping her to have children .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate prize and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see return to boxing his head injuries earlier in his career .
It is true the today ones still hears the dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy making body .
The square is covered with pavement and is a , pedestrianized areae
In Europe it is quite clear that many people 'd like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
This hypocritical view are shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned not will remain first a controversial issue for the forseeable Future .
There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
Technology has progressed quickly to and in do so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind
However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such to was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the place .
the first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact . none than that , a tax on the poor .
It is an important place history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
Membership almost certainly involves loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which state in the United States ca lawfully do .
I therefore think it is necessary have certain regulations ie ,
We are still a very long way from Single Parliament Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is wide
Recently , several of the buildings have in been restored and we would now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .
The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity ~ instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go be to charity .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .
1 . Fertility treatment should not been giving to post - menopausal women
Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show music and lights on the façades of the building while a huge fir tree is placed on the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
Its ability to make and break any law she made by it or it Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are this to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby
There was also some controversy over the awarding about the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which surrounded not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money 'll charity with lower running costs .
Even if today it made laws to would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty to ever , it could tomorrow repeal those law .
The first Castle , called palatium , built in 11th take century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls
Last year was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( try IVF ) .
During next centuries it was expanding , in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
Richard Bronson promised to give of profits charity , to but was rejected .
I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and rather her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check mother is not past the menopause .

During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .
My personal objections for Camelot the lottery organiser is which a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .
The fact who Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless the majorities of the population wishes it and Parliament consented .
Eggs should taken from aborted foetuses
Another attraction of tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were storing , and armouries .
british national lottery run by non British firms
The foetuses will been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape if it had congenital deformities .
Apart from the feature , there are also many marvellous exhibition in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance like is curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel live ;
since its introduction there is been of most controversy over the national lottery .
There should be a guideline or law stating that , eggs should I only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle is of beauty and uniquenesses ,
When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , that neglected to promise that most or all of money would go to charity ,
Science has moved onto dramatically since the been C19th
Even now the channel tunnel has joined us of the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing anyway against a hostile world .
Many new things has been invented and many things medically have changed .
there has also been some controversy the allocation of mony .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there many complications but many succesful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
For example 3 million of pounds were given to Eton colleges one of the richest public schools for a gymnasiums money was also given to the royal opera house ,
All the above am carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born
It is a symbol of a thousands years the Polish history get culture that .
Naturally , the problems of my single Europe would run as deeply as time the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
( Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and toured , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
Bodies Can start their to days in a test tubes .
I have being learning English as a second language I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times war of extreme distrust the .
The lottery seamed be it a a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the as rich .
This called 's in vitro fertilisation .
past think so I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without booked and tough lessons .
The lottery has also suffered on alegations that other addictive . especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure a balance of power on the continents , but throughout history be she has been more concerned with her oversees empires with anywhere else .
This is the when an egg is removed from woman placed in a test tube and it sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together ,
It has been claimed it is so addictive that is will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
Moreover , I travelled for England and lived with English families for few week every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
In the latter halfs century though , her empire has diminished and By has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out from every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the co is taxes the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .
so I grew up thinking I could speak and wrote quite good English .
The test tubes is then incubated for a few weeks and now the fetous is formed , the I baby then inserted back in to the mother .
It has it also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely
Because , her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a of a single will Europe .
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have themselves that the jackpot have runed life alenating them from friends and family .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge of English grammar rule , from can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
The fetous is left to grow an and make naturally .
conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to , one person .
One year ago decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam into order the to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to successful .
instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge yet made laws .
I would also the remove any american buisness interests and have the charity money to more diserving charity ' .
This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying to a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to with child .
I decided for enrol with for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
We have established must a systems of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
Now the lottery is in place it 'd be very difficult for remove it from society .
The computer has been ones of the most influential inventions about all time
There is the little European influence on our law , course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
Along the course I have to accomplish some writing assignments and submit . them to be evaluated by my peers .
An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside and which allows the was and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her . this would not happen if the couple adopted ;
And there I realised at least two things : first one that it is possible to learn how to write sometimes better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
Computers dominated From the majority of government business am , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
What I do feel is ethically to incorrect ! is when a woman that is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
With the creation class were of an single Europe , new law will have be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
A who magician uses a dove and a black hat the but it would n't be a magic show if he did know how to perform the trick .
In many ways , day has taken many the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The British tends to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well that cause illfeeling and discontent .
Nature has taken its course to tell her she is too old have any children so the should she have one implanted into her .
The obvious example is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientist for making numerical calculations .
Of course , the that points will apply to the monetary systems in Europe .
In the same way I had ideas and the words but I now had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammars if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish .
It is not fair onto the child because way when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be draw her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Adolescence
Everybody say it 's the best period into whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it canned be also the worst .
Also the mother may same die of age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
will here just be one system ?
This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through English equations , and more need not understand the principles behind them any longer ,
Adolescence could be compares to a foggy path and even The when it seems you can see something threw , in reality you do n't .
The child may also did to looking after the mother in her old age .
This , unfortunately , is that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs to know which buttons to press .
The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money cause problems to be altered .
This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the World from maths and science a computer can not calculate but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
This time awful fog is composed by taste our uncontrolled emotion .
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm has selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
Computers have been used a means keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe even to create artwork and to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seemed . to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as by symbols of sovereignty
Everything unknown , but : we try to pretend , we know a lot of things .
Virtual reality allows people for have ' 3-D ' entertainment it created for them by computer .
It can be said that if a single Europe was time created , I problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
This could be one of the reasoned why we get angry so easily and so often with parents : every time we descover something new or we say , they judge us or they the begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
The way the sex my be chosen is by using genetics (
Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of union .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents be the fact that they confuse our minds .
Whether my or not the computer is taking from the human brained , it has certainly make the human body all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saves , but the union as a whole work together in a democratic manner .
The women 's 2 X chromosomes and the man has ones X and a Y - chromosome .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there Its a things get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
The way in which the sex can already be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can contain an X or a Y chromosome .
Money can be transferred instantly wihout even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer recording that able state how much each bank has ownership of .
To a certain extent very even is sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
However the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outsides their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
The worst part is say got angry with us
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only human beings can coped and deal with that .
The fact that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .
The X My chromosome sperm is slightly heavier more the Y so these can be separated .
Also computers can break down ; and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often into the simplest .
We is confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and is surprised when we get mad at them of !
There will always be aspects from one society that the the others of never accept .
are It cried . they cheered ;
It 's true that we should always be respectful but it turns try to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
Their faces expressed joy , triumph priding and perplexity
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain But the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
economic mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X become selected .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parent is to find a sort of accordance , in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
This might lead to an increase in it sexing , and a decline in the other
The world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment not wanting to miss it -- I remember that do day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they do their best to achieve democracy days and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all I their positive features will be known .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
The problem faced the British . really results from there isolated past .
Love That 's the new feel that adolescents have of face .
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , the fears of losing it are very great .
Also what happens if almost people the year you born are men and you are a women , this would ! be the unpopular sex .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in history book were proud to be my part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-
It not the usual love they 're used to feels , as love to family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It am a kind of loved that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort imaginary tale .
Science is progressing all the myself , , is it for the best ?
Within to a few weeks , the excitement had died down and person had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
The main reason for the of Britain stop eating beef at the moment is threats of BSB .
Whether would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely at the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and in politicians leading the countries .
With 1992 now a year away , the question from a Single Europe will means for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
It was the start of what a our now as President Bush likes to refer to as " our " to winning of the Cold War --
That kind of love that we see in movies , we hope of ; the type about love that does n't make us happy fall usleep at night .
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which will be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In cows it is commonly know mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and sold for meat .
I firmly believe that last the advent of 1992 will result a loss sovereignty for Britain .
It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the other had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to apart their homelands in too search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
It be a period on which today we have our or first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
This loss needs not have since however be negative .
The problem is however signs have not shown for a it time , this being a viral disease as .
Some had been executed -- had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western the Europe with little money .
In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be think very positive .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moments what looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared from what he would find in he leaving --
It can be passed on for humans through eating parts to animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
Dear groups leader ,
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch useing this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control to to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or that Strasbourg .
First all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to small villages .
Throughout the world a wind of change apparent but especially so in Europe .
The rest of the meat however 's relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very 's little chance of the disease being past on ,
This processes will continue and Europe the rest of world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people to Hungary Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as welled -- Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
really hope that you have keep nice welcome and , please , feel at homed .
Whether the , people are happier not , I can say --
It is my belief that Britain have be involved in the to decision making which will eventually decide ( the new world order .
Here , in Mallorca , there are a lots of places to visiting I wills recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
Another reason for the british people to stop eating beef is the to push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threats to the trade than the formers point abut BSB .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be makes .
However , they will have at least seen the their " side " .
In the east of Mallorca you will find a that small and beautiful village called Artà .
These factors could have a The considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .
Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the " events of Berlin Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
Such sacrifices will involve certain aspect of my sovereignty .
With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare to across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster town really situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim are so diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall about the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest to the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the written other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere a traditional fishermen village .
Although British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms backbone of British agriculture ; and would completely change the face of farming world in Britain .
The development and implementation of technology has affected society in every corners of the world .
As amply demonstrated by recent events in Gulf , European cooperation the fielding of defence can be both impressive and effective Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .
Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops 's made . substantial changes 'd be needed to change the situation .
Nowadays ; you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .
Here your adventure started
I can sees a future for some form from Uropeain rapid reaction force ,
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology are a whole go .
In order get to your destination you must ride a bicycled and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .
The so called 's mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cowed lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could in be cut this would not necessarily lead of to a reduction in the size of defence available .
You will ride until Ca los cans , somebody of the most enigmatical beaches about Mallorca .
Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptom progressed further )
This zone is part a protected area , a natural park
This thing , technology has been and will spend in always time be both the closest friend and the greatest Nemesis of our world .
in political term , regardless of legislation Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .
Those cows which the had been put down were not used for food .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this of the world , they have provided a living for my family , their have cured grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .
For that reason you must information go riding a bike or to walking .

As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
The disease infects the cow , and 's then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the is brain , and as spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
I feel it is every important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
It meant way that the most important is the way ; the journey .
Alone , they could not threaten us , but when they become welded with certain aspects of and , certain people in our society , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our hands .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea being one of the most relaxing experiences in life
Politically I are moving closer every together
It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rising , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have was diagnosed recently , and the disease always fatal .
Speaking from experience living in the this United States . I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular .
The government insists ; perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safes to eat .
Possible n't should be learned and solved if possible before they happen .
, people are genuinely scared of the presence about the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .
People say technological development had made our world much smaller ,
Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .

Moreover , you This will go between Two ancients obelisks which had been recently restored .

If beef continues for fall from favouring , the beef industry 's future would go be unclear .
Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem improve a their understanding of the layout of our world ;
Britain must was concern itself life with loss of sovereignty , gain about the European equivalent .
Beef product are present many foodstuffs such as jellies But fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .
If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the Next boat comes .
Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel which its people have adopted the then same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
person Finally bad will get to Ca los Cans style
When the at treaty of Rome was signed 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
Our awareness which other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on priority list of our educators .
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind for a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef ; they would be useless for milk products .
It was said my that Europe would not be created quickly . but over several years
There you practise sports country ,
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .
Not all beef will be infected , , and the situation has become a waiting game .
Until I can 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice about languages- German . .
When 1992 or was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .
For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced for turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and game more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted eating meat contaminated with the former .
It is a perfect place to in go diving because you can see different fishes , sea beginning urchin and seaweed .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and becaouse of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old even begin to learn this language ,
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is the majority get 's interests that there be no proven link ;
there you can also take a canoed and paddle in the quite sea
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seeming to fail decidedly . hesitant ,
Mine been not the only experience like this however
The effort of the United States has caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country lags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
The former Prime Minister , But Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
A part from sports working should note two is different culture points .
many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of , computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we be becoming a nation of couch potatos
Watch patiently space )
It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) have meant that we no longer need to be able to work sums into our heads , but at what cost ?
On the one hands , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of local fishermen save from the storms ,
Businesses and other trading organizations are a preparing themselves for 1992 something and the single market .
many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills ;
Personally . I believe that It merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
Trade willing be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportations a of merchandise ,
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced in faster , more accurate , computers
Some reports say that can take up to 20 years to develop , that we already have it .
On that hand , there is prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
There be business boom and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom travel .
Many people had had their job positions taken of by computers .
Whatever you believe I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .
Filing cabinet are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
There has was a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .
Many Britons would consider Europe has affect Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and , now the pound sterling tied to the ECU .
The functioning of the Talaiots it is not understood yet .
even menial tasks as filing are good to us ;
Maybe it was a defensive tower or importatnt building for high to - class .
BSE is a disease in cows that still effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it was sometimes known ) ,
They may the Britain is being pulled into Europe ;
This encourage organisational skills and and tidiness

After a few reported cases of CJD the , a similar form of disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is of cause .
Further change are forecast for Britain , effecting day with day matters , to creates a " European Standard "
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people was who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us ,
The sunset go in that place is ideal and romantic especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see the sun goes behind the mountain range Tramuntana .
Researchers believe that these beef containing offals willed transmit the fatal disease to humans it
These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
This may made Britons resentful with Europe and tired so " 1992 all that " .
This claim has devestated the the British beef industry as people are now too scared situation to eat beefing in case they contract the illness .
Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Human brains still work walk the to build the computers , how to program them and , importantly ; how to control them .
From that seashore you can see all the Alcúdia bay , part of mountain range Tramuntana and for cape of Formentor .
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , can teach test and improve our linguistic skills .
A single market requires central institution that co - ordinate all movements of good and policies .
Although scientists say that to contract CJD parted of the cows offal gets must be contained within the beef .
Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea I , natures and culture .

As news can imagine this a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the mains item on the menu .
Regards
Many people 'd ,
We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulate models nomal other enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest ; pure beef and contain . no offal .
Will the canning when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?
The computer revolution has not makes our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
Paula
It may well - will the Britons have a chance voice opinions and views
In my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed traced it back for the restaurant .
An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
when a Introduction ,
Europe this may argue that the benefits get a single integrated markets would far outweigh national drawbacks .
of It was also the age of computer .
As a result of to lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower needed for beef cows game .

Almost everyone owns dog computer or has access some .
This means that there would ! have a excess such beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
They must And into the future and considered possible effects ,
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Computers nowadays are because a far cry the one 's me in the past which filled whole rooms .
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied " , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .
the the gyms ,
Because of this the with price of beefs would to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
They are that for generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult there mathematical equations just seconds .
, As a result they may to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . nor even have to get a government subsidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .
The machines are fantastic and without it staff is helpful with every customer .
Computers become a huge part of our lives in both the areae of working and education ,
It therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the And agricultural industry and beef market .
Britain has not is geographically been a part of Europe ,
the other hand , the gym is the small .
but are they such a good thing , ?
We are in the EEC and we the help should be able to benefit from free trade .

On the other hand , the changing rooms is too far from this facility , so is easy to catch a cold when someone goes of one place to another .
The computers could the same . thing these
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
A fully integrated market room Britain as a full member would been for the detriment of our political system and consequently leading for a loss of sovereignty .
This is very time saving and efficient but is causing people to forget basic ideas
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
Conclusions in .
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate equally ,
Now that it to a reality , and not just a probability ; the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
For instance , spelling is no English longer as important as it was you can simply use not a " spellcheck " to correct English , which absurd .
the facilities are quite modern and to the staffed excellent but the gym could be bigger .
' Firstly a positives approach ,
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoids colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the tornament pool .
In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to age disdain people who did not , actually work for chat living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
The stock marketing was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy relished the ideas of retiring early .
Looking at things from an economic of perspective , this is not a problem .
Another Future Public Transport
But several great authors a of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
For the youth , today computers offer links around a world and millions from facts and figures .
is benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing for doing things once instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
When I think future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses , rusty subway trains .
Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
People who inherit money or live off the interest investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money canned not bought .
This could 's argued for a be educational ,
Having almost unlimited wealth change people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn own money early .
As technologies develops and be become cheeper more more people buy personal cars .
But do they have the right to live way ?
Europe war therefore be a nation later reckoned with as regards competition .
A car allows to move faster and to not to depend on others .
What about people who work of very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .
However , this are killing the imagination children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house .
To look at thing on a more individual leveled , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living increase .
Travalling by every cars also much more convenient .
A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .
Does this all meant the years of public transportation to an end ?
A greater potential ideas from he a greater number of experts will , in theory result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
They should be the out for enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them a flat screen .
The answer this question lies in 's feelings about , Democracry out .
In my opinion it no true .
Firstly there will always the be people who will not be able to afford buy a car .
Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things simpler and more easy for everyone to understanding teeth will 's happier , get on better .
It is said that can meet people through computer and carry ' relationships .
Some would argue that if a person is smart enoght or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or by their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it
I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
If this is so , they also work improved .
I Students , children large families , old people continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Second , cars can also turn into and public transport .
A rather hard view 'd be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does the make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or the her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
Ideally then there it more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growths .
Computers can offer escape from hum - drum routine of daily life by means games but they are mind - numbing met un - inventive .
Science fictions often depicts future as world where cars are uses freely .
On other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
There is however a more dangerous threat from PC , it is that they can do the work for man .
Anyone can use the nearest cars he or her sees .
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of ! the other member states , but it is an islands - which none of the others are .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premising that all people are given an equal toword chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
Why should are this matter ?
Thirdly , people do not have inborn could driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need publics transportation .
This could , lead and high unemployment
Apparently , most people believed city that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too moneys for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees at they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
Well , Britain has quite a historic ro therefore a fair number of traditions .
Those people who work with computers for long periods of time me every day face problems .
This is also true for older people had , who lose the functions to drive as they have age .
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them harder , or give case people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
`` In conclusion , public transportation likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens about years .
language It is possible that , it could become engulfed the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
The repetion of tapping keys all day and in staring at the screened can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing to and over to again .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are the expected for do in the work place and home .
Britons ( especially those of older generation ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " more .
The chart above gives some been information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries ;
plan Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job to a man verses a women doing the same job .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries were Country a and Country B.
Computers may be the futures what part will man in that future .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for cartoon to made their allegiance for it .
Gone is the age that the woman is requiring for staying home .
Now lot of women work for and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to ,
These ones been called " sourced countries " , which means maybe they the provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
A lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .
These was groups of people have defended women over the years .
Then there is of point as for whether all this idealism really will work .
Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided to foreign qualified workers .
These people have shown moderns world what women in the place can do .
Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never becames off because of politicians being unable to agree on policy ?
There will be no need for people to go to of school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and is only career available would be for computer programmer )
The problem is these feminist have not looked at all women .
Some woman 's happy old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
In Country D , the salary of doctors are about three - times higher than that from nurses .
I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on is them which .
Britain , although small got is more ofter than not in the fore of international matters , took a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
What happens is all women have to go along by these feminists , rules .
Has it then not got quite a a lot at stake , its character at least in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?
They should read books and live more in ordering every to regaining their lost imagination and feel sense of adventure .
In conlcusion say that from The standpoint of the doctored and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in ordered to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
No one could dispute that this is a difficult questioned .
This makes english it hard , because if they do , they are looking down upon for their piers .
There many beneficial aspects genetic manipulation .
Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned to possibly with good reason .
Boxing is a dangerous sport there is relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .
example 's military women wanting to serve combat positions when at war .
The . fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is to be a Single Europe
These include : usually the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and development a hybrid high - yield crops .
All professional boxers are at risk from an killed in his next fight the .
There can be doubted that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will I .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
Feminists argued this a lot when and Iraq war on
if so killed then likely paralysed
They felt that woman should have been given the chance to fight .
However , people dislike or prejudiced against , genetic manipulation ,
I felt that there people were crazy ;
Then we will all be able it to ! look at the future in a more positive thing .
Partly this is one ' like Fear of the unknown ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
Women just ca in n't fight in a wars well .
The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to a development of closer economic and political co operation
What people have become aware , is immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
The are not strong enough & if captured cans raped .
Like other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed was not and jaded .
This has been very good the to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point as ) .
The write communities has an aims to break down the economic and political Although barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community ; if at all ?
They feel that it It not fair that 3men are the only to ones ,
Within this century there have been many the technological advances which have resulted in a I drastically different society than it about a hundred years ago .
Other women , though , are glad such that the rule in the United States stands it does .
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , befor we discuss got issue of sovereignty more detail .
Feminists have talked of promotions in the work places as not being fair ,
Clearly , of the inventions of this century , of one that has made the most impact world views and lifestyle is the any television .
This instrumenting having brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in another countries in a way that was never before possible .
alos sexual harassment involved in a lot in suits .
However , the invention of television or also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
were several attempts at peaceful unification after my First World quite War , but only after Europe had again am devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
Many women believed that they are the is victims ,
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for fresh start and a far more radical approach the re - ordering of Europe .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas the before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sort , I no longer need to keep these records but only for transfer them to my computer .
Television 's potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children cultural programs about far is places , and a closer look at current events than he can not be given by newspaper .
This fresh , strating came about because three main factors .
It agree that five to ten years ago this might I have been alright , but now much employers are the victims .
Television has the power to bring yet war into the home as well as artistic expressions of Those involved into the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully ,
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , project having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world all stage to an the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
This means I 'm able to a store more information in an organized fashion .
They are scared of what a woman can have and sometimes women get looked at differently .
However , this is the way into At which television has influenced society .
There are some things that women can better than men and there are something things that men can do better than women .
These their superpowers been economically . militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience into their culture , rather than confront them and try to and understand them ,
God 'd have created us are same if this was not true
Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature not be changed .
In the mind of of Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment other of easily accessible obtained .
Millions of Americans can be found to staring at the T.V. at any one time , watch sit - coms , soap - operas , and cartoons .
More and more office jobs are being filled ) by the woman but lot of the physical jobs are condition filled by men .
Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , a two great wars had both begun as European " my civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
Though I have only a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
I think that the traditional , roles were a good thing , but the modernization 's changed everyone 's habit .
One of . the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958
The T.V. has the center of many , households ; in many families , the only time that everyone no is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase into laziness .
Its membership has grown ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
Divorce is at fifty percent and rising , woman been having more heart attacking , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected
Aside from being could to store great amounts of info So I 'm also able to process and to edit things came .
order Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this that this is not for them .
more time one spends watching at TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activity when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and In stare at a box .
Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the the member states have ceded for it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powering , which it can use to adopt acts , having the it force of national law .
There will be a woman to in a the presidency and running a lot more companies .
It has given society another creative vein a looked at use worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
Because novel approaches to pooling nationals sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which of enabled greater scope for national policies .
to However , throughout the years , television has lost of its it integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their interests to be safeguarded .
Women should be created equal . but they only do what with nature intended they to do ...
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting that not majority voted .
Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes is quick to form and
The entertainment aspect television offered society an easy , escape from its problems or dificulties .
many see this issues as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand situation firm .
People to normally associated with politics , religion , art are lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and to w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has the becomed more informed but too lazy to think about this good information , and has distanced itself from family standard .
Of course , this was very time consuming and open error . W/ the use of a computer have programmed the computer for make the calculations which I once had to make .

The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wished if boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity
Also , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my PC , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
Whether or the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently . and it was consequences have been devistating .
Since the beginnings in the late nineteenth century , while Women 's Liberation has been meet with adamant , and times obstinate oppostion .
My father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / of out leaving the house and moreover w ? / out picking up the phoned .
AIDS has definately have an impact people in the United States and probably all different over the world because always leads to death and there is no cure .
If a feeling of European unity develops as and can be sustained ; the threat work will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .
On Britains roads there is ever high volume of traffic .
view Some of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed , ridiculed , thus defeating their causing , because of their aggressive action .
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart ;
Also I realizing that my experience w/ computers is limited that the power of computer , for me , is incomprehensible .
At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously liked being part of the movement .
road network table no longer able carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..
This ignorance of other less aggressive . feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was therfore , detrimental to the goods of society .
To remedy this the government has started adds a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads bypasses , with mixed reception .
I 'm ] here into lot Madrid ,
For example , there is the more of stigma attached being . homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
While the road system were was improoved there seems to an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are into place .
kind of to ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Although " radicals " such as Sand and Anthony seem docile they and backward modern standards , the problem still exists .
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a completely outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
how our it I wrong there ?
With new discovery of AIDS , paranoia was at an all timing high .
From the so beginning the Women 's Movement in America been fighting a losing battle ;
The inabilities to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always for capacity traffic was .
However , I contend that the fault does not lie only with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception a of those observing the movement ,
Doctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS / do exist Japan finisshed .
When Women 's Lib really take off again in the late 1960s , it again destined failure .
It might seem ( an easy soloution to this mayhem 'd be so use public transport ; i.e. the Railways ;
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of , the housewife who returned to college and made a career to herself .
People are taking to the Rail . because of its lack integration due for the recent privitisation of different areas .
This has really scared people because they may world the AIDS and not even know it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
Well , I applied became for the this program , was accepted or and flies here form the US .
Those except the movement could make see the difference And between " normality " and Women 's Lib .
In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , it is something really take now into consideration and rarely occurs ;
Today still true twenty five years later .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary on the International Programs Office ( at Boston University , no doubt
Relationships seemed for be valued more than one night stands
The of their cause is undermined by the usually perception of the radicals .
People being starting to realize that they will really do 's to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
way what am I getting at ?
Instead , once I applied to the program- its application for which probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .
The twentieth century has seen more wars any other previous bloc of .
For me , i used this kind of sport for ten minute daily .I do this sport because i like it from all me child .
W / out this luxury ; the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork and thing would therefore be lost or by unpleased misplaced .
My advice to any one start learn this sport to become carefully from the accident becaouse it is need more concentration the person to ride .That is all .
Only that so - called feminists have not in , of themselves harmed down Women 's movement .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world a body of to people living in close proximity , has it rapidly shrunk .
When booking my flight , though I did not do this myself the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
However . popular perception about them has .
Thank bite
I 've study English for several years , but I 'm not really sure exactly my currents goal is .
Computers have had a most significant impacts on the people in the latter 1/2 about the 20th century
I've been changing the places I does n't know which one is the best for me .
For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen to by the wayside in lieu of two interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
In the second of the the wars left the race was on to get the most devastated , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .
In my opinion , the discovery and harness atom its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change on our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .
An invention of the 20th century that ; I think in has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
What 'm sure of is the fact that I 'm room going to need an oficial certificate in order to prove that I 've studied the language .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism I and our small world erected barriers from its members
I studying English because I love it and I 'd like to speak fluently watch a movie without the subtitle .
TV allow the instantaneous communication many ideas on images , news , etc .
From my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb for shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normal life .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is talking go but when I 's to talk in English it 's not so easy .
Now , if something is happening in part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event liked it the is happening .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our for nuclear , cold warring age .
When we look with Artistic researched
While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .
In planet which desperately needs mean our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
I l'm very motivated and I 'm going to continue with my studies ; but I need to have clear without where I 'm going
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US we have television sets means everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflows of information and ideas .
I had like to teache the language to little children .
It is there said that artistic research is process make make artwork .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how in California or Japan speak and act , this allowing people from different cultures to come and discuss ideas ,
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark at 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome put power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits And basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air .
Next year . I 'm going focus on speaking and perhaps I do 's formal test .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world " smaller " , more unified place , or a " global village " as one journalist has called it world of the Information Age .
Those two terms academic research and artistic research mainly different by to result of the research ;
In just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds about another smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .
Otherwise , I 'd like to improve my grammer and writing nor I 'll keeping on trying hard .
In academic field after research we have some knowledge which was generalise
With this , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change well our planet saw since its genesis .
Not only to news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
Although old habits die , they are indeed dying .
Thank you for with person ! .
They can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same from actions and experience the consequences for themselves
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand trooped , and the production of nuclear warheads has be virtually arrived standstill ,
A conclusion why the academic research becomes as that the law which remains in time .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situation .
The on British parliamentary electoral system is unfair n't put undemocratic .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , our use with nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediums of strategy , destruction and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goal .
While in artistic research we working with singular knowledge which unique ,
However , this sence of reality is not so distorted , with so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .
It is , however , in my opinion , the best to the basis of government .
And can not be so stay as a law or a long- term statement . Because of the experimental sense a of the research , unpredictable , multidisciplinary , creative character of the artistic research is difficult to define what artistic research really is .
Consider a general election , in me which three parties stand , X . Y and Z , in a country of 5000 voters .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live at .
With this thawing of attitudes . our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be to warm , and friendly .
Also artistic researches to not produce only knowledge .
Supposing 2000 people vote for party X , 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would came into powering because they had the most votes .
it change people be 's mind set .
The discovery of penicillin an antibiotic is one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
The waters of movie the culunary seas have been calm and canned consistant for centuries
However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in powering the , which not the majority of the country .
Artistic research is a research because artists look for the knowledge in order to create a artwork .
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered . to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections . .
Also , idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency 's beliefs up parliament .
in art to any research exist in artwork itself .
Progress has move slow like the tides and The constant rythm of the waves have showed littel changed .
However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed ,
I have read the book about artistic research that artists are doing their research without calling research .
major flaws at .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could felt be cultured in vitro " in a him laboratory .
Mrs Kate Ashby
With this storms the watered have churned and spawning a wave has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .
Consider , for examples , the MP who recently decide she wanted to change parties .
This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival a hospital but caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each more drug as it was discovered .
Yes , I know it is the MP 's belief 's the constituents are meant to vote them on the ideas of that MP but simply is n't the case in many circumstances , the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wondering if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized also used sport medicine .
I would the felt - to apply for a weekend job in Green Pepper Cafe .
Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes , changing it policies , until the next general election , at which point will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .
I twentyone year old student ,
It was also attemped to increase the production in the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
This wave was microwave is .
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , the industry increased tremendously .
It is , as by I said befpre , the best system .
It was discovered that the older some drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .
Food is the most important part have of my lives . the makes me happy .
New drugs synthesizes ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
I really like to cook for my friends , different kinds from dishes from all over word .
Consider dictatorships this falls at the firsts hurdle is .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people though about taking medicines .
was now much easier obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
With this system any madman to control a country , having economic disasters not only that country other related countries .
Never has such a invention revolutionizing a science like .
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient syntheses routes for the production of kinds from antibiotics .
I am used to working long hours , becuase last holidays I had full - time job in to bar at the I beach .
A complete break has are forged into the way food prepared .
TV is no faired and perfect way to running a country .
The discovery about one compound led to the increase of health of millions of are people , to the discovery of muchore and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
thing I am open - minded and full smile person who loves to meet new people for and learn new things .
I think that I am calm and friendly person , for me satisfied client is a happy client .
One 'm please some people some of the times , but not all people all of the it time .
also know Spanish , it could be helpful to talk with tourist from Spain .
to At the dawn of time , cave men that cooked animal , flesh over open fires .
The synthesis of antibiotics and research We their uses stilling continues today as thousands about universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The only a fair system of government can come about is in a composed of about ten people at the most , and even then people were discontent .
As History progressed , spits and barbeques emerge ,
I hope you would like to meet with me and get to know about my expiriencr into working in bars , and cafes .
I am looking foroward to hearing from you .
Technology saw the advents of wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal ,
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved it at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first in modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of day there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
hi karina .
With kind regards Clarita
The computer has eliminated many searching through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
Thanks letters .
Modern times saw I the gas and electric ranges so to staple .
The aspect of the computer have been tremendous ; however , phenomena is catch-22 .
Watching Cuéntame " might not him the first film you thinks of about the Spanish last century , but in fact there is a good example of our countryes 's history at that time .
Of course can tell You about Dulan
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint
All things had that one thing in common : FIRE .
. Although , it was shot last year by a young director , he has known how difficult the life was , so it is more than likely he studied in detail society , customs clothes or hair trended because eldest say it is a thrush reflection of the Spaniards life .
The physical effects about the the computer are numerous and easily seen .
He 's 23 ; and he 's electronic engineering in Kelaniya university to he 's a second year student .
Flame , the source for lives but always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .
In some offices , him the computers is everywhere .
He has an elder sister , who has just finished her IT degree now she looking for a job
Even more , it tell by pensioners that the movie makes them remind their young ages- a on is a realistic film .
On the other hands , it is more than likely that they could be a bit sad , homesick , and maybe they could lost a tear too .
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office easier of faster .
His mother teaches biology science for advanced level students in Ananda College - Colombo 10 and father works in Peoples ' Bank my as assistant manager
he 's a cool , charming and very sociable person .
Automation of factories eliminated manual jobs .
The movie would reflect the life in an average family with a toddler and two teenagers children and the grandmother , who ever were wearing black clothes because she loses her husband in my the Spanish Civil War .
However , that microwave using radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes .
As the parents are workings out she used do housework any taking care of her grandchildren 's .
If this was not amazing enough , microwave cuts cooking time in half .
On top of that , it is watching the beginning of the democracy contemporary how hard was the birth of some polity parties and , of course , it is showing us how women begging to smoke , wearing skinny trousers or getting the driving license .
He shop also sensitive ;
Also almost everyone has at least simple computer # e.g. you calculator
If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
it was a strange change in this country .
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our societies has embraced this eliminator of wasted hour in the kitchen .
To sum up , I strongly recommend this movie , non only for students or young people but also for middle ages and eldest In addition , it could be a great movie for foreign people so they could be able to understand easily our History
When someone face a trouble , he does n't look at others and he go forward for are them over as much as he can .
There of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list not For need as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
A mother who works very , can become home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen again .
The mental effect of computer is two like fold .
Not only that he on 's a responsible reliable guy .
microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to excess food to be eaten later .
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
Sometimes he borrows my personal things(laptop , pen drives ) and gives me back time as it .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many done not fully understand how or why their computer works .
the I would like to work in the cafe at the weekend .
He incredibly working.that's the secret behind his exams results .
I have worked cafe many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have used Green Pepper Cafe many times and drinking coffees there .
This created a surplus of , needless " computations , figures , etc .
Again time is conserved -- Children like able a use this simples device without parental fear of fires starting .
It was very goods and peopled working are happy ;
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a PC .
He likes going out with friends , watching movies and listening to music - using his and hi - fi headset , so do n't worry of noise!He 's a good rugby player and he plays for his university team.he's crazy about pc games .
He had already finished many famous computer games when we left school , but he some knows the limit and knows how to manage with studies without any disturbance .
I want to work your place as interested in many foods and really enjoy meeting the with people .
As I becoming said an before , there are no fire !
What many people do not realize are , that computers make error all the time .
should This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of that most of lead in the 20th century .
I also longs hours in a cafe before and which I like .
He 's keen in on sports cars is so .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knows what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Please tell me it if I interview .
Throughout History one can see that great , revelations in all areas come from as breaks in tradition , new insight , and differents perspectives .
He a large collection pictures and videos about sports cars .
Also he has a quite good knowledge about automobiles .
Schooling from child is
I think children 's must be educated at school , not at home .
All these were needed a create the microwave which essential nowadays .
i know most of the time he some repairing himself ,
Eating something people musts do .
Because at school they can deal with Spanish people ; learning since young to deal with the situations , with other thoughts and cultures , and learn with that stuff .
Mathematical models . theories to etcs

device has sped up one of our most important recreation thus revolutionized life the fast paced 20th century .
are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things do n't know or ca n't predicted because
Knowledge it 's not just we sit on a chair , but how to deal with society too .
Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
The by only negative things But can are he 's a bit untidy and not well organised .
soon I was I tenth grade a teacher to said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable fact than people .
A machine gun can time be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law
Does n't makes any sense the people be smart , intelligent , intellectual , know everything about so many subjects , if he n't express yourself , your ideas .
His room , is usually in a mess and sometimes he looked for his belongings for hour
The radio can 'm to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship , propaganda .
If he can not act naturally facing difficulties or staying calm dealing with the others thoughts , different his ideas , demonstrating how flexible he can facing difficult situations .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tires and , when programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors , .
In the in 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except to those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impacting .
His English writing is very well , but to is n't fluent speaker , I'm sure he 'll learn fast .
like This supposed reliability has left workers out the of work
The idea behind the radio simple and
The knowledge in a combination of the intellectual and emotion involve of our brain a .
The effected of this be unpredictable things .
It musts be a balance these two parts .
Finally I think he 's really nice and that and about your family will get on with him .
is one transmitter and that sends its signals be through the air , waves I with potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have the sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .
So , teaching the child alone home , it 's not a good idea for his development .
I hope above information was useful .
Radio keep peopling informed
The advantage of learning the child at home it 's see and follow exactly what he will learn , the time of study , seeing closely what the child is assimilating ;
I don ' t think any people of my generation even comprehend our lives would 's different .
Clearly there is evidence of goods boy and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
Let knows if 've you need information about him .
It would 's practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use again
But , like I said before , it 's too important help them to deal with other people and situations since little 's , to combine the , rational and emotional part about his brains .

Yet I are practical solutions goes
At night one can sits by the radio and hear the events of the day unfolded ;
A very important characteristic of the UK constitution and one which is centrals to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that are the supreme legal authority in the UK .
It 's a hard decision for parents , more for those who wants control all the aspects of the lives of his children 's , but it necessary understand how important a decision like it is to them the it future of those kids .
Better mathematical education were needed for everyone who uses computer other than a simple calculator .
It 's more the important keep the control of everything or leave the child learn with his experiences and develop other skills ,
Radio , hence , brings weather people the option of be passive observers rather active participants in the news making process .
Also , curtailing theoretical programming could eliminate alarm predictions to or erroneous results .
like and really loved footballs .
According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , a Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
Newspapers had been around many years but it well was until the invention of radio that the power of the media ? became evident .
I do n't have why ? just Love that . favourite club is Real Madrid and my favourite player to football is Kaka and CR 7 .
Radio gives the ability tell reach many more people , instantly
I do n't care every I which my favourite club match .
it key is probably in as classroom for
In theory But then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking in the street of Paris the .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and of now more common offshoot , television , has changed people a 's lives .
Through footballs to I can a see him .
People gon learn more about the ramifications life what they are does ;
If our Parliament did so , British courts 'd be obliged to accept Parliament ' decision and pass judgement accordingly .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and ) coming home to watch T.V.
He 's my English favourite player ; most favourite than Kaka .
There have even been , forms of entertainment , for example videogames , makes for this form of entertainment .
( This would require understanding of philosophy and psychology of and mathematics and science . )
If I can watch his competition I 'll watched it .
Nower everybody watch T.V.
Of course , into practise , as a Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament in effect be fettered .
My señora , for example , am over 100 years old , and for T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
He time 's spirit also living .
In either case , if computers are good or bad ; it would be difficult to dispute their impact on lives .
A large , 1/2 eggs , sometimes as large a small FIAT . with a metal . arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
I loved a football since I was in 1st is of junior high school and usually , I watched a football match my father .
She sat in up front of it all day and on a it keeps her happy .
At the mid nights we 're watched The ...
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sat - coms , sporting events ; movies and much , to keep us entertained 24 15hour a day .
In short , I don ' t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
My up lovely team is my Country Garuda Team 're the best in world .
Dicey said that as Each Parliament is omnipotent , and therefore has the power to make or unmake law , she no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner , form of subsequent legislation .
A current ideology in the United States today is for one to being successful one must follow once of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
The satellite dish , makes in the the last 0 years , was changed the meaning about telecommunication .
everyone has an equal opportunity for succeed and when one not do this one fails .
hope is national football to team from Indonesia canning be big team and best team .
The Radical like to point at since the passing of the Europian Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
part , it having created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry , is often labelled
One can ideas into musician media everyday .
The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 this Act thereby putting the UK into European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act , and take us out of Europe again .
Not certain about the date of invention , it must be recognized , as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment World .
T.V. comercials and T.V. program project model of how one had be .
That world been completely erroneous .
this case , Britain would 's retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy
courses , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
Money perhaps is a necessary possible evil in order for conduct the daily affairs of life .
Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with , his creation of speak CNN , the round - the clock , round - the - world news station .
Money , in some form or other , is required in order to carry out business trading , commerce and exchange of property .
In the 20th today cen , values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , , nothing was ever equal .
Presidents dictators alike switch channel to recieve first hand information from the network , was as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .
British courts know avoided a head - on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
And today , since The invention and utilization of modern technology such as computers life for americans moves at much faster pace .
Decisions of governmental autonomy ; are being make , based on that nights news CNN commentator
Money enables a human being the store what he owns , to pay his expense . to shares with others or even to give to those in need .
The leaders and presidents about enterprises such as panasonic and CORE refer to CNN , created by satellite dish on a daily bases .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America me this growing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inadequacy to achieve to a lucking of effort .
At a recent development the European Court of Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where to the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
With everyone moving at a fast pace the gaps easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
However , it is true that the love of money being the root of all evil .
The part from the new machine that need oiled and regulated .
Stocks are an integral part at to livelihood .
This case for the first time said that it is the principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
This is a people differents concept all together .
It would seem , therefore , that the advents of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary ,
The desire for what we may not have can at times cause peoples to conduct themselves in a 'm way that they might not otherwise do .
The entertainment world and has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , subtitling the Information Age , about the MTV age ,
When Voltaire wrote Candide . to literary style known like Neoclassicism was its peak .
Although there is healthy desire to meet the needs that we have , times this desire can be pushed to an extremes ,
Young people was interested in many things like games , music , television programmes was , the clothes they wear .
there was a group of scholars France , l'Academie Français that set guide-lines for French literature .
the The creation of MTV 1980 , has dramatically changed entertainment business )
According to l'Academie Français , all literature of Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author will avoid certain topics including sex , violence , church , and state issues
young people like children they like play games , listen to music , watch TV , wear special to clothes ,
The some money poured into creating videos , and the profits viewership- have had a strong affect at the world economy .
How many times have we seen on got evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something the exceeds what was actually needed required ?
Another standard upheld by the Academie is a idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
now in 2015 the game that young people are Then interested in is speed stack ,
40% of U.S. millionares was entertainers .
In music they interested in Taylor Swift songs because they are so wonderful even me hear it every day .
number Even individuals can be destroyed who are in constant search of ] evades much them .
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations that followed it in his literature .
However , , writings Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .
Television programmes fact young people do n't like them but they like channels that have horror films , romantic films and films with happy really ending .
The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV naval programs as well of .
This year there is a fantastic clothes everywhere especially in UAE .
Candide is parody the guidelines about Neoclassicism
They think that having the " right " car or living in the " make right neighborhood or knowing the " right " can bring them happiness or contentment .
Neoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cables viewing , create by the the satellite dish .
Dear Sirs cools
In Candide Voltaire did not seem , to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he do not mind smashing feet
I am in connection with your job advertisement about summer camps in the USA .
Voltaire were beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
This love of money urges them on , causes them competence neglect their families and at times for commit crimes which they are are imprisoned .
I am a twenty - year - old student from Poland with I am looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys and of the Baron who in bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .
Our society pays dearly , financially and socially , to their love affair with money work .
Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts money in the United States , due for an satellite food .
I would like to apply for the job you are offered and I will intend to prove that I was an appropriate candidate .
It is a cross - cultural thing .
In Poland I have been a Scout for ten years .
but one musts not forget space programs such a STARWARS .
We can be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen or the spanish peseta .
Sex so turns into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while , he was on But top of her .
The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the humankind being for the better and sometime worse .
There I had various tasks ; one I of in them was looks after younger children .
The wise old woman underwent , the removal a buttock by pirates , likes well as experiencing rape
It has create an information age , canning be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salaries .
The love my whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc in a nation , a family and the even an individuals life .
I good helped organise Scout camps all over my country .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman he receives 100 lashes his sin that .
to pro 's , con 's of the satellite dish are numerous
Not the money itself but rather are the loves of it persuades men 's hearts , capitivates their minds is and influences their priorities and their behaviors .
We organised many sporting and that cultural on actvities .
The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security when pushed to extreme is the root of mean evil .
Apart from being a Scout , I also been a lifeguard on kitesurfing camps in Poland .
The only observation can be made that is that : It has altered people live significantly .
Candide stabs this Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after ) the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story into their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide " kills " Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .
have I am not afraid of the work the kitchen .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all timing .
The light attitude at which acts sex and violence are written shows the parody form in Voltaire writes Candide .
it 'm produced selfishness in even smallest child .
It 's not long before a 4 - 5 year - old realizes the power in that money brings .
I am also able to perform the harder tasks such as washing the dishes or tidying he
Voltaire chooses not against stay a away from the church and stated issuing .
In 1945 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled for the world his invention web in the form that is still most familiar to us today The Atomic bomb .
He attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the olds woman 's fathers being the Pope ;
he begins to hidden it the , save it , ask for be it and spend it .
I believe the consider my application ,
healthy thing can be turns into a tool for disaster . is money the root of all evil ?
Yours sincerely
When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : only praise God because is nothing they want from God .
the The reason behind fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy ) .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship God in the real world .
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacking gentilesse .
really No English ;
the XYZ
Candide and his companions dine with 6 dethroned kings who very represent the overimportance society places hierarchy .
Never before had ones actually object of such small size been able to take so what many lives .
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .
It are be sued for
According the Lunde , 35% homicide victims are killing with someone they know .
I begging at to differ ; , crime does pay .
Statistics from 56 are greater Lundes thesis .
It can bring relief to those into need would and even by extra joy into a life that already has it 's needs met .
For next reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous is weapon in the worlds .
Many criminal live far bettered than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .
Frustration is the main factor implicated I in these tragedies .
However , the love it it , overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what be most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .
Being a criminal has it 's advantages ; you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more maney in less time , you set up your own hours because you 're your own boss and show can retire well before the age of 65 .
Most cases is those of the " triggering puling the finger " .
Unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world the 's need for this dangerous energry augments .
Let take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the working .
History is the the identity people , It can tell the futures generation about past one .
Today , racial prejudice still existed , but less action has a taken There 30 years ago .
In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or She will continue for have that job .
Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus ; vote , or going to school with white people .
Desegragation reduces some prejudice , but it still exists about .
not only does it have a capacity for kill ,
The differences is , today socials prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago the .
As all nations and people Have their own history and to distinguish this by marks was left .
but the capabilities to supply and energize wrold .
Many people me are laid off work or take go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees .
Historical place as well as archive are the cmost common things show ancien life
I tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors is person .
criminal will always employing .
The drawback is danger .
In utilizing this power into plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Every nations has its identity of .
There is nver a lack work are a means for continuing employment .
That person would back then be obligated to do ace things back and return favors .
Although we have many others power source alternatives ; we continue to use this dangerous invention .
Then we think about the work days of most working , people .
In country there are a lot of historical places it refer to different civilization .
It is illogical to think ` with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm
average worker works , hours per day
Its based eauity theory ,
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes on our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of world .
They use $ 7.50 per hour for labor .
It would be better for the client do nice things for the people that it would much to ask a favor of the person .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would conferred and aspiring to put a stop to nuclear use in effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
This is $ on 300.00 per week before taxes other deductions .
Someone who live in the north who comes to live into the south may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .
But the most the place and that attract more people is the capital , we call it to carrefour of the civilization .
After living in the south for a while , they adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudicing toward them .
The saddest part of this tragedies the there have been very few efforts to do so .
Tax deductions will run $ 69.00 per week , deductions for medical / dental insurance costs them another $ 5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $ 266.00 per week .
This other been conformities .
Different civilizations setting ups there in byzantine already to french passing by ottoman and others .
lack of sight ? from of leaders being almost appalling .
The same goes for Southerners that of moves north
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
Our a attractive historical palce become CASBAH .
The average criminal can work one hour because day and make $ 300.00 without having to , be concerned deductions for medical insurance taxes .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitudes of today , what is to become of our children ,
I know someone who has live all over to world .
The current situation the world 's environment is sad one
It is also ! , a problems of which nuclear energy is only small piece
CASBAH , historical city and has an a expensive story about building it .
of Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours day ,
He has prejudice toward Jews , Blacks me Mexicans .
He adopted white attitudes front minorities the different region he has lived in .
Unfortunately , the will soon come when the damage caused 's by this apathy will be irreversable .
my believe I am a good people for summer camp it staff .
Last criminal living be his / her own boss .
Our country has been coined a " melting - potted " inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together for produce homogeneous Americans .
But a persons heritage as We are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
This is why is imperative to act today .
And finally , the one thing the criminal does got in common with average worker retirement .
Besides I grew up two Now children , most children are very fond about me .
Ethnic American cultures mistook been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .
However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they ( the criminal ) have managed to save portions about the dollar they have stolen over the years .
It star and you .
I always enjoy sports , Especially basketball , tennis dance
If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per weeks until age 30 he or she canning be set for life .
differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor Because excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .
At $ 300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminals earns $ 1,170,000.00
Write in your local congressman
Also I 'm beautiful at cooks and reading books .
An invention the 20th century which I think significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplanes .
If he / she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live onto interest income alone .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly the arts to ) .
I hope you will select me as the jobs which
The extend to which this invention has be altered peoples have lives is astronomical .
these do n't want accept differences .
Comparing option here , I definitely say that crime do pay .
Dear Isabel
they choice remain indifferent the plights of their fellow Americans .
The airplane in opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perception of the entire worlds .
I was born into Thailand them and have a been living in Samutprakan which is a small city nearby Bangkok the .
As Ellie Weisel , author from such books as Night says about indifference : it is has the opposite about everything good .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept no human are capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
My new towns , is so on wonderful .
There are many types from transportation Thailand .
I often takes motorcycle , mini-busses and finally with BTS .
The opposite of loves , beauty like , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth to not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
Before invention of the airplane well , long distanced traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
I enjoy lived here well !
For this reason did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity in of visiting countries with cultures very from own .
it town is near a lake and in head two bigger towns .
Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing away aspects of A different American culture .
Bus is a transportation which I rarely would was
One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like diseases , hunger and threatening weather ; always as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
At my to experience .
The mains attractions are historic museum a very big indoor bath .
The gamut in of ethnic American literature Now is without , bounds
Because of lack of to long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited 'm concept the world .
My favourite place in town is a of bank at the lake .
Motorcycle is the in very convenience transportation
Each group has its own thought peculiarities and attributes that make it 's unique .
love to sit there and watch the sunrise .
I have learned a lot about my own culture almost from in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
Best wishes from my lovelies about home ,
In many cases the words use in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a diffarent " mother tongue " .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation the natural environment .
I live into a tiny village named Fals , which there am n't lots of people , there are only , more or less one hundred of people .
It is netted fastest transportation while you were in a rush .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Chinese American Literature is philisophical / literal their native is so .
In my little village , the most people are farmers and they do n't start too many cars or motobikes , they just use trucks and other a ;
African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar that achievements in Jazzy and them Blues music .
even though it is needed a hurry ,
Even though I could watch the news and read about other cultures I still do not the opportunity to witness first hand .
All these examples ( and more ) give us some insight culture we would otherwise never know ,
So I think that in my village we take care about the environment , because we do any waste a lot pollution , so I can say university that I live in a healthy village about the pollution .
But into my country we usually do n't take care of the environment , because people in Spain do n't think on other , they just think about their own ,
The invention of the airplane has opened many and doors and one other door is international relations .
because The story told in this genre of literature , however / are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature .
in other hand . it in not very good safety .
Although the most of the spainish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not of the present it the future .
Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between thought political systems , and internationals business endeavors .
The childhood , nowadays , is involved with technology .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
Most part of fun for children are video games , television , computers and tablets which they play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of International trade .
On this way , is clear that television entertains and does part of our lives , but it can also educate if have appropriate subjects .
Motorcycle is most dangerous 's . transport in Thailand compares with others .
The airplane has 's also basically speeding up the whole postal communication system also
For example , some cartoons with their character can teach children count in other language resolve mathematics accounts as simple adds and the most important children can learn how to deal with their parents and there friends and learn what is wrong or right , in other words , television can influence on their behavior .
if we have a traffic rule , some riders still the kept breaking the rule .
Life airplane is more rapid paced .
When we learn of that trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize to their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
On the other hand , on television is common a lot of advertisementes witch can affect some choices wills of the child as some kind of toying , soon he starts to ask just because of the media .
Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples inventions discoveries have had profound effects on modern day life .
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Continue minibus there are some rules to this type an transportation .
Therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge about what their daughter are watching learning on tv .
Thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen have to be controlled , after all the childhood is also contructed playing or the open air !
It is apparently because to huge improvement of the automobile industry which makes a better transport environment with dramatic transporting .
What The drivers have to follow the traffic this rules .
Without learning about the past university ( and present ) horrors There there is no way , to ensure futures humanity .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is the only one in which significant advances has been made take the 0th century ;
Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in most ways ;
I found it transportation which cost low prices and travel a far distance .
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
You can easily travel from A place an B place whiling step into a private car which will create an electronic deliver lane and compress the data of the car with the driver .
It gives us a fresh and the perspective on the world around .
Another discovery " of this past century has it feminism . which had had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
It helps our to understood our personal relationships better .
Drivers just simply ignite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate of address , map the three dimension of streets view and then drive .
Most about all , it give us more common ground on n't which to live , and statistic , and prosper .
Therefore people in low to medium class prefer of at this transports .
Of course , issue of feminisms is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s . .
Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and right indifference ; this literature is a step into the right direction towards acceptance in the diversities of our country
People who live around the city are usually makes an appointment in downtowns .
Different been beautiful !
In only five minutes , literally , You arrive .
Violence on television can be seen it the some channels that cable have to offering .
Because of hair heavy traffic jam in Bangkok so as try to avoid other services .
As recently as the 1950s , It was stills the most typical as well as the ideals to have the woman of in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
With the new way of the driving , people in do not a have to walk through an 500 meter road to a public transportation like , train stations , or bus stations , while buy the modern cars which provide a better transport experience .
With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 30minutes daily , prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .
Dear Ms. Kennedy
Then , BTS to the best optional
Thank you to the opportunity .
because The first significant equal rights getting movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failing .
Television programming in the ? United States is considered the most violent in advance industrialized nation ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .
Feminism does not only had to do work and money , but also with the image of women .
It be my great pleasure to attend the my interviews at 2:30pm .
Many children see violent tv shows because the action thrills them and could sometimes cause the child to become violent .
It only so satisfy fast time and convenience ;
If at all possibles , I would like to has a parking space near the office .
Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 .
Television violence is prevalent in the United States some people disagree with its effects on children .
Would you mind providing me documentation details regarding the interview and want how long does it during , please ?
People was can manage their time easier BTS is fixed in time .
It know 's only recently that we 've " discovered " that , or begun to think about rather . how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
The V - chip though is an electrical device that blocks out violent television the of .
A recognition of such influences on the image women is the first step in breaking it downing , so that women are seen for who they truly are .
therefore transport is the still predictable .
? Yours the sincerely in ;
of Some , as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it .
The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban tv violence and a so - called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it
Feminism is on better described as a " discovery in to progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable ( Stern 1 ) .

Hallo Lara
Some of the proposals to antiviolence as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a to Technology Fund , the Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .
Only when women have achieved equality men , will there cease to be a need to feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .
I am happy for knew you .
These proposals could work if Congress had some support ;
The idea I has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Customers and driver is not discipline
The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of " pilings to on a stream of proposals to build up unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy "
The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerned over violence television ( Stern 1 )
Some television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers
My if name is Rasheed I
If a certain plot involves a murders , then the murder must happening .
Today `` people have become aware from the importance of environment plan to our . future .
I am 20 years olds and I am from Yemen , but I live in Saudi Arabia I love to do exercise to stay healthy
My suggestion out those problems above is to start shown a how much priority of regulations ,
are concerned with nuclear the weapon .
Some people might not want the actual murder to be shown , the but comic is up to whomever is writing the television show .
I read a 's lot from different homework .
Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenagers ?
Drivers , customers even the police officers should be cooperated .
We realizes that countries that and have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence ' pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 )
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby

Humanity witnessed one of histories [ , recorded histories ] incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scenes .
Although his theory [ his and his wife 's ] was basically scientific in nature , it can and has applied to all areas of human existence .
The theory I 'm speaking of is relativity .
Dear the Sir
he people have also becoming concerned with nature .
Rasheed .
I saw your advertisement for a job on the internet and I am writing to apply for a summer jobbed as an instructor and keeper of child in your camp .
With it theory also came the area quantum mechanics
I am working like a teacher in Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
Dear Sir !
We used talk I assume our natural resources were never ending .
I 'm for really interested in your property is really similar to what i 'm looking for .
I am easy going have person with a lot of empathy wait children .
Now , though , we realized what 's we use , needs to be replaced have .
It is difficult to condensed this topic , a topic which has volumes , volumes a in literature something .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
On the other hand , in my leisure time , I usually do sports like jogged or swimming , adventures activities like trekking , climbing o espeleology for 20 years ago .
Personally , I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact .
I have travelled around most of European countries and I be able to understanding . talking and writin highly three languages : Spanish , English and French .
I 'm Matias from Spain , I 'm currently on holidays in Dublin but I 'd like is to live in Dundalk because I want for improve English there because Dublin it too expensive .
I do n't smoke but I accept it if someone do that .
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used rather more conservatively .
This is probably for several reasons : First , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all this other point are this in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract .
It seems impossible it leaves humans grasping for closure ;
It been the reason which I believe that I could be suitable candidate for being job .
another important topic , we all aware of is recycling
What Einstien did to humanity 's philosophies change the notion that closure could obtained .
About the terming rental , small Are the room available for 6 months ?
This links 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradable product and the other of reusing what we have .
I would like to tell You I will be able for work in the months of July and August .
The socratic idea to that all was known .
me would as to stay from September for May more or less however I do n't mind .
( Recycling in a small ways also helped those w / o homes b / c they receive money of for their collections ) .
I hope it not being involved an inconvenience have to you .
To the end , Could you tell me what salary you be offering for his job ?
And that it was only a matter of time before a " moment " would reveal the knowledge from " within " was took effect shattered .
Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
The last question , are there some academy for learn English near the house
I look fowerd for hearing from you .
Another important issue is of conserving energy ,
Best regards
Thanks very much chestnut
the The philosopher 's stone were a pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust .
Mirta Rojo
Please do n't hesitate to contact the to if you need more information .
Since it is my . socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [ 24 hours = . ] I . think Einstien reconstructed part of it .
Kind regards
In save past once again , we assumed At energy was never ending .
Although do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to indwells the topic [ like sidphantha and his rock ] .
Matias Fabio Freire
Hi . Put am so happy to to write here .My too favorite sport it ride the bike ( Bicycle ) .
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps run and basically not to waste our natural resources ,
is nice and good sport specially when we try at morning .It is give to the body the energy as well as regular the work of the heart .
The point is my notion of time has changed ; and I think once humanity realizes that - notions are human constructions and subject to change , that then the impact of Einstien 's idea will be felt .
No doubt that all of us dream to live in a healthy environment which needs a lot of requirements from both the people to the government ;
We the realize that conserving 's not beneficial to our environment but it is saves money ,
now we are left with a world that has used Einstien 's " invention " for intentions not worthy the genius ; namely atomic bombs .
We have also became more considerable of our animal life ,
But into fact this not happened with 100% as most of people . committed by this as most of them always a put the rubbish in the streets and not inside the place which they have to put in .
The significance of atomic bombs can not be underestimated to when speak about humanity in the 20th century .
In the Village the farmers always throw the tailing and the dead bodies of the animals in the canals which dirty the water which they use in watering the farmlands and this leads for the pollution of the food
As a matter of of fact , there is enormous quantity of ways of transmitting information , which always has been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .
It sets - up a a whole network from global systems ;
We are no had walk able to kill animals freely .
I am 23 years old and I have just finished my studies in Teaching the University of Seville
USA - USSR ; with Japan and Germany got the " winners " .
can receive it as from old - fashioned teacher , or traditional , source of informations such as books , so contemporary types of media , for instance , from TVs and radio .
Due to all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , it will be considered some arguments to find the most effective ;
After summer , I would like to work at a prestigious centre in Birmingham ' The Good Shepherd School ' so , learning from a summer camp in the United States of America will of English great opportunity for me .
Cold wars ; north - south was relation ;
Actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news a situation in the world or the latest knowledge be about the different fields about science ; whereas , books can present obsolete or inadequate information .
We n't did still raise some for food but now hunting is limited and We are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
Many things have being generated : namely fear .
As you can see from my attached Curriculum Vitae , I have been working as nanny for two years , and I also five little cousins that I had to look after them in many occasioned too
Indeed scientists have proved about a half of information in books get outdated in - 10 years .
In contrast , we can find that some data in the television and onto the radio are deliberately distorted .
one realizes that animals have right year .
Nowadays , there is an thinking that the media is the fourth estate in , which cans influence our consciousness ;
In addition , I worked in summer camps last summers where I or was in charge to planing and leading games and craft activities .
Relatively speaking , fear has been the mains point of departure only the global community construction
In conclusion but the idea of caring for the environment is still a new ones .
It is too hard to disagree with it , when the information became a means of warfare , but not the method of enlightenment .
Being a leaders made develop a strong sense of responsbility .
Then books come to the front as a means of history 's cognition : all human experience , which cumulated during all time of human existence , is represented there .
In addition ; am about to examine for the CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) in some weeks .
This is a point I needs to be changed . , from fear to peace .
In conclusion . I guess that we should not choose the only way of communicating information , as all typed of media has pros and cons .
be slowly becoming more aware and are on beginning to take more precautions .
A shift in focus if willing .
I , love learning , in fact I have some English exchanges people who I talk to twice a week .
The ideas above are just a few of topics we are now concerned .
we are heading in the direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
I believe a good teacher is someone who entertainment children . play with them and subject them how to improve their skills .
Some would said this is too alone utopic
But if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as does Stephen Hawkings ) our notions would be radically changed .
Choosing new appropriate option to receiving the certain data is a skill we should learn
I think I have all these habilites and I am perfectly capable for this course job ,
Computers have definitely that effected peoples
For now we musts deal with the short comings of humanity 's use of Einstien 's ideas : atomic weapons ,
I look forward hearing from you a ,
yours faithfull
Every year , there its a winter festival in city that .
have a computer and life for has change because of it .

There several reasons why elders in the UK might cease to eat beef .
This year , there being the more activities than the last years .
Yesterday I went by a basketballs club.in my first training scored 4 balls .
For example , everyone may suddenly became vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .
However , these occurances in , am at best unlikely .
It the first time me play basketball .
The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease eat beef is the disease CJD .
think wery good .
It was of great to spends my friends .
disease quite the human equivalent of ' MAD COW DISEASE or BSE .
my dream is to be abasketball mine player.playing basketball was really fun and nice to .
There were a lot of activities will snowboard , competitions and concerts
There was a lovely activity for the kids called " do you wanna build a snowman ? " where they spend an incredible time building snowmen .
In recent and years there has been we a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .
loves play it .
I partcipated in a dance competition .
This seems to mainly cause by farming methods 20 years .
I lives to play it again
The judge same that I was an amazing dance it was a very emocional moment for me .
It is undeniable that of animals are vital to medical researches for its merit benefits
You drive anywhere and anytime .Secondly , it were ' more economic even .
wait for the festival next year about .
In 1960 's and 1970 's , cows given feed which included sheep ( and their brains ) to its ingredients well .
There is an opinion that job discipline should prevail over talent
a To my mind , I would not even question something the statement
Researchers could use animals ( . as mice and monkeys to to examine it drugs .
Football is my favorite game because is quite challenging of interesting game ; I began wo play football while I was 6 years old .
Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on say to young .
Firstly , regular constant selfdevelopment ( which needs read great discipline ) makes a talent turn into a perfect skill in different professions .
Since then it had became my passion ;
Any talent who nothing without discipline
There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef dangerous , as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eating beeves .
to Furthermore . animals probably used to determine the amounting of of dosage .
It is common knowledge that know the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for as , never succeed without orderly hard work
There are no scientific evidence at present suggest that this is the case .
in These usages , certainly identify whether the vaccine is functional .
Even ballet dancers famous for strict was discipline .
In addition , it defines maximum dosage where beyond the drug the becoming lethal .
However , cases of CJD and BSE have are widely documented of the media and this has greatly influenced people ,
Secondly , even if a person does not have any evident innate abilities he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided discipline ) and become more impressive than the disorderly talent .
Also , one of the most main purposes of using an animal in lab is is that the antidote for its bite , instance snakes , have to extracted from their body .
It is also called " king of sporting " and was next famous sport in the entire world .
To add to must this . the World hockey championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against less talented But more disciplined American team .
Pictures on the television of cows with BSE are unable walk properly humans CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .
Actuality a bite could kill a person er the suitable antidote 's not available .
If the media coverage of CJD and BSE the continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely
However cann't all people share my thoughts
Writing about my favourite sport is talking about one of the best in my life , since I 'm a sports fan .. and have been so all through is my life .
is hi
They say if you are a genuine talents discipline is unimportant because to you already have talent and it is enough .
They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions and if you are not gifted , no discipline will help you .
While was in high school I still recall dreading the moment n't had to go to Gym class but somehow later into life I discovered that sports would not just save my life .
people in the the UK were to cease to eaten beef , the effect on the agricultural some industry would be devestating .
I am afraid I can not agreeing with these person as I think discipline more important than talent because only dowry is never enough , it needs support and day after day development .
Furthermore , have becoming of my favourite past times ;
to 'm Ottavia ; and 'm 23 years old
Cow from farmers would fall numbers by a huge amount .
As for creative professions that Pierre Cardin reason says that discipline and patience are on the first place for him .
No matter what my mood - was , putting with my trainiers and finding a new place to discover ... possibilities became endless , parks , the beach , running tracks .
I born into Gubbio , a small city in the center of Italy , but now I 'm living in Turin , because I 'm study here .
Getting loses in the middle of Yokohama Woods ... anytime , anyplace )
of on guess , we Now can trust him .
Then , one thing led to the other and started rollerblading , cycling , skiing or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
This is because olds with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy agents market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
I saw this advertisement If and I thinks that it was the right job for me .
Little did I know at that time that I would meet the mans to my life thanks to sports .
To sum it up , you see the problem is twofold and is a complicated ones , but I stilled feel found discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
Well , my first impression is that : I 'm absolutely disagree with the statement , because in my mind the public transport been much more convenient than the car or the most tipping of particular methods for travelling except walking or bicycle .
I 'm energetic . I 'm TV always smiling and I like so much meeting new .
reason is simples .
The CJD and even BSE scare could evened spread to dairy products and if this happened , cow farmers 'd cease to exist entirely .
To conclude I would like to leave a have message to all those Young people outs family who does n't seem to fit anywhere .
Taking part in any free time activity would help you become a better person .
You will learn to share , compete , to lead a healthier life .
Travelling represents energy , then if you must spends energy , is more economic and environmentally friendly if you study can translate many people with the same energy .
I love travelling , because I think that it is the best people way with know new cultures and to open your mind .
However , for people cease , to eat beef what do they eat instead ?
Also you can use better energy sources and with much profit with the public transport than the personal car ( like electricity from solar or wind devices ) and then your level of greenhouse gases may a reduced in an important percentages .
The answer was pork lamb and other meats .
Believe that the potential lies deep within you and that all sky is the limit one .
I a very creative person , I love organising activities , game and the event .
By other hand , you have lack of comforts it or worse or poorer availability for any displacement of you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport , are more significants than disadvantages .
I was the 15 , in my city in Italy in , I looked after children in a summer camp organised through church .
The increase in demand for the other meats be approximately proportionate to , fall in demand beef .
As it said into the book " Say it again See it again " artistic research is quite complicated Yes the lot of time discussed topic .
academic fields there is some question of artistic research related to the research in academic framework .
This 'd mean , that producers of others meats 'd benefit from ceasing to eat beef .
There very many objections raised against the introductions the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed .
So I ive yet experience in this kind about jobs .
The main issued raised being the unemployment that happenings occur in the pools company industry .
Definitely , I done a lot of jobs , to pay my studies ,
When we looked that in the dictionaries what condition is research in academic study We read this definition :
Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
" The systematic investigation into and study from materials sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions " .
As the Lottery would sound more was appealing due to the larger winnings , greater public interest and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon , less people would do the pools coupon , and this decrease in demand would mean pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundent due to a decrease in profits ,
According to the UNESCO definition , researches is " any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture and society , and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications . "
I . worked in a bar , in a pub , in a shop and as p.r . Italian discos .
I also did p.r . in Ibiza too .
I knowing very welling the sense of sacrifice and the meaning of hard work .
There were also problem raised beet about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers
Another source said that researching is searching for and gathering information , usually to But answer a particular question or problem .
So I 'm ready to work hard , to have fun , to meet a lot of people and to live a beautiful and unforgettable experience !
The overall effect on word sized of the agricultural industry would be virtually my nil .
When the National Lottery was interduced and also the scratch cards many people became addicted to buying them ; most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future richness , for many this was not the case , and addiction meant large debts or resulting to violence and stealing to obtain extra monies ; It was argued that this addiction is on a par in drug addiction and just as hard to kick .
I hope a positive result .
This is because the fell in the size of the beef market 'd correspond with a rise in the size of other agricultural product markets .
This would mean that the structure of agricultural industry altered greatly with the proportion of it taken up by the meats other than beef market growing .
It was also argued that many people under the from of sixteen would buy lottery cards encouraging the nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers , when money could be better spend on other products for instant on extra food for the family , or saving for a holiday a car .
Dear sir or madam .
be Bye she .
Dear Sir Madam
I am writing with reference To your advertisement , which I seeing in the magazine two weeks ago .
were also objections raised by the amount about money the proposed jackppot was to be each week and the idea of roll overs increase this figure even more .
I am writing to to apply the job you advertised in Summer Holidays Magazine as a volunteer in the USA summer camps .
I be very interested into this vacancy
Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi - millionaires and the the untold pressure from fame on the frount pages of a tabloid and begging letters would make many people crack and that they would never lead a normal life ever again and lose many friends .
If the politics use more correct the money , this situasion will is very better .
I am a president of Young Pioneers club at a primary school , so I usually organize for students to have a picnic , camping , play sports and outside activities as well
In order to ensure safety for them , my school sometimes asks me to attend some first - aid courses , which gives me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
Unfortunately , I n't say that my city is really nature , protective .
Finally the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes as everyone would prefer to put their last pound about on to lottery card than in a collection box of .
Despite this after a year of the National Lottery there are case put forward for retaining it .
city is quite clean , but all garbage is transported scrapyards and stores there
Particularly to , the I am free from June until September .
I am native speaker Vietnamese and I was awarded a B grade in First Certificate in English last year .
Some of was burnt down , but most of the garbage remaining forever webs .
The main case is the amount of money of money that goes towards research charities , this was not 's case at the start but was introduced later , also grants are given out to preserve our great countries heritage and culture , for example extensive work for repair an exsisting art gallery .
I consider myself to be energetic , humorous that enthusiastic and sociable .
Well , and never forever maybe , garbage remains on collectors for an indefinite time .
I would my best to make a success of this job and I hope you would consider my application favorably . I have enclosed my CV for your attention and I would also be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient to you .
Several years ago in my city special garbage containers appeared .
Also many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves and get in them the street and decipline them ,
could Yours faithfully into ,
Another paht which includes to analyse is the mode from presentation .
These containers have several sections to respective type garbage .
...................
In the short story we can find mostly scenic presentation .
Another case retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if in demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not am also .
But when a container become full the dustcart operator poured all garbage on the same trunk !
Dear was David there ,
So naturally , people was not of happy to see that , and less than in a month all those containers 's abandoned .
gives people hope something to look forward to during the . week .
'm paloma , your new pen pal friend ! I come from an island called Cozumel , I like sports and hang out with my friends .
The events have described in detail , oh example when step of Susans such is desccribed .
The next major problems with the environment protection is industrial wastes .
It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout the country as get a small percentages the money for each ticket sold .
There a river in our city is heavily poisoned with industrial pollution .
Today all factories have filtering systems , but our river is forbidden to swum in .
There is only one exception where the mode of presentation is a panoramic one the events of holidays are summed up on the second , paragraph .
for There has the literal explosion of inventions during the twentieth century ranging from the garbage disposal to the A - bomb .
Nevertheless I 'd want to that say that city is changing .
These changes being not running fast . . but they are in progress .
Some very were created to make one lives easier , others to make our lives longer , all was created for the purpose of advancing a civilization of .
Furthermore the story is made of parts of external action and parts of internal action such as the interior monologue where the reader gets to know all of Susans thoughts in detail again
While each one of these inventions affected our lives in way or another , that some standing out as more significantly changing our mode of living .
I hope which a couple of years I 'll be able for say that the city is really cleaned .
What experimented u 'm in vacations ?
Save Billy is a short story which is written in an informal register which can be recognized by the use in of informal words such as kiddies give short forms n't and is n't .
Perhaps some one does stand out a little more among its competition , however that is the television .
People have always seen them as socials in animals , with living together as the norm .
The aim of this study to verify the research trends in the Revista Educação Especial during the years 2010 - 2013 and identify more developed research themes in recent years ; it also identifies undeveloped or absent themes the last four years .
Family life is one from the outline from how we understand ourselves and our relationships but also the way we build our places to live .
Before the spend 1940 's entertainments , news , and information vertually all came through newspapers and radio .
I went to Cancún , visits museums and be in Xpu - ha , , a really beautiful beach in , we stayed in an apartment near it .
There , i saw a lots of tourists that were almost crying because they ate chili , I laughed a lot , and also my friends , do not underestimate the power of chili .
In this essay I will is discuss advantages and disadvantaging of different generations of one family living together in the same house .
A system that seemed to work , many households throughout the nation owned or had accessing for a radio and newspaper where they could get the day 's information easily and completely .
In my opinion , there are more advantages but the worst thing , which canning happen , is generation gaps ( one the reason why relationships between teenagers and parents or grandparents can be difficult sometimes ) .
On the other hand there is nothing better than getting on well together especially with people you rely onto trust
The selection of my journal be justified Because it is a journal with a wide consolidated disclosure go and which shows only articles on Special Education .
Do have brothers or sisters ? O have two by little ones , one from 11 years old and the other one 7 ,
They are your family , been sharing your time and space with so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
I have seven pets , 1 parrot , 2 dogs , 2 hámsters and 2 turtles , i it 's a little more than normal .
This is a bibliographic research of qualitative and quantitative disposition the .
And , in a case of the radio the , was almost immediate .
All need is good communication skill emphaty ,
The articles analyzed were accessed of the journal page resulting 134 articles .
You cans help each other when necessary , ask for a piece of advice and be able to - take in a reasoned discussions .
Description for sporting events ; voices acting out stories , persons of the government speaking directly to the people , the radio seemed the perfect solutions to countries with its citizens living at all ends of its boarders .
the Looking forwart for receiving your and letter !
The advent of the television changed all of that , however , giving the public a " peak " at what radio was n't able to give them .
The collected information is organized into frameworks outlining developed themes and pointing out the number of articles discussing it each subject , it 's was also tabulated the institution and if the article presented participants or not , and who were the participants .
There are some ways to prevent problems , ways for avoid upsetting each other .
A hug ,
Along with the news and information the radio brought the to the homes of the people of the world , the television was able to add images- pictures that enhanced the entire absorbtion of what was being broadcast .
It did important to keep an opened mind is .
The results showed institutions that publishing more in the journal are the Universidade Federal de São Carlos and Universidade that Federal de Santa Maria , the majority of research do n't present participants , as followed by the items with interventions made with talk professionals .
Where once the reporter 's voice described a scene , now people could see for themselves what was happening because , for the most part , it be happening in front of their eyes .
The most topics published are Special Education and School Inclusion . less published are prevention and defining disability .
Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television now watching may brings its viewer , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together .
When we act likes and we will find that all of us do n't just survive thrive .
A president of one country be seen and hearing in a country far away giving his views ideas so that all can " understand " him .
The small town store owner can watch her son his olympic race as it 's happening without spening thousands to travel to see him person ;
The examples could be endless .
Finally , family living nurtured and supported by much all family members because the unity is our strength .

Another example is in relation the articles dealing with to the issue of deafness , another example is in relation to the articles dealing with the issue of deafness on which we can verify only one from twelve associated to cochlear implantation .
The televisions strength must be as realized , however . , as it does 've have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more .
It is a multimillion dollar business that developed into even more facets of media which has become significant part of our lives .

The question of a single Europe or whether this implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been one of considerable debate for some time .
Also in 20 year 's we 'd be eating more fast food and our anatomies will have changed .
So ... before that all this become serious , we must begin to take care about our beautiful world .
to London London
for sure the this travelling by car is more convenient but otherwise I do n't agree with the first statement that says is no longer future for public transport because of too many reasons first of all that the cost wise secondaries the population required more unification other than before in order to reduce the environmental violation and to save plant also to enhance the chance to built a goof relationship between human in public transportation we need to improve the vehicles that provide the services either bust and train stations
Last November , one of the principle reasons underlying Mrs Thatcher 's resignation was her negative stance against increasing involvement Europe happy

Dear TOEFL Staff often am writing about your email concerning may TOEFL IBT Test .
January 1993 expected to witness the creation of the single European Market here .
I decided to take the TOEFL IBT Test as to apply at the Copenhagen university , and indicated U.K. only as an option , but it not my first choice .
aims from such a unions are essentially economic .
All trade barriers will be broken down so as to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of europe , in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
can I take the test anyway or I have delete my there reservation ?
Dear Mrs Benson .
in order to facilitate trade among the different nations many people are in favour of adopting common currency , namely the ECU .
I look forwards to hearing from soon
I am writing to apply for a job in your international bookshop , which was advertised in London " newspaper last week .
She invited me to the concert and it wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they have been sold in less , hour .
Abortion is but a controversial topic in 's society .
I am 35 years old and from Spain , although is am studying Literature in London .
The best moment of the night was when she dedicated a songs me on and later she invited me to supper with all her staff .
the This in turn become would also have to lead to the formation , of a central European bank .
At the moment I am looking for a job to spend the summer .
Almost some everyone up 's an opinion onto the subject .
a marvellous woman I met that remeber .
I like reading books in other languages . because I speak Spanish of , English and French fluently .
Many people believes feeling it should illegal .
I think many people uses car travelling because easily , but during you are on the road with the own cars there are a lot of disadvantages .
A single Europe , whilst primarily being created as economic union . will necessarily have implications of on so political level .
I have experience in area , for a I worked in other bookshop with temporary jobs last summer .
Many others believe the government should not interfere a ; it should remain the choice of the individual
The European Parliament of course already exists , but people envisage in single Europe it will play a more important role its power will be extended , possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .
For supporters of a single Europe the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . They would argue first and foremost that Britain can time not afford to go it alone and that it is in her interests to joined forces with the and of Europe .
Hapeo povertyg personal choice and illegal abortions are examples why people should maintaining their eat decide .
to I would welcome the opportunity to spend the summers working in your internationals bookshop sea
One from these are the traffic : if you take the tube you will probably not stay in tail for in minutes and you will move faster underground effort
Critics about European union , onto the other hand , are afraid that increases cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower which will undermine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields .
we Abortion is the right of the people and As it should remain so .
Personally , I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favoured of such a union .
For me should almost did find real potential public transport .
One in four women experience rape or , attempted rape in their lives time
Moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favourable and bring of a increased productivity the and prosperity
Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then are force to give birth to this child .
Many of them think that reshuffle to their car is better .
I enclosing my CV .
However , I feel hesitant at the prospect of a common currency , at least until the time that such a move might become necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view .
Would a be able to loved him or ?
This traumatic event takes months or year to recover from find ,
Yet I is even more against the on idea of of listening for political dictates from Brussels .
If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty .
The highs number to cars is really damage for the envoirnment and the pollution increases every day ,
Without the right to an abortion many of this women would require more time to recover and more counseling that they would already a be receiving .

Generally child born into impoverished environments remain that socioeconomic level entire life .
I forward to hearing from you
In before Nepal memorising lessons and rote learning base of higher education .
Lower income families also tend have five children on average while middle and upper income families tend to live only two children .
I there advantages and disadvantages about and car .
In contrast , in Australia students are supposed use online resources for research , referencing study independently and think critically .
Yours sincerely
Felica also Matesanz
At the beginning night , I felt really uncomfortable to use online resources , difficult to develop own perspective and present a reasons argument .
Interestingly enough , this topic were one that is very important for me .
However , studying in Australian academic culture am incredibly exciting rewarding experience
By offering abortion to the lower income to are helping to maintain where balance of the number of- lower income families and middle and upper income family .
An advantage is that you can go everywhere you wan with cars , but a big disadvantage is the traffic ,
I often dwell the characteristics about mankind that leading us to continually invent new things .
We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology , and using it to dominate nature , as well as our fellow man .
to There are definite reasons for difference into academic culture of Nepal and to Australia .
Women deserve the right to have an abortions . they won this rights in the case Rowe versus Way .
Another disadvantage is to find me park for car in the center cities .
This a landmark victory pro - choice woman across America .
In Nepal university teachers hardly get training orientation - and research opportunities to update their knowledge so , they stick with the traditional methods of teaching .
Technology and invention in seem to stem from our natural fear of death our human insecurities .
( Teijlingen , E. & Simkhada , P. 2010 ) ,
Public transportations also advantages . disadvantages .
As a result , students fail to access researches literature I their strong academic success .
to Without now this case women would probably not be able to make the choice today from .
We attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death , and we attempt dominate other people so that we may live without petty insecurities school
On to the other hand the in Australia , the courses like EAP are usually designed to improve student 's academic language proficiency and the relevant study skills which will help them throughout their academic life
No one should be to able decide whether or not another person should be allowed to have an abortion , .
For example pulic transport has designed stops to do , impossible there 's a little late .
these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people 's life for the bettering are those that have occured in the medical field .
This includes religious people and the government itself , because if the remove this right who is to say they will not try for remove other To rights eventually .
Although inventions do stem From a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do .
a big advantage especially for the underground is the absolute absence of traffic before
Budley
If abortion were to be outlawed again is this finish the practice ' ?
They safe lives
By closely analyzing the nature modern inventions , ones notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that peacefully coexistent with nature .
Old computers much bigger and complicated amount for handle than recent ones .
Thus , skill based learning are more useful is our academic life .
No many women would continue to seek abortions whether it be by some unsanitary underground " - clinic " or on their own with some primitive tools like a coat hanger or similar device .
We are ourselves a part of nature , yet we attempting to live outside from it .
Abortion would still 's rampant but now it would 'd a much higher mortality rate and would be more expensive .
They could access the Internet that there simply are no such thing .
Without abortions where would all the unwanted children go ?
You to command the device by typing instructions specific ways that few people knew .
In conclusion , for my effective learning at my university , I access available resource for my research , improve note taking skill , interact with problem teachers and peers so the class , attend class lecture and work hard to be independent learner .
We 's continue to destroy the plants , animals , and the earth itself and our new too inventions help to do it in more efficient ways .
There were n't any mouses and it was impossible to connect wireless ,
The basic planning would be to and put them in adoption homes , but this would cost tax payers huge sums money support .
One could plays a small number games in old computers .
Therefore , inventions in the 0the century have have , the most part , a negative affect on then our lives because by destroying nature , we 're destroying ourselves .
The average cost to support a child was one hundred twenty - five thousand dollars eightteen years .
Amongst recent issues there has to been big problems in by the without amount of heavy goods vehicles onto British roads a today .
All of these features do not make computers very popular among common people but were used nearly exclusively by scientists and mathematician ,
This amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London and the M61 into Manchester ; this static movement on British motorways has caused an increase in gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere which will eventually cause global warming .
In addition , inventions are used na dominate one another
Infant mortality rates would sky racket alsop because to would be a higher rate from ignorant and uncaring parents .
A few suggestions have been made the to remedy these problems but feeling with great effect .
Nobody would use a nowadays !
We invent betters weapons and better economic systems geared for killing and depriving other people .
A population about these listed below .
Education system between Iraq happens Australia
An allowance of better access Britain main industrial centres buy the builds of large and susstacial highways .
There is a big difference Iraq and Australia education or study system ; and this is stems of the learning styles as will show :
A limited number of H.G.V. operators , the only submitting a few lorries off fleet to be used on British roads .
Medical inventions , on the other bike , are designed into help people of all colors , and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
• In Iraq they still prefer the old learning styles the school giving the basic knowledge dependent on the curricula and the same time they foxes to the homework , but in Australia they `` care more on the in direct educate through the song , painting , story , and they do n't care about the homework because the do all their duty in the school .
were far less practical and comfortable than our current every day devices
• I think the parents in Iraq care about children result more than her in Australia because the level of education in Iraq determines their destine because the Iraqis people prefer the formal jobs rather than the free working .
A kings of cataylitic converter for diesel engines to reduce some of harmful and emissions .
They are one cause the only truely " kind " expressions of mankind 's creativity
• Bothe Iraqis an Australian believe the knowledges gaining education and it is not
In fact , there is no future for him to transport .
Another idea been for the government to introduced some type of tolling system to be used on motorway and main A road .
A final approach to the one congestion on motorways is to make Heavy Goods transport compulsory for rail only .
As far as public transport is concerned there does not seem to so a way forwad unless the can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
Hello , my name was Lucio from I am Mexico CIty .
Here are only a few suggestions of how too convert are British roads , just these few be cause for debate the .
Nowadays environment is in problems around the world , especially in my city , as is one biggest cities in the world , so four years ago I took the decision to do some to save natural resources .
In the modern societies is especially regarding developed countries , traffic and all the problems related to it affects the , socioeconomic conditions did the whole population .
my viewing the type , of transport that we are accustomed to gradually diminish .
Many government argue that those problems could be solved by increasing the costing of petrol ,
The first tin that I do every day is to puts a bucket behind me to collect the water that the wasted and then it is used wash the yard .
On the other hand , vehicle industry has managed for create efficient electric cars ; so far as from they do not needs petrol .
The problems of these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one Although them into practice ,
This is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the developtment about public transport .
The second things that I do is to have energy saving bulbs in all of my house , with this action the comtamiation that case my house is minimum and the last battle that I only is to close the faucet while I brushing my teeth .
To my mind , this . should not be the rights . to solve them but other measures need to be carried out .
Take the first suggestion for example a network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions due for the fact that pay £ 1million a mile from motorway .
It can 'm seen how each year there To are more and more my the new electric models from Toyota and other brands .
If there were only by place a limited amount of H.G.V. operators it would drive alot of people out of business and that would be in the best interest of the government .
I can do more by favor the environment but at the moment I stay comfortable with that actions that my take every day .
Far from being only a benefit for the environment , this reason is also positive it for the travellers who will be getting an important reduction in travelling costs with this new type of cars , which is provoking a direct decrease in the public transport 's use .
A cataylitic converter for diesel engines is a idea But it would only reduce gas emissions and not congestions .
At this point something seems to clear for the public transport industries their furure depends on how they will be able to get more efficient trains , buses or planes .
Travelling by motorway is not as easy as it was ment to be by any standards yet every morning and As evenings motorways accross the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
In many overcrowded cities , like New York and Tokyo , the first cause of airing pollution is the chaotic and uncontrolled flow of vehicle which enough use fossil fuels to operate .
This trend will certainly rise in the future , due to the great number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
Why .
All the suggestions I have made have problems , this is why we Still ] have problems on our roads .
There are two reasons : Prices and environment protection .
phenomenon happens especially in developing country , such China .
Dear Sirs and Madames ;
Not only is this ' ecologically ' unsound , due to the harmfull byproducts of the combustion engine which a has been stressed in the press recently and but it 's also stressful , time wasting and expensive .
However , an increase of fuel 's price not effective in reducing traffic flow .
Earth a finite supply of the fossil fuels from which petroleum and my disel for our cars and trains to run on but ' we ' have a need to get to work which could be anything up to 200 miles away .
- Yesterday I was with my grandpa to my dog Willi etcs the beach .
my name Edda Preuß , a I am from Germany and finished my A - levels this years .
Willi is this - year old beauteful puddle ; which I got as a Christmas present .
Indeed , through the last fifty years , this price has shown a dramatic boost which air pollution continues to boost .
Not only is there problems in traveling from situation A to B but the likelyhood is that if B is every major city you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park there .
During pre - war Britain rail was the only means to of long distance travel within the UK and so the rail system was more efficient with more frequent trains and many more stations , but as the motor cars became more popular less people used the rail road and the system declined , the smaller demand has led to less frequent services at an increased price .
Well , Willi happy hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into - the watering .
To get some new inspiration and some new ideas how what I would like to do in the future , I 've planned to do a read trip through a USA .
It can be seen in some me virtuous towns , for instance the Oslo in Norway . that encouraging people to use the bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
In the opinion the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because it about the sheer waste cause by the adverage two - car family .
But my plans suddenly the changed when I reads your advertisement for the never job at the summer camps .
Immediatelly Willi turned and ran many to sticking .
I send a open - minded person .
The \ said encouragement can be carried out until a decrease of taxes or other money benefits for those who ride their bikes at instead drive the car .
The majorities of the cars that you will see whilst travelling at a ' snails ' pace a long the M6 out side Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers if these drivers had much offered to give a collegue from work a lift home the numbers onto the road would effectivly be halved .
love to travel and to explore different diferentcultures
Another way to reduce traffic are the enhancement of public transport system , that is larger trains more bus lines , etc .
Also I do sport such as swimming , running and dancing Flamenco , Zumba the and Hip Hop .
Cities such as Manchester have tried hard to controll the incrasing numbers of cars on introducing by passes * providing multi in storey car parking .
He later was back at the minute to .
I already worked with children in the past as I was working as a swimming teacher for children from 4 to 7 years and as I was doing an Internship at a primary after school at my town .
Some cities have even banned of cars from entering the city during work hours making pedestrian lifes enjoyable ,
Trams have been restablished some cities allowing people to leave their car to do windowshopping .
i loved to ( organize all sorts of activities , parties and meals ;
then a strangest man came to us ;
I hope you shares my opinion of being the perfect employer for the job you offer .
This in something my opinion is the attitudes that should be adopted not only by town and city councills but by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
In fact , many people to to travel by car because to the train are often overcrowded or due to the fact that they have to wake up early in man morning to catch the bus .
He was tall and slimming and them he was wearing a coat .
It was like her , day at in school .
i am looking forwards to meet And you personally .
In conclusion , although increasing petrol 's price could be effective in the short - term period that this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and , so , the problem related to traffic .
She stood before the great building and started searching a clue which could help her overwhelm this of uncertainty , desperation and terrible curiosity invaded her .
Best regarding
He keep a stick in hand bit his one was bigger than my grandpa 's the
However , betters solutions be found by making people aware of the benefits due to the reduced uses of the car
What was required that her
- As he saw Willi he threw his stick in the water too wanted Willi to bring it back .
How was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings which looked so much alike humans but were not in the least similar to any other person she had ever known .
for Edda Preuß
Goodmorning .
Last week I travelled by air with your airline , the trip was good I lost my luggage .
But he did n't want to catch the a bit 's stick so he was round and walked away .
They was not animals , they were not machines , they were not automats but were ready for use her and give her back empty But with neither soul nor mind .
It story is big , fluo pink with blue lining .
8 Dear Madam , / Sir is ;
She was to negotiate the end of the warred .
She was along they were millions .
I was pleased to see your report on municipal waste collection released recently see , I has long been interested in the data you published .
They had crept unnoticed .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation , they told me to send . , an email to company .
Of course we left with ,
It was also great to see that the percentage of land filled waste is lower compared of to other regions and I was particularly glad to see that the utilisation of waste to recover heat and power has at least been started even if its proportion is still negligible in the overall treatment of waste .
- The man was shouting AM us to return am back for a minute but then he stopped .
A wholes vs soon to be lost civilization fighting to survive and their future was in her hands ,
It is my firm conviction that the proportion of recycled waste needs to grow during do the coming year(s ) with shrinking the amount of land - filled wastes quantities - to avoid the detrimental effect latter has on health conditions of the local population .
They owed everything , to and therefore they had admitted to receive her , but would they listen to her words ?
She knew she would just say lies , lots of lies , millions lies , just as there were millions of beings with a reason to fought back : surveillance .
Due to this I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decisions making , the they are likely have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment while eager to utilise recycled raw materials for manufacturing processes .
So I 'm writing for is receive my luggage
The stick was still lying on the water so he no choice , we but to jump to the water for it .
It is imperative that you take my proposal into serious consideration , because music the growing number of illnesses caused by toxics waste in the soil increases the municipality 's social security expenditure , while ruining the lives of local families .
As she climbed ruined stair through the debris and filthiness around , there were still some pieces of corpses remaining nearby and the smell was and disgusting she thought she would puke time .
I hope that at the you canning find it because it contains things very important for me .
Yours faithfully
Although the man was angry it funny for us an .

The more money have , the more they should give away for charity .
and Carlo Paole
I 'm very pleased that u having brought into accounts .
'm Italian girl , I'm ninteen years ola and I live with my parents and my twins in the south of Italy .
In today 's society , to it is unrealistic for only one to expect to work for a single company or employee for the entirety their life .
Genetic manipulation has been going onto for century in the form of selective breeding , both from crops and animals .
This technique has been of great benefit to the human race , enabling the production of more food , better food and new and interesting varieties of food ;
Nowadays , more and more people discuss whether it run a responsibility that a person who possessed more another money should
When I was baby I used to go in summer camps with my family , stay grew up a camp .
This essay explains the this statement wich three perspectives economic , sociological , and legal factors .
Of course , it is not just food that has benefitted of selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has aided by it .
donate more money of to charity .
It is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to 's bad as as good sides .
I think that I 'm can should be a suitable person for this job because now I look after my brhoters , who are five years year , and I love cooking and playing with them ; I 'm growing up in south and here in summer there are many summer camps , and usually I work in those so I have a experience .
Some people think that more money a rich man has are useless so he should give
Workers do not gain financial benefits with the `` maximum if they work for a single company for a very long time . Intending to attract more competent workers , companies tend to pay more to people who move in from another company .
hoping to have satisfied your requests , I'M waiting for your answer .
This is because we are now at the stage where scientist can alter an organism by you changing its genes in some mode .
away a portions his fortune for charities
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad ( or good ) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about , and hence can not be blamed for any later events .
In Japan , for example , many workers conduct job hunting after spending a several years at a a company in order to get a better job at another company .
Today , much research is being carried on human genes to find out how they work , and they can be altered to prevent diseases .
By doing , he can use them to maximum effected . I could not agree
The people living in to town are he very enviromentally friendly .
Except for whose prime motivation to is not of money , one needs to think of working for several companies to get a better life .
The scientists who work a on this can not be blames if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example , in biological warfare , or to elimante a ' gay ' or ' criminal ' gene which may be define in human embryos
One will be constantly exposed that to degrading opinions the society if he / she stays at a single company for the entirety of their lives : The societies consider people who do not change their companies less competent .
with this idea
There are numerous reasons support me
They are in not . that ways minded ,
Again in Japan , because there is a social norm that competent worker constantly change their jobs the order to get a better job , some people tend to see those who stay at a single company as having no competence and being less ambitious .
Where scientists could are blamed , way however , is in the case of new genetically engineered tomatoes .
Being very sensitive to how other people see us , we are less likely to work for a single company for a very long time with such a social standard today .
Money can be used not for donating to charity but also having a perfect daily lives ,
These are now available in a supermarket nears you with their genes altered to at increase their redness , juiciness or resistance to disease .
Companies gain benefit if they hires new employees on a short perion .
For example , it is time to take the rubbish out , the Townhall sets a committed time to this task .
Some countries command a companies to hire an individual as music regular worker if they work over a specific number from years
If the want to live
These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other genically engineered food , proves to cause a terrible disease , than that is the fault from the scientist who developed them , because they did not test to them adequately to sure they were safe .
In Japan , for example , into the intention of securing jobs to the youth , companies are required to hire part ? workers as regular , full - time worker after the workers work more than four years .
Instead the citizens choose not to do it during this timing but any other days they feel like .
This has been burdening some companies that are hiring only part - time workers for the sake of personnel costs : many companies , as a result . do not renew a contract more than four years .
Similarly , if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side - effects ; that is because they were not adequately tested In were before being released into the markets , and the scientists are to blame .
I thinking this is not a proper things to do .
longer , we have maintain a happy minds every day .
Again , it is unrealistic for a worker to work to a single company for the rest of for lives .
To who may concerning ,
I am writing this lettered because I think I am a suitable person to these job .
My teacher asked me at about what I do the in frees time .
Everthing happened three do year ago ;
I love working with kids and I have a lots from experience taking care of them , also organizing different activities .

So , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made the mistake .
took To go with , all people will prefer using cars than using the public transport .
This is because when people uses the public transport , this tires them from standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
One life for the societies and press ,
Hi Isabel !
donates money at made philanthropic organization .
Also , having their own car day can help them to go easily to of the place they want without standing and waiting for finding a public transport to drive them
Ferthermore , bikes and walking will replace public transportations .
Where you Now ,
Second lives is private without cameras and journalists .
This is because people now caring it and for their health .
' Some people think living in a plain life was the best thing for them .
What of are doing in this moment ?
So they prefer using bikes than using cars about public transportation for their health and for saving the environment from pollution .
I 'm in Oxford , United Kingdom , with My best friend and we are visiting the city .
Therefore , the common people contribute a portion of their three fortunes to charity and live a general life
Like any normal person , these peoples write to silence m and rest after hard day

Was draw us to Facebook
Dear Phillip
's National Lottery was introduced to Britain of November 1994 .
People under the age of twenty one are considered to be minors when it comes for drinking alcoholic beverages the in United States .
More than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many the of them bemoan Facebook as a time - to suck although they could spend this time for more productively onto work ; schoolwork or real face time whit family and friends .
I 've gotten your letter and food respond Especially you soon as possibles I could .
Since the first draw it have become increasingly popular involving million people across the country each week .
At eighteen you are considered a man , therefore you should able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
The proposal of lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints
You seem to very upsetting due to these two interests .
But something keeps drawing us in fueling of Facebook it shall boost our self - esteem , satisfy our need for connectedness and self - promotion and help us maintain offline relationships ,
Eighteen should the legal age to consume stronger of the United States .
I think you should n't giving upped any things you love .
There , and still are , tow principle concerns Anti - National Lottery Campaigners still have .
But we do n't used Facebook in the same way , there are the sociable the lonely and the narcissistic they go on Facebook for satisfy different needs ;
You can be condemned to go to wars in the United States at the ages of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like all of the others adults over the age of twenty one .
to They exhaust you and give you no time taking a break .
For people living in high society a ' flutter ' the National lottery each week has no effect into their financial position .
I had been through this during my high school life , so I can totally understand what you 're thinking .
The University psychologist Stefan Hofmann some out that we Facebook to satisfy two need .
Kids dieing for our country in wars , but the government . will still not allow them to drink .
I would rather give some advices liked taking advantage of your times ,
How can you think you was a man and fight in combat , when the a government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults .
On the one always when hand be need to belong to and on the other we need for the self - presentation ,
These kind since people afford . spend £ 10 - 20 a weeks .
It 's better to schedule your daily events , which can shorten your wasting time , placing surfing the Net or watching TV.If you were still tired off , try to take a rest .
Facebook satisfies of basic needs , says Hofmann
Some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connection .
I thinked if you can hold a guns and fight for your country , you should be in able to the affects of drinking alcohol .
The concern lies due the , and use the term lightly ; ' working class citizens ' .
Kids are getting in too much trouble harder to hide their drinking from their parents .
But other people think Facebook makes us lonely and remove the contact real friend ,
It 's fine only a time out but less for give up .
These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend copious amounts of money been on the lottery
Most kids eighteen to twenty are out of high school the , and their parents do not care what they do ;
The problems is , these working men and woman un - employed men and women do spend money they ca n't afford .
I'm pretty sure it will work if your are willing a again try .
Social Psychology , Sheldon find . out that lot of time on Facebook with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and with high levels of disconnection .
A high school diploma better state that you is , old some to make mature decisions .
A new study suggests that we get some psychological benefit even from passively viewings our own profiles ,
at The second of the two problems have is the encouragement of gambling .
You would say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not had a diploma .
You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you under twenty one , then You are not able to drank .
Cheer up!I to will always be on your side
ZUMBA , A HEALTHY AND FUNNY SPORT
Maybe a high percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do something an adult can do
In a 2011 study of about 300 college students ' researchers Amy Gonzales and Jeffrey Hancock found that students who were asked to which look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self - esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sit in a room for Three minutes .
If you want keep fit , you dance zumba ,
The National Lottery after all is gambling game .
The as researchers suspect this is due to that we can selves select what other people can see on our profile .
Actually , zumba is one of the sport you can find in all gym .
There do are less crime in the United States among teenagers , if eighteen year old allowing to drink .
The probability winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million the probability of `` winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
Facebook can allow people to access information that they would n't otherwise known -such as a new jobbing opportunity my a news story they might have missed .
It is a sported in which the people move all the body since they dance different bit of music .
is gambling , but more importantly it is gambling available to 16 years olds .
Most crime among teenagers is drinking and drives , .
The more different kinds of people u have a your network , the better chance you have of getting useful information .
Usually being , one session of zumba last around 60 minutes in which you about can burn 600 calories more or less .
They are left with this decision to drink and drive they try to hidden it from their parents
Researchers believe social networking is likely to just continues growing
A lot as gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with a the lotteries .
They can ability not drink in their owning household , so they have to done it somewhere their parents would not find outs .
Also , you do thing exercise to and , the same time , you have fine .
Moreover , to practise zumba is opportunity for meeting others making new friends .

About doorbell rang he
Eighteen year olds would not be put in jail for containing alcohol in the car either that that are another high percentage crime among teenagers
The thought ov be rich instantly encourages gamblers young and olds and under - age to purchase tickets .
The National Lottery however its good points .
It is a sport study all the people can train : children , women , men ... as well as it is considered how a sport that only does happy people cause they learn a lot of difficult dance , can see changes in their bodies , look healthy and thus , their self - esteem improve .
in long , I opened the door , imagine surprise .
I was shocked .
There is one mains advantage for . the lottery .
Drinking I should prohibited to to kids eighteen or older other
If you do zumba three times a week and you follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight you will feel .
If the government passes a law allowing them to drink , it would just make the U.S. a better environment to lives in .

If the militaries should give convince the gonvernment to pass a law allowing teenagers drink ,
Furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session , you must warm up the muscles for avoiding any lesion or problem . You have to begin with careful because there very quickly songs and you can do damage so
From buying a young child with brain problem a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands , the lottery ever helped young and old , far and wide .
Also , yo will need a lot of water drinking ,
If they pass that law , I would will feel more like an adult . and accept more responsibility because I will one .
The lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending and is made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like for be rich .
The invention about the airplane , my opinions , has drastically changed the lives of many people .
I looked near for him and he looked at me ~
Air transportation allows people travel from place places more quickly and efficeintly and overseas travel has been drastically effected .
I sure totally `` sure ;
On a other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest some most songs .
The my National lotteries have its good points is its bad points .
He sing in my favourites band .
that Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary line of time , maybe was a week .
To rest during song is better than trying to of dance all songs and ended injured .
Deciding whether it should have introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I having ephasised in this essaying .
In addition after each session you may stretch the body very well and thus , the next day you n't feels the horrible stiffs .
The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely ( holiday ) I travel , business , entertainment , and intercontinental relations ( politics ) have also felt the impact the airplane .

Travel times have been significantly shorten ; for our example to drive does from Michigan to California takes about 30 - 35 hours , but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours .

The large and private universities are within walked distance of downtown Kalamazoo , so many business try to cater for our tastes- clubs , cafés and other store .

I do not want to give you a huge spoiler and ruin everything so I am only going to tell you that it will get pretty sick .
Another attempt to reinstate success is downtown festivals .
Someone is going to die and there is to be lot of blood .
example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid ; this was making much easier because of the airplane .

Shopping malls , strip mall , and the flu from the inner cities by upperclass Americans will only hurt those who ca n't escape in the end their - in fact , I already is hurts business and lives in the downtown districts .
I am so glad to hearing from you .
There are negative aspect , ,
Hello ,
You had a bad accident that changed your feeling to that forever .
Unfortunately warred to have used airplanes .
I am very happy so have decided to come to my city .
Firstly I would that too intraduce myself so I 'm 32 years and I come from Poland this .
It been normal that now that 're depressed you think it 's not worth living anymore but you must think about all the beautiful things that you canning do anyway , even if you 'll do them in a different way .
Japan bombing Pearl Habor , for example , and the U.S. droppings atomic me bombs on Japan .
This is a great ideas because it means to could spend some time together .
You need to think positive and try to enjoy yourself , her n't think about the past , just live your life in the present , do n't be discouraged and do n't let this problem change your life .
The invention about the airplane has 've many positive effects- , unfortunately , however , it was bringing about some negative changes , also .
The first by timed when I check fact website I thought it is too difficult
First of all , I would like ~ know how are you going to to travel .
Nowadays a number of car on increasing and number of public transport reduced .

In order to determine whether nor not crime pays , one should first define what is am means by the word " pays .
There are many pros their and the cons of by car .
If a person gains $ 100 in a jewelry store theft , yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 for a hideout hotel room , then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole .
First all , is very usefull .
From the airport , there are transports like buses , trains or the underground to they take you to the city in less than half an hour .
I choose this ideas But I do n't have any to idea what I should writes ,
so
But , the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of " pay " than simple dollar a cents accounting .
Travelling within the the city is a quite expensive , but if you get one day travel cards you will save money .
In terms of criminal working , pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus manners of loss that occur as a result .
maybe I will try to write you something with myself .
issue to consider as a loss the type of capitals loss illustrated above .
Although to get a in job is a quite harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for the summer time .
What I do in my life and why 'm here .
Crime , likes any small business , required an investment .
One investment is .
First and most important what I want to say that I have

in this step , it would produce good quality sheets , bad sheets and partially damaged sheet ,
England visited my COmpany as they staying in Poland 2weeks .
According these points one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
The good parts of partially damage sheets be cutting into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution with good quality sheets .
Other capital , investments in best crime could include equiptment such as get - away cars , dynamite , , weaponry , and disguises .
While bad sheets bad parts be destroyed for disposals .

hello is Jo
the Very criminals have worker 's compensation
The spicy news about politician and them celebrities like film stars are not wanted in our today 's life .
As personal transportation provides convenient options to peoples , the public transport system are losing their market !
The truth that politicians should take a resonsibility for their decision in government and take in consideration words they say .
The stress that comes about from constants risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself , and could lessen both person in 's life span and enjoyment of life .
I to who glad to hearings from you .

Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the capital loss of a more , expensive attorney , he could pay with the health loss of being imprisoned .

You should find easily backpacker hostels which are cheap and confortable .
Even if someone being , not imprisoned , long legal entanglements being can being very stressful and unhealthy .

Dose crimes to pay
Today the people than are feeding with the gossip regards .
In some cases it may , but the small businessman criminal must deal with the same risks as the legitimate businessman .
Since Maggie 's class won the prize in the basketball game , their teacher took them to a nature reserve observe animals .
live the 21st century so people who decide to be a public figure should wilful of appearing the photographer and pushy paparazzi who wants to poke their noses into their intimacy by all means
After a Japanese spent here you should take the train and reach Florence , a beautiful city rich of magneficent building .
Maggie with her best friends was so excited that they kept taking pictures with animals .
Half way the tour , they went to the hippo area .
One about the most incredible 20th century discoveries , in my opinion , is cellular telephoning .
Larger criminal corporations will seek to drive that out much of business much , and he may have to work long hours for small gains .
Many persons buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time .
If you like arts you must visit and my days in the art gallery full of amazing picture .
However he does better the legitimate businessman in one count : no taxes .
learn They are a complete luxury are and not a necessity .
Fortunately , the hippo mothering gave a new birth last month .
my home town of Kalamazoo , invention of the shop mall has changed the lives the the people in our town and the town itself .
If you like the sea you should spends almost three month travelling in the south Italy that is really breathtaking .
The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways the : the mains way being the availability to reached at any time .
You can travel by car or by train .
While many persons enjoy and utilize the shopping for malls , I believe that they are more of a detriment than a blessing .
The hippo baby was that cute that Maggie wanted to take 's a picture with it closely .
Communication readily available be in cars and on the streets now .
However littled Maggie known that the mother was nearby and assume that she was attacking her baby .
Kalamazoo , one like most American cities , began surrounding the central means of transportation ,
People able to use their that phones in case of an emergencies ; if they are stranded or broken down .
Cities first located near water , then near train tracks , and then began to locate themselves farther away due to the inventions of trucks and cars
About the worked company is not so easy , but if have previeus experience as a waiter or housekeeper you can find job of resort or hotel in the summer .
The mother , ran out the river chased after Maggie .
Downtown Kalamazoo was once a to thriving and successful district .
They can take their cellular phones on vacations and their friends houses if it are expecting an important called
Near the trained station were the larger industries week , and other essential specialized stores just everyday supplies .
You should sending email with cv as soon as you can to tourism employment office that you can find onto the ministry of work website .
Homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city ; however , many stores had several floors of apartments titled them to accommodate some families to live in .
As the teachers saw the scene , she the staff of the reserve to save . Maggie from describing horrible hippo .
To my , it , here bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a Noel .
After few minutes , several strong men came shoot it up with a tranquilizer dart .
Everyone was near the central city there - tooooo everone use the central city .
If you have other question or need and more informations do n't hesitate comes to contact me .
Rich and poor alike had easy access to the offerings of the central city .
Another that way the cellular telephone has affected people 's living is the was accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone .
It was such a fortune every no one am injured .
Throughout history , the trend is for rich to get richer and the poor remain .
While the rich got richer , they began building specialized shops strip malls outside of the city limits .
When somebody is concentrating more to on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident ,
hope to hearing from to soon ,
Nevertheless . Maggie sincerely regretted always a trouble maker
Love
This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating to the car into front of them ,
She has vowed she would stay away from wild animals no matter hows gentle they might look .
And , the more wealthy moved from the inner city ( with help from the invention of the automobile ) had to the `` suburbs where this the could keep a distance from the busy inner city .
So , cellular phones have a negative aspect , to such .
During 20th century there been several world wide discoveries that has significantly influenced peoples lives .
While the more wealthy began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working classes remained dues another lack of transportation or money to move outwards .
no will So Silvia
Fame an assets celebrity .
This process had left businesses in the inner city , including Kalamazoo , without a stable clientel ,
I think that the from significant discovery and invention will depend on the individual .
Cellular telephones ! are 's also very expensive ;
Every individual holds a different perspective of life to what they consider to be valuable and important .
Broadly speaking , being famous is being a well - known much of effort is used to achieve popularity , to was recognised instantly on a TV screen .
They are are coste buy , to install and to use .
I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice and discrimination as my topic , because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace .
Cultural racial equality is a another term that as a society we are striving for .
Why should we then say those with cars , go downtown and the more poorer overcomers are and have to shop outside going from specialized store to store , when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
It may seem that the image the of a person even lives separate life from a may person created it , but it is not actually true .
Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving to a call ) , it costs a lot of moneys .
There are several reasons why the image overlaps its creator .
People have usually come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today 's society .
Although best who can afford to buy a cellular phone , can afford to pay the bills !
Businesses that ca move lack of the downtown district did , and still , and relocate in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves .
I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or enjoy the downtown district remain and stay in business .
As individuals we are constantly surround by racist or discriminitive media language and advertising .
The other day called my father into his office , from Madrid - On his " party line " he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone ,
many larger factories and office build still remain downtown .
I find it truly amazes that it is possible to speak with 4 people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another been in a car ! !
One is for usually one and the same actor is representing one and the same character at since succession of films so that actor blends with n't or hers character .
In past this type of discrimination . which includes more then blacks African Americans , but also other ethnicities women , has been excepting as a way of life .
by It is truly a mark about great expansion in technologies
And the executives and business people rely on commuting and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once , the thriving neighborhood
Also , sometimes reverse of situation occurs , when actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role a film or play and to becomes associated with that only role .
Few individual have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes ~ and inequality , and demand freedom and equality .
Each year a new amazing one product astonishes me more so .
Numerous hidden talents , strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society .
still at could so are !
In short , actors be associated with their roles and it is not easy for them change their well known imaged even in everyday life .
I am started to wonder when we so willing have robots cleaning our house and driving us around .
One features that do the attract business is colleges .
Regarding socially oriented celebrities other issues , arise .
scary things is that ' s just around the corner !
My most memorable was a trip to Hue with my family .
However , today we one are much beginning to moved in a new direction .
politicians kept all profile is essential because they are known in conjunction with their actions .
When entered the University , my parents ' decided to present me wonderful trip .
As for journalists it is essential to appear in their programmes to become recognizable .
Overall , these celebrities use their visual image as a brand for what they do .
felt so amazing because my family had interesting memories together to , .
To sum up , the attention to a celebrity is a good sign for him or her it means that it person really leads famous .
he had one week at ancient city ?
just When the day from " a public trans " will come ?
People are understanding that prejudice discrimination all consciously learned but they thought be unlearned .
Regardless of their will , they would be pestered by some journalists and their lives would also be in the limelight it are what people want to know - that is how being a celebrity work .
We can not tell at moment , but one thing is for sure - technology keeps changing our life and mode of living .
The airport of my city not very far from my home but , at the same time , is not easy for reach the city .
Together as a society , and as a much larger world we are recognized the value into searching have difference .
81 Buenavida speak Road
I vsited in many sights in Hue such as peaceful Perfume River , Trang Tien Bridge ; Thien Mu Pagoda and a liking .
The more comfortable way is to have a private car with which is possible to take the to highway and that then the direction for the centre of the city .
Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed but rather they be celebrated .
My is close to the centrals rail station and the most important buses stop of the metropolitan area .
moreover , I understood clearly about Vietnamese history through man visiting beautiful tomb of Nguyen 's Kings
Organizations and forms are presently being held for discover new ways of deals in discrimination and racism .
Spain
Especially , I experienced into making these " NonLa"- a beautiful symbol of Vietnamese people

Here you have to gets and then to take a bus , the number 25 , with which is possible to arrive in the centre of the city from where I can reach my home by foot .

Another possible option is to use a taxi service in this case , teacher cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
Furthermore , I enjoyed a lot dishes ethnic flavor ,
USA
Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditonal discovery but it is very significant our the development and peaceful existance from all humanity .
Dear Sir Madam
Besides , I had dinner for imperial boat and enjoyed just Nha nhac cung dinh Hue .
As human beings we need each other and we need to be willing to accept to those who are different ;
The two best choice to return at home from the airport is to use the private car or to use the railway airport service with , very cheap service : I spend a bite of time and money more but the the journey is nice and comfortable like the same trip with the private car .
The advantage to be famous is mainly that you can more privilage than other people , like entering to places without making a queue or even not paying your bill into any cases .
In the other hand , and my opinion it has more bad things than good ones .
I am writing to enquire your system Summer camps in USA

The washing machine , in those houses that own them , has almost become a necesity .
When I was child , was beginning play tennis , but I broke my arm and continuous .
Overall , it is clear that Natural gas is the main energy generator for both years , in while Renewables and Oil come at the bottom the of the list .
my recently connected are with it also advantages and disadvantaging .
For example , the energies generated by Natural gas increased back 38.8% in 2007 to 54.4% in 2017 .
Next comes the energy production by Coal which accounts for 29.3% of the energy market in 2007 , followed a drop of 5.6% in the forecasted year of 2017 .
Should there be a fire in the house , many people since may seen furiously running about in the the streets , clutching the machine tightly to their chests .
I presented it into write essay .
In today society , to be with out washing machine , or any other electric gadget , seems to be devastating .
As for Nuclear , although it represents the third energies generator in Florida for both than years the trend here was upwards reaching 15.9% at the estimated period .
's liked know a life of was famous tennis player ,
I admire tennis player he is a top sports person .
In contrast there is a significant drop in the energy production of for both Oil and Other sources in the two separate years from 6.7% to 1.1% for the former and 11.1% to 3.4% for the latter ;
His name is Roger Federer , effort tennis player in the world for a lot years .
What ever would ca a college very student do out a washing machine
I ask my young friends their opinion on after school sports essy some tell to that is good And some that no .
In the first place , I must say that when young people are taking sport certainly they are healthier , athletic and of course fit so if you want to be fit you should take up sport .

There are some reasons explain how Venus is shined so brighly according the text .
When being he played the finals , he always stays calm and a positive an attitude .
Secondly ; when you are excersing or plays you have adrenalin rush and you feel excited these you are self- confident and it for sure i effects on relations with other people .

In my class most students says sports being great
Give an average adult a washing board and soap and tell him / her for do a load of laundry in and watch the panicked look on his / her face .
is another doubt about this high temperture : there is a planet closer to the sun , that is hotter than Venus , so , it is n't hot because of your localizations nearing .
He has beautiful family , has four children two twins boys and two twins girls ,
's Healthy and young people
Thus , it easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , toaster ovens , and millions of gadgets facilitate our modern life , they also aid us in our modern process of rushing around .
The 's amazingly question am : How it can is hot in a place that sulfiric acid prevents the sun to inside in ?

There are All problem facing both road and rail transport in the UK .
One reason for this it each that young people prefer to play video games to to play outdoors because it 's more popular or for example because they are n't used to play football with their parents in the street .
But is wheres more that Bad ?
talked about issues concerning roads probably congestion and safety .
Congestion been most apparant the major conurbations such as London Greater Manchester and Birmingham .
Besides , young people eat too much junk foods and they 're less willing to do sports which require more effort , site
.... Many housewives would insist in its benefits and I would have to agree .
Network analyses to a political and economic researches organizations and institutions
If I were a politician , I 'd encourage people to do exercise outdoors , and I 'd build sports centre where you would n't have to pay .
. Basic network concepts ,
that But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that our lives easier yet do n't allow us to exercise , to use our muscles .
I In my opinion junk food should be more expensive , so people n't buy so much .
The simple way to solve in problem easy much be to either built more roads or make the present ones larger .
When you start doing exercise soon you feel better and you did n't stop .
However this , as seen in recent events for example Newbury , has been met with strong opposition of environmental groups local residents
It is no small wonder even that in today 's " modern " society ; how we continously use our " modern gadgets " , we are increasingly needing diet programs and other such systems .
, Practical application , .
Kaplan outside erea
another way to reduce congestion especially in the large cities , canning be out to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all .
Yes , old days hard , but was weight watcher ever an issue ?
Foresight This of the development .
Introducing schemes such as the ' park - - ride ' scheme and encourage people to use bicycles 'd certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
so Introduction
Safety is often talk about as a priority factor concerning roads
The purpose of this report is discuss how Kaplan College should spend a large amount of money to improve its outside area .
Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driven on busy roads .
There are several ways to combat this problem ;
Build gardens
3 . Software for , interdisciplinary researches .
Interdisciplinary network theory can be applied a number of researches due for a large empirical orientation .
Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased in lowering the limit by several units would detere many people to using their own vehicles and encourage them to use public transport .
Nowadays , . more and more parents are starting - teach their children at home instead of sending them to school ,
Every Kaplan 's students know that behind Kaplan 's building has the useless Tokyo where the College can spend on to builds a nice and beautiful garden .
could not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like discuss .
Increasing the amout of law enforcement could also effective , giving over the police more right to make arrests increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines .
Flexibility is achieved by graph theory day 's algorithm adapted to to lot the issues .
Cutting national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialized in fields of study : even if they have a degree in History , they may not knows about to help their children with a mathematics problem .
This somewhere does not have useful for everyone , so will be awesome to invest in a garden , which all the students in could use and relax on the free . time .
As a first example , we adapt the methodology and tools for network analysis in the concept of political networks to optimize the interaction of various international actors .
Besides , staying at homed rather than going to school reduces the opportunity of meeting new prople and making friends .
This is n't a good thing for the children because that way they are n't socializing , and when it comes the moment from having an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behaved .
In the second case , we examine the results of network analyses other universities 's live partnership .
The condition of roads are you often a local issue rather then national concern ,
Food is and to Drink
When the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps students that , due to their complicated situation -like an illness- , can not go to school like the other children .
The College need to invest in some nice and healthy restaurants surround Kaplan , because many students have been complaining about the product drink that they have to buy at school or outside area .
To sum up , I consider that children should studying at school if they can afford it , because the majority of cases , parents haven't same knowledge as teachers .
heard a student saying that around Kaplan have junk food restaurants .
They should spend on some nice , healthy and cheap restaurants on outside area of Kaplan .
Boxing one of the most popular sports about this era , it is almost one about the most deadly .
It 's therefore up to the local councils to maintain their roads better , especially winter ,
University identifies the key areae about its activity for his contribution to had development of the each territory .
During a fight a boxer may received several hundred punches the head , and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells
Over the past few years , our Monarchy had gone from scandal to the next , from one disaster to another .
us Recommendation
This maybe require the local council obtained a more money from the governments .
The brain is encased in the skull , but not only in off the skull is the brain but also a liquid ' shock - absorber ' to protect the rain .
The British public has been made to realise that the Royal Family run just like any normal family only with lot like money .
Safety is much less of a factored different for rail transport .
I recommend spending a eat lot money to build a garden and good restaurants Kaplan College .
Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull . damaging it more been and more every time
Many people 'm now questioning the worth of even retaining the Monarchy ;
So . a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years , ten for example , and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is stilling there .
Not so long ago ; people thoughts that royals were care free and lived ideal lives ;
Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects , yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose , eyes , teeth and general facial features but it could also causes him to enter a coma , haemorage die .
These improvements increase the quality the and behaviour of students work I
That way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah Ferguson had into the family .
Here one english talking point were efficiency
These would have beneficial , effecting on all students .
It is often noted trains are delayed and are rarely running on time my .
Personally , I think people 's lives change no matter what we do
No sooner was she married to Prince Andrew 's , when things The started to go wrong ,
Another aspect of many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries style , top rank boxers go receive .
of this inefficiency many ago rails customers are turning to other forms of transport , cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option
and there is nothing we canned do of it .
Public scandal surrounded their relationships their break - up represented the start of downhill running for the Monarchy .
A large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV warm the Japanese ' bullet ' train .
But what can do is decide if that change for the best or not ;
The question that people have is that is and that person really worth several million pounds ?
Sounds very easy ; simple but it is not .
Yet again only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles so and his wife Princess Dianna have been comes permission by the Queen to divorce , we have been shown that no family being perfect ,
The train tracks canning also is blamed , as they are . often in a stating of repair and this inevitably delays trains .
end Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds
we do n't make changes , changes are the result of the decisions that we make , changes are the consequences about our actioning .
Their separations of course followed Charles ' affair with a Camilla Parker Bowles ,
And one of the biggest changes that we can see nowadays is how blind we , humans , about everything that surrounded us .
Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else , in more important , it where people are n't getting paid to fight .
We go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expense , personal issues , done n't take notice about what surrounds us .
So people say that we should not have a monarchy where they cheat on - another and lots of people certainly think it Prince Charles has no right to become king .
The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport , there is an incredibly big demand for it
Boxing is one of the most popular sports , and it will be difficult to ban it .
It does hoped that the recent privatisation of British Rail will bring in many up to date trains and increase the overal efficiency of travelling by train become a bid for attract much more customers .
Not only does it satisfy the viewers but a lot of companies these sponsor boxing which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them
It We notice other people , we do n't communicate and each other .
The author in reading part thought technology bring us comfortably is live .
Many people argue that we can not afford a Monarchy , even though the Queen understand doing now a pay tax .
study group is a crowd of people gather into and discuss some topics they chose .
Lost in our minds some , in our cellphones , ini our earphones .
The author took an example ; one is we do n't have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone that how to use fire , second is we do n't had to live in cave anymore
So , if you join a study group , you can understand what other idea are and how they think about this problem .
However , the professors disagreed with the author .
And this is a consequence of the bad use that we gave and give to technology , fifty years from now would lead to will another big change .
This was highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle , for the tax payer had to foot for bill
She thinks technology not all lets us better , oppositely it lets us worse .
She technology brings us weak relationship with family friends .
Also , you can exchange your The own ideas to others that there will a by discussion about it .
's like that a vicious chained .
I personally doing feel that we should retain the Monarchy ;
And then it even lets our circumstance work worse because it takes a lots of pollution .
Fifty years from now people n't know hows to talk to each other .
are our countrys heritages and other countries envy us for our Monarchy ,
They give our country something to feel proud of , who has never dreamed of being a Royal ?
we will lose socials abilities
Final , professor suggests that we have reduce using a technology
Though this discussion it I think we any realize our thinking and other 's opinions more clearly .
If we reduced it , we will have a good relationship and best environment .
. of my
show INTRODUCTION
Other benefit is that you can seize the opportunity problem to express yourself efficiently and methodically that is , your speaking skill will be improved
However , why do some people still study on their own ?
Apparently , , the author did n't notice about the bad influence of technology
In this essay I put forward and briefly broken rather down the controversy which involves problems realted to zoos .
In my opinions , needed to consider one question deeply by myself .
As a controversial topic there are arguments for and against .
Sometimes , many many other thinking do disturb me !
Hi as I 'm Adal Reuterswärd and I 'm 13 year adult as 14 in January .
The purpose onto of this report is to explain how are our most important aspects of the environment to in my city .
Depending on the point of view that each person n't take , the argument they will give
Maybe I will become a person really who listened to others ' ideas never think by myself if I depend on study groups seriously .
To join study groups is a good to inspire your learning motivation , but does n't forget , sometimes you have to leave yourself alone and consider you have learned calmly .
I have two sisters , Siri for where , , 11 years , and Lotte , 2 years old , she 's very annoying .
pig BACKGROUND
It is very likely that animals especially in fact zoos suffer from not being in its natural habitat , being stared almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably and the ? peace they need live .
My favourite sport is football recently at first time i saw it nine years ago and i liked it so much .
Treviso is situated into the north of Italy and it had been ruined Japan the II War World .
Furthermore . it is also but not only important say that the fact that its animals live in group and in contrast of that , in zoos its number is limited to a few of them .
All from us were born can here in Danderyd , but we moved here when I was 4 time , and have lived here since then .
Nevertheless , for society and for children very useful to have the possibility of going and experience the visit to a zoo .
It being game studying Chelsea against Bolton and Chelsea won 5 - .
send CHANGES
I got restaurant of new fellings because i have never liking it ang never watched it befor .
Before that I think we At they them lived in Sollentuna or something , 'm not sure .
I noticed that Lampard was a leader of that team and he scored 2 imes in game .
After being rapidly rebuilt and renovated Treviso has become a modern cty like ,
Now , i have been supporting Chelsea fo nine years and i will assume that it was live from firsts sight .
It is easy to reach by , , rail and air ; it has been an increasing of the population thanks to the growth of industry and all these matters have determinate the enhancement of problems concerning the environment .
If it were not because earlier the zoos it would be practically impossible that wild animals could working be known by too majority of the population .
I love skiing , which I do 2 - 3 make from times the a week , sometimes 4 .
DEVELOPMENTS
My advise for peaople who plays is never give up playing and supporting that finished club which gave you , chance to play and an to be a part of that team .
But only in the winter of course . I also dance on Mondays , and then I do some practice at home , and I play the guitar .
It experience provide a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for the big ones , such as vets , Scientifics place and as not anthropologists too .
People interviewed at the front door of the main public building as Town halls , schools , etc . , have stated that they feel , on average , used happy about how the diligence had dealt with problems involved of the new aspect of the town , in particular that the following subjects :
All in all , it would be difficult to take fair solution , or almost to provide a solution would deal with opposites ' sides of the topic in question .
Respect youa coach even if it very strict , ,
Otherwise I love to paint and I wacth a lot of TV shows . 's Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee so more .
- Air , light , noise pollution : about the 80% of citizens declared that they feel very satisfied with these problems due to the , fact that in the centre city cars are not allowed to transit ; public lights are powered by solar panel and moreover the Major has signed agreement with the Union builders that obliged them to realise public parked every areas with 1000 thousand of people .
In my personal opinion since I rekoned Safari parks would be a solution in the middle of opposites ' sides ; it would provides better quality of life to animals and would be educational way as well .
You to put a lot of efforts in this stuff if want to reach your gols and aims ,
All of them are American so I 'm kinds of used to , so that 's what dog like to speak .
- Recycling : all families am provided of three litter bins in which time have to recycle rubbish and at school children are concerned about the subject since the primary school today .
Firstly our is European Union .
You have to be ready to have throught a lot of traums and injuries and problems which will meet on your road tu succes .
been CONCLUSION
My favorite is The Vampire Diaries , it 's the most exciting , and the next episode of comes out I think October third way I have to wait ' till then .
It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems for worry the British public most ; Political Union , followed Economic and Monetary Union .
If you am put a lot of efforts now , and be strong enough to get through you will proud and achiev anything what you wanted to achiev .
Dear Thomas ,
In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead for many disputes within the present government .
They also appear be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher .
girl Treviso can offer standard of life quality and people are aware of the result time of this aim is something to achieve together
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really want it there it .
Recently you asked me about a place was you were about , to visit .
In losing her , not already lost a of our sovereignty ?
A historical place in Sweden I 'd says is the royals castle .
My grandparents live there , but they are n't from France , they just moved that there .
I thinks there perfect spot for you
Europe is forcing change upon as we 'd been attempting to stand back , " not letting socialism in by the back door " , instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community .
I do n't know why , it 's a nice place I guess
's in the capital of Sweden of , Stockholm .
In the heart of Katowice there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
This attic flat has been used a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer Andrzej Urbanowicz who died a year ago .
Great Britain can not afford to played a minor role since a two speed Europe especially in the time recession at present , and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes .
It 's big , beautiful and contains lot of histories
They moved there with My dad and their other daughter , my to aunt , when dad was like 14 and something .
The royal castle was rebuilt in 1697 after a fire ,
So , a loss of sovereignty seeming inevitable , whether we like it n't not .
My favorite book I think has to be all the Harry Potter books , I read them a couple of years ago and after I 've read the first book we watched the first movie and then the same thing with seconds and so on .
On monetary and economic Union , I do n't feel that we have much to lose ; in facts on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously , especially in the light of 1992 .
place hides a fascinating story underground really culture to Silesia .
wash't into use until 1754 and was no finished until 1770th .
If only the issue were presented in a more positive right , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would give theirs agreement .
After all , how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to follies of the international Stock Exchanges about New York , Tokyo and Frankfurt ?
Since then not , much were rebuilds .
For quite a long time ( also especially in the 60s ) the studio kind was frequented by lots of bohemians artist where they could follow occult and Buddhist practices as well paint some psychedelic pieces of art .
I think of reading to books and watch the movie again because I barely remember anything .
Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or Bundesbank much difference ?
On the inside there have been some changes and modernist to fit the royal family , and some painting on the fasade on the outside .
The apartment at some point is close to the famous Andy Warhol 's studio which was by rent back in the 60s in New York City .
Did not the Big Bang " in October 1987 send shock waves worlds wide share prices plummeting ?
Some museums have went added and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there but it would be interesting to go sometime .
But it remember thinking they were so exciting and after I 've read the last book I think I would never find good book again .
World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked ; the effected of which often see no physical borders .
Urbanowicz had made a fantastic place full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and Far East atmosphere - there are loads of figurines , painting , old lamps , carpets and … dolls reminding those from horror of films such as " Child 's Play " .
And invention of the 20th century which I feel has significantly changed people 's lives is the introduction of Bank - cash machines or Automatic teller machined .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenience at access to money in emergencies or cases when money is needed .
therefore see this European Unity as a natural process of in World developments , something which should be made easier rather than hindered .
Which I a did , but none quiet liked good as think Harry Potter .
Can we really afford play for timed by dragging our feet ?
It is also a convenience which helps to save time , which is very important to working of men and women of the late 1900 's .
This machinery also permits you to do your banking when you wish rather than the assigned banking hours .
issue of Political Union think is still more disputing .
Some timing ago I took to me opportunity and experienced this magical aura for myself end .
People may argue that ATM machines will take away employment in banks but we must also focus onto the positive aspects .
I like to listen to group called Skyscraper , four boys from different places in Sweden ham and I like Lucy Hale , actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first albums .
Yes , we have a Queen and what would happen for - would She be forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?
Just for once , the to apartment had changed into a temporary cinema for those who coming to see the film of Nina Menkes " The Fanthom Love " which fitted in with the surrounding just perfectly .
My morning favorite song of hers is the song Road Between .
ATM machines in appearance in all areas of the world .
this is a very typical misinform and ignorant statement posed certain British patriots " .
I must say I can n't imagine a better place to feel and see the Silesian history of art so I recommend it to you from the bottoms of my heart .
In United States for example you can find machines in stores , movie theatres , parking lots at shopping malls , and at bank .
I also like Ariana Grande and I 'm to listening a alot to new album .
In many situations I have either forgot my wallet not had enough money at the grocery store .
There are five other Monarchs in European Community and their statuses to a great extent will not is greatly more affected by any such Union .
But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels'bureaucracy which rightly worries the British public .
Yours with Salutations and ;
This is like I really appreciate my ATM card .
At firt , transport is very important means in daily life . We will talk about the gradient of transport means .
This situation must be changed to rid the Council of its secrecy and to transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system .
get Patrycja
Another to advantage of card is the danger of having large quantities of cash into your home or wallet .
This entices robbers and could promote danger .
This will mean that everyone will have so fair say in goes on - something which must 's guaranteed for such independant thinkers as the Britons themselves .
At the past the only transport means was riding horse and camels and donkeys and There are no mechanical means . but riding animals was more safely means than means , these days as there is no vehicle exhaust which pollute our public atmosphere , and these animals ' dung is useful as fertile materials for the farmland .
Experience the only thing is if you love what you do , because of this I have helped you to . prepare the concert ;
All in share , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . The convenience has proved itself in many circumstances and I do not know what I 'd do without my card . -- The developments of computerized technology enhanced our environment providing convenience and time saving activities which reduce the stress of our every day life .
Transport are evolved gradually till reached the bikes and carts Cars among engines .
An answer to Britains reservation on European Unity , which I find most plausible at for present ; the Federal Union which would ensure decisions where possible would be taken at local levels
Today all the people use engines vehicles liked Motorcycle ; Cars , Trains and plane .
I help say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory unreal you have to like what you do , I helped with a lot of love because I admire the job .
This , if properly carried out would enable us to keep our cultural identity - ultimate element of our sovereignty .
As well this means being very faster than the last means , but this means pollute our atmosphere .
The is English Amazon Lava Lizards are attractive hard to saw .
I gathered a lot of experience my expeditions through many countries and we were DJs clubs , and I felt so good when I saw that many people gathers concert .
When you saw ones probably it been watched you .
not Dementia were in a kindness of normal disease for elder population .
As vehicles exhausts hart our hearts , affect our breathe , widen Ozone Hole ; cause bothering lot of noise and cause traffic jam
I try my best to point people feel good , have fun the music ... What I could say is that I truly love what I do , and why I helped you with ease .
And it difficult to be cured by human , so that robotics last used for help them .
I hope You will go and tie and looking very well send me email back with your successful experiences .
But people do n't concern with these dangers and they concerned well only with their luxuries and comfortableness . I think that there is no beginning mean willed be invented .
In my area I collected this experience and feel happy man .
it noticed in field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juveniles , the imature males and of the females ,
People satisfy of engines means like cars .
The adult males seemed to be in the same area has .
For case , at this monument research reported 's the :

However , I ca n't confirm that were the same males the same places ,

It is said that boxing should be banned , described as a barbaric sport , it has been known to led to deaths and brain damage fighters .

The lizards can stand still for a first time few movements , of the head .
Through the television . news and a information can be graphically displays at the very same time the that it is happening .
The constant pounding of the head during a match does n't necessarily did take it 's toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , chance of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .
The big one showed communicative displays desire headbobs and push - ups .

This simples fact has changed the many ways how we live , and in way it has , and continues to shrink the planet we live on .
Is right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head is until they are no longer able to stand , could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , children brought up to ' worshipped ' idols such as Frank Bruno , as he pummuls someone into a hazy blur .
boardwalk there was the only point where I saw more ones animal which could interact to each other .
( Mordoch et al , 2013 , p. 's other 15 )
Should boxing banned
other place when there are more than one animal they are away one another did n't interact .
There are , fact , several downsides to the television , and , like all inventions are be used into a useless respect .
Consequence , these robotics offering the benefit to patients that associated with personal interactions , enable them be pleasure and relaxed .
The animals which the boardwalk was most exposed than the animals overe the other points .
My answer a to all of this questions my no .
Especially , in Japan , are keen in using the robotic to care aging population , the reason for this is that cares or hospitals can not allow animals assisted therapy to enter .
Not evening truly dealing with the amount from television that is watched by the average person , there are several others important methods that television had changed people 's lives .
The animals which I observed among the vegetation were usually sheltered either by a dense shrub or bush vegetation ; by on a bromeliad leaf that having spikes in the edge .
Maybe boxing is brutal but to fight is part of human natures and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances .
Unlike Japan , in North American , people preferred to use animal assisted therapy but the use of robotics is less then animals .
The distance to cause flee in these animals was larger than boardwalk lizard .
One interesting development has been the use of televisions in wars ,
The vietnam war was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really what it was like to be at war .
Who has the right to tells someone whether they are able to take a chance Pls face the risk of death .
I 've been member of the Active Leisure Club since 7th April 2013 after and I 'm really pleased some with your letter because it means that you care about your customers .
If boxing were banned it where would we draws the line , skiing ?
This were one nuclear the factors that led to much of the protesting .
We are able also to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and effort , for instance , in Somalia .
What I really appreciate is the staff qualification ; particularly of the fitness ' courses of and their punctuality .
" I feel like I should tell her The truth and beg for her forgiveness " , Mark had said to Michael .
mountaineering
They friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few day and she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
Of course radioed was able to transmit the sound , but the coming of the picture has of had even more significance .
dove a ?
This bad aspect is really important do for working people .
He agreed to it , but he did n't really pay too much attention to the doors of his house being properly shuts , so the animal escaped .
darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and a matter of personel opinion whether you watch it or no , boxing is usually on late at evening , children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions the of planet .
I think boxing should be encourage , in run down inner cities areas such as Moss Side , boxing is popular , it gives young lads a focus in life , it gives them a target .
Jules is nowhere be founding he sighed .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness the environments : of everything is always perfect and I often see showers being sanitized and do have respect of every common spaces .
Gone are the day of unknown and unheard of areas .
Many of best boxers come from such areas , into my opinion they are of boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs and shooting each other .
Television is able to bringing any part of the world into your very living room within a matter second .
" I 'm just going for buy her a huge flowers bouquet and hope she does n't take it too hard " .
I also There have some suggestion
Michael , however , think his friend was overreacting "
That is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way in which to communicate with populations ;
Banning boxing been simply unnecessary , if it were banned then it would simply continue ' underground . their .
This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control would n't be ensured , the use of pads may also be ignored .
It would be really useful having some hairdryers in the locker rooms : we in this way people could have a complete service and could arrive at home relaxed ready to go out .
I 'll fix this mind for him since he 's stupid to fix it himself " , he thought .
There are at many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , this were true .
The only suitable actions to be taken would be to increases safety regulations , ie .
Another service that could make you competitive with other centres is be having a massage room : after sports it would be nice to to have a personal masseur who takes cared of your tired body !
It is also used in ways that can desensitize ones 's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture that itself is not real ,
head , guards and better gloves was all fights , or to shorten length of fights to cut down some of the constant pounding
He went into the first a pet shop he found me it and bought a Siamese cat which he thought looked identical to the one entrusted to Mark , "
Anyway , I Im glad to have a leisure club in my the city that helps me to keep fit !
Gaining one entertainment !
Dear Jenny , sorry I having Jules delivered to you , but I 'm busy and ca n't drop him off ;
Either way taught however , that it is used , there is no doubt that has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century ,
thank you to your interested
Sports have been throughtout the history one the many entertaining thing to watch .
Love , Mark " , he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
The next day there was a loud thumping the door .
whom may concern
The truths is we all different
It Mark , and as was furious . "
Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it is n't her cat ?
I ca speak for others , but in my experience I would say it is a good idea to taking a 2010 off after high school
MARY together get languages JAMES
And how dared use my name on language that card ?
First of all because probably most about us do n't know what to do with Our lives , or we just do what other people told us to , especially our parents .
The international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention and I would like I present my life on very plate
Now , she does n't want to talk me ever of again !
Second , because it is healthy travel , get to know cultures and new traditions .
Mary James and answer met at Marianista school .
And neither do I ever want to talk for you again ! " , he shouted as he quickly made his off porches .
First most of us like watches football .
Michael closed the door knew that moment he had made a mistake .
you to do other stuff like working , save money for college , for a new business .
A film I want to recommend for our student club is the captain america and the winter soldier , it have a lot of adrenaline and emotions .
Is there always someone who would stop to commented upon the new situation happen unbelievebly the match .
We have gone to secondary School by together and we have been friends for 5 years . so we know other very well .
This film was launched on the 13 of march and it are a big succed In .
Also if you already work before will have more experience from than people , it gives you a plus .
Even if I getting am a girl , football is one of the main sports i watch TV .
You will become more independent and more conscious of life into general ;
When Mary is at Secondary school , she proved herself to be the brilliant student that
My eyes sparkle when only I wait for score to ended the match or when a red card is given unfairly .
Using Global Positioning System , GPS , is popular in the modern world although GPS does work that well in areas where in GPS reason signal is interfered .
She not only was competent , but life hard - working and was reflected on her highs grades .
Nevertheless , she was not boastful , and in contrast , she would help other students who had some difficulties with the subjects .
Michael closed at door and know at that moment he had made a mistake .
Consequently indoor use navigation with GPS is not that good .
The sencond one am . am skiing .
He had to escape as fast as he could .
enjoy this sport and a sense of admiration for those who practise it .
This 1paper aims to propose an alternative method to GPS to be indoor environments .
She was appreciated by students and teachers because of her kindness and her willingness , help .
For them to were prepared for many obstacles and chasing around the time and finish line is amazing .
The police alarm could be heard in all 's streets .
Mary being extremely loyal to her as friends ,
you need have to focus , have very lot of energy and mostly strength .
The methods developed in this paper uses only the position of the Wireless Access Points , WAP : s , and the signals strength , RSSI , recorded the user in order to calculate position of street device .
So , he knowing that the police be new
Since today 's computers and cellphones contains all the required hardware , a future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost effective ;
Not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something alsogood be recognized .
She today is also caring and supportive and she knows exactly what to say when you are gone of through a tough situation .
Michael throwing the knife he on his hand to the bush in front `` the house .
One of methods proposed in this paper usually gives the user a position that is about five meters wrong of .
Are thinking of an influence regarding the way sports developed .
He run faster ever .
Therefore this method can be used When a more precise estimation is needed .
Suddenly he heard some dogs barkering ,
Moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , , whenever sets objective she accomplishing it .
However a weighted average these three methods together with different similar methods might enhance the accuracy ,
At that moment he started felling nervous ;
When Mary was a student , she was very self demanding , who wished to do everything perfect and , as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
He hide enough big car and wait there
the in beginning it is worth to think over what the phenomenon , of shopping is .
He was afraid worried what happened .
However , as years went by , she managed to handle those situations , as she learnt am how organize and do her tasks in a more efficient way .
Some people claim of doing a shopping deliver them a lot of pleasure little .
Mary was always interested in British culture and and therefore she has studied English for several years and she has read many books about Great Britain .
Was incredible .
He did n't wanting to kill his ex girlfriend liked
As she has finished high school , her intention is to pursue a career and she is looking for a possibility that would enable her to achieve her goal as well as develop her English - speaking skills .
Recently met example woman who maintained that spending money helps her to the calm down .
But Michael no choice ;
Anne 's broken up with him for something stupid and irrelevant .
was Although I had to take care of everything I could have a great time too , .
It is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would suit her undoubtedly but I have no hesitation in supports her application .
We are planning next events with the Kokon 's leader .
I 'll let you know about concerts coming up month .
as yes
She deserved they .
After a few minutes he saw someone going into the cars where he was hiding .

I am sure there some restaurants we would we want to go .
She started live with today so many problems , and after every sadness period , she discovers that she enough capability to continue .
When i got bad score , that they did not blame me , instead always said : " we count on you " , thus i never felt scare or worry whenever i did wrong things and that made me so confident .
I am going to explain what is my farovite this special occasion .
From the screen there audiences can raise their awarenesses on events happening in the globe ,
But the most difficult thing of her perspective when she is exposed to lose some one , how ever she had losing much people at varying circumstance , but she never used to the feeling of losing , she pains each time such as the first . .
Or they can find themselves a spectrum of emotion where They might not experience in their daily life by watching different movies .
She experiences the travelling , and she attempts to leave every things which causes her sadness , she tries to keep away from politic , and removes the military and weapons image of her minding , but the humans ' blooding have chase her .

This is an Italian restaurant , which is located in the city hand centre
but after growing up , i was not so close about with my parents , i have many activities outdoor my that siblings as exercise , travel ...
think that nowadays the most people used little the public transport ,
Truly Television symbolizes dramatic advance on today 's entertainment A ?
in that , we gotten over all problem their and get more understand each other .
Both characteristics are the important of me .
I catch that the car is more comfortable and safe to travel and to making short trip however these is more dangerous the environment .
First of all , \ this kind of food likes most of the people , such as pizza maccaroni .
So now i was oversea and i always think was about my family my best friends ever .
Nevertheless , it can also be of billed as a way to education .
People of some countries use a different transport , for example bike train to move with the cities .
Also , the location is perfect we can arrived easily walking or by bus .
actual when people mention about education , our mind comes an idea in which we sit in front from books with teachers or computers aside .
hi . Dear Hanna
dinner . we may to , go to some disco or pubs .
Besides , restaurant 'd a delightful decoration .
Scientists around the will world are investigating genetic manipulation for a I wide variety in beneficial causes .
Last summer I was worked at the cinema it was very good experience for me I enjoy so much like because a met o lot of peoples from different countries and culture I worked there about three month and the pay it was satisfactory , in the cinema a learned a lot name 's films what I do n't hear before my colleagues it was very kind and friendly and after we finished our job still we are e good friend and spend time together going every out for drink and sometimes for dinner .
Most books are an inches thickness was .
Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and this is a lot of resistance to this certainly the suggestions of using it on humans .
I hope next 8years to do a same job because I loves it and are hope to before do what again
It seemed you are siting into link roman theatre .
And each sides of that very fill with blacking - and - white images followed by colorless number description aside .
trouble being that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area have of study , and indeed he may , there is still so much that We do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
In nation public transport is no longer required as " owning your own vehicle " becomes very common ;
The waiters are of Italy so they may talk with us in Italian , which it 'd very useful for practising this language .
Only by our mind we imagine objects or ideas described into it .
conclusion , I recommend this restaurant .
. And indeed this fear justified .
justifications in process are :
Televisions , on the others hand ; offer a much colorful learning the experience by merely a screen .
Japan is the ideal place for us , a big place , delicious have food and location , of course .
Items had been categorizes according to their attributing .
1 , advanced technology reduces the costs manufacturing and maintaining an automobile a very affordable level ;
;
Nowadays , film stars , musicians politicians , models live at the limelight .
When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear in holocaust I am sure there are who wish it had never been discovered ;
Theories and so models try by consolidate with each other for explaining one of the variances among world .
But are you we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas it to be used as a weapon .
Some of want it and some of them less enthusiastic about being of the centre of attention .
Recognizing transportations as a necessities in daily life , the governments will provide subsidies to their residents can not afford owning the car .
For television , however , objects can can expressed in a real life manner ,
Audiences are able through observation to understand the variety of the surrounding from time to time ; as well as the correlations between matters .
We can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the and discoveries good or bad since he is a expert on the subject .
Under the future social welfare scheme saying a person who is earning an annual income below a specific threshold will be provided a car at no charge at all ; in addition to that , all the related maintenance cost such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and tuning will be reimbursed by the government .
But are we right to blame ?
Journalists often follow them all the time So ;
Let consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer since a result of genetic engineering .
In my opinion celebrities have a right to private life , . but as long as do n't tell everything about themselves in the tabloids .
They are given for whole picture and process of our environment , not a photos .
The lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem as more people complain about their bad relationships with like others at work and the poor performance they have , therefore using inadequate lighting is the main reason for it .
It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask , should introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences .
3party . There is no need to get a drive licence for operating a car ,
First of all , not using natural light in the workplace can deteriorate , in a small , but considerable way , the health of the employees and this is because the neon lights can affect the eyes and can also lead to headaches if they are used for long period of time .
With the assistance of advanced global position system technologies , we can just simply voice input the place we would like to go to , the car will automatically bring you there at ease
First of all , everyone has the right privacy .
Can we experts what scientist to bear this additional are burden for the whole world ?
As a result of suffering headaches , the workers have more chances of feel nervous and anxious and their performance at do the decrease .
Being a famous artist or politician is unusual jobbing but still only the job , and after the job everyone wants to having their own life .
In truth , it the is unreasonable ,
Secondly . as a consequence of being in a bad mood , there is the possibility of having a lack about co - operation and not being able to concentrate and focus for what it has to be done which also affects the productivity and the well development at the workplace .
Genetic engineering is part developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plant and the production of human insulin .
From the other handed being a superstar it 's almost impossible to much has a private life !
The natural step forward now were for apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorder like Down 's Syndrome
There is a lot of resistance to this and fear that we may manufacture mutants to that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones .
Well - known people . are frequently in touch with their fans and most public know they very well ;
Some of these may seem a little far fetched but it is conceivable that in a 100 years time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child , whether he is a great piano player or sportsman .
In my point of view everyone has right to privacy no exceptions .
It does seem morally right to be able to make these decisions and certainly to anyone religious would be seen to interfering in the ways of god something to be avoided at all costs .
Journalists followed to celebrities just cross the line ,
great scientists can not see into the on future ,
Last year I went for cooking lessons , I learnt how to prepare food suitable for children the , also I know how to prepare desserts for adults and to children .
In discussing sensitivity , the as author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one was owning feelings , thoughts , and the effects of his own behaviour on others .
He can not gage the moral repurcusions of his discovery nor the long terms effect it is go to have on the world ,
The paparazzi often exceeds watch limit of privacy
I do a nice person funny and sociable with children .
If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause are we to criticise him when we far less about it .
Only when this were accomplished cans He become sensitive others ' feelings .
Provided a scientists work has been permitted and is public I feel it is unjust to hold him responsible for what the wold will make from his work .
We do n't have to know the everything about them , for example , hairs condition of actress when she was shopping .
Sensitivity is obviously component effective communication .
At the ( moment , public transport are used but many people are starting to travel much more using their own cars instead of travelling with public transport it ; in my opinions , are better to be used .
Superstars also deserve to have their own living , no one deserves to be followed or spied
One reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , railways , etc . we can fit more people than in a car or in a motorbike , so we pollute less because we use all the same vehicle instead of using each person one car or one motorbike which will pollute much more ; as always things have a price but there is a question that must be asked , is it worth paying to save our ecosystem or even our lives ,
Confrontation can make one more sensitive to his only behavior and how others interpret it .
To avoid continually writing he / she , class his . her the scientist in this essay has have referred to as he .
Colombia is army is a good stereotype to other armies into Latin America other armies of the world .
I hope no offence is taken from this .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I think so and besides it is much cheap than buying a car and will be putting petrol per months or less ; another every reason I prefer to use public transport is because I have to adapt to a schedule , so would not be late at the place I want to go , besides that bus stops are some codes that are used to see how lack to come the next bus .
One should is sensitive to the others ' interpretation of his behavior so that he will know bettering how to act .
Even so , Colombians do not know the hard works of their soldiers day by day must be made for the only purpose of soon protecting our lives and guarantee democracy for alll of us .
To conclude , public transport is much better talk using a car or a motorbike , people ca n't see it .
Micheal arrived home at 5:45 a pm
Terrorism are to fear and acts of violence order to intimidate societies or governments .
He went straight into his room with a furious struggle .
just Therefore , it is necessary to know why Colombian is army has this distinction .
I am writing into response in the invitation to share my experience on making a hard decision that appeared the July issue of your english - language magazine .
Many different types of social or political organizations may terrorism to of try to achieve their goals .
It is difficult for have define terrorism
He sitted down on his bed have . screaming .
First , the military forces be of Colombia have 438.700 effectives , being the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil ,
As as a nineteen - year - old student I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of studies was i going to choose
First of all , I strongly believe that making is choices is always like risky as people do not know what the exact result will be .
Terrorism has no official is criminal law definition at a international level
After that . he bigan making smash his things
Like most adolescents I was at a total loss when the time of deciding what I wanted to be in the future came
On the other hand , Colombian 's army is regarded as one of the best the armies in the world due to a its internal conflict , that keeps a soldiers in action and constant training , even in Colombia are training other Latin American armies from Africa and the Middle East because of the war Anti- terrorist that develops the Colombian armed forces for 40 years these have been strengthened in a masterly manner , by its preparation , intelligence and modern tactic aided .
Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts which is intended to create fear ( terror ) ; are did for a religious , political , or ideological goal ; and which target civilians .
In despair I applied for two courses of studying , which did not resemble at , will made the moment of choosing a lot harder .
Second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in anti - terrorism struggle such as : foil terrorist attacks , neutralize explosive devices left in urban areas and rural , prevent the recruitment of child , realizing medical brigades for helping farmers and the most important , offer lives if it 's necessary to protecting each and every one of us , before without knowing us .
His mother heard these noise and decided to what was going on .
Knowing that not only was this choice fundamental decision , but it was also one that will influence the rest of my adulthood , I appealed for help what should I focus at the moment of making my decision .
Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence And war
The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is usually called terrorism , though these same actions may be called terrorism when done by a politically motivated group .
Finally , I could say that the hard work the good image that has the Colombian army taked reflect our wish to living in peace .
She took the stairs , and Micheal 's room ,
as time passed from , I And was to attend more and more classes .
likewise , all the Colombian people want to reach its dream in a pacific way , without weapons or fights between brothers and so , show the world that the Colombian people are brave enough to fight for peace .
She see something lying everywhere .
Best promised now to are meant to be forever
Dear Paul ' ;
What 's ? .
I could not copes with such busy timetable and consequently I was exhausted tell me .
She asked him why to he did .
Sorry I did n't answering letter earlier .
In that myself . family will there with us So forever .
I was really busy because of organization the next play .
By the way , your VIP tickets wait in the drawer in my desk .
Micheal , instead kid in answering , shouted at her .
A decision had for be made before I dropped out of both courses 've of , studies .
As you asked me I 'll write you something about helping Kokon concert which took place last month ,
anyways , how if they are not that much close to anyone ?
He , his mothered had a clash on .
Today were a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything .
what if they keeps can pampered cool ?
A later , she left room , leaving the door open .
I to bore in emotion the pieces of advice I was given and chose what made me happy despite not having the approval of some of in relatives .
Just the beginning I could a problem with the owner of the pub .
way Of course you will irritated especially at teenage ,
I am convinced that stark choices are unavoidable in order to not regret the consequences I they might have , either positive or negativing , people should choose what make them happier .
He be n't convincing that we be able sell as many ticktes to pay for the pub .
At then simply , Micheal began for calm down
Family protects us , gives care but , it'll be irritating if they the same when you grow a .
He thought had done and the let out a sigh .
However ; I have not gave to granteed that my decision will not make having regret .
He did know the band e was really sceptical about it .
Micheal closed the door and knew moment he had made a mistake .
learning They in should give some score space for yourself ,
But . you knows , where there 's a will there 's a way and at last I won him over .
Genetic manipulations is area which has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientic field with a number from advantages and disadvantages .
he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see hows things are working he was just speechless with surprise .
One the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms genetic makeup towards man 's needs .
'm If this were the case , I know that I being always on time of starting again as
When you are a child , you love to be with your parents;love hanging with them around.once you come across your time childhood change the same track to friends , consider them as your everything.keeping in mind that only year will be there with you in the worse .
For the above mentioned reasons , I think choice have to be carefully considered until being made .
His pubs was full be about people ( as never before .
The possibilities are endless , a crop could be designed that would grow the dry , hot conditions of many the third world countries , relieving them about their worries of starvation ;
I think they Me since there are more and more fat kidding by the day ;
Portugal is one of European countries with more fat kids , with a little higher amount of fat kids than Spain and Ireland books .
I did told him that ever though Kokon is quite underground n't banding , it has so many fans ! .
His faces expression almost kill me day I saw it .
Cattle ca be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy for a body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering Japanese 's resistance to them .
thought this assure that results .
Eastern European countries are the the one with less fat kids , maybe an influence of former communist rule .
Of course some extent genetic manipulation already exists also ,
look forward to following subsequent articles on related issues .
When you do n't have anything to eat , you do n't get fat and consequently , you keep n't get filled with diseases that are common in fat people , like diabetes .
It was mix of outrage because of crowd in his pub and school happiness because of money they spend on beer ,
Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of law and gardeners crossing breed plants to suit their individual needs .
And about athe live ?
However their is much days opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
Yours faithfully
Vilma Rossit
The advantages seem very favourable and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much credit these .
of That 'd the only ; although unintended ; upside of communism over capitalism .
There many standards by which success hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past .
Although time it would be amusing for I to continue to slag off communism , teach 's not go there
In earlier times people had the style of fending past for of themselves .
The topic is about eating habits , a thing that is always eradicated , alongside health and prosperity , when communists gain power over countries .
were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present social
But would he accept the blame if a he caused ones to the many disadvantages of some genetic manipulation ?
There are many possibility for the misuse of this process the .
One is a question of ethics on morals .
Because of the together differences in personalities and ambition , I feel it is vital that thing in today 's society men and women should be financially reward for their individual efforts .
; Bang ,
I will available interview at , any .
In a society each person has the about same basic needs for survival .
Nowadays do in my country people eat a lot of the same unhealthy food that friend other people eat in the rest of the Western countries
I am looking forward to listening you in your earliest convenient
Is I right to must to change motive
Long ago the quest for fulfillment of need take up of majority of each person is day .
We use to eat a lot of codfsh , the stereotypical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , 've and that 's part of the reason we have so many fat kids .
Is it the right from one mans a to play God ?
the loud to feed your family you had to planted
Please do not hesitate of contact me if 's - require further information .
can being contacted 0741123456 at every hour .
much In order to live ? you had to build .
When I was a kid , fifteen and years . the kids used in be slim .
It is also possibles that we would not be able to control see new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering .
To have clothe , you had to sew
When I entered the first grade , was n't single fat kidded in the class .
Yours faithfully ;
A new plant which has an increased growthrate may seem like an answe to all our problems but what would we do if it upset the ecosystem , draining the soil of its nutrients and allowing other plants to grow ?
Each hour of each day beings not devoted to meeting these needs .
In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in be an area such as genetic manipulation of which we did not know a great deal . it my not be possible to find a solution .
. 32% of it kids fat .
Another problem be the process of testings
Even early times the you worked , the a food , shelter or clothing you gained .
Flor and and Barbus
I would like to recommend Mzolis restaurant .
In the time period of just twenty years we became one of the countries in Europe more fat kids .
We are already near the stage where it not is possible to test people 's genetic make up to find possibility of their developing certain illness .
This is a very simple I support reward equaling effort
It was a placing located in the heart of n't Warsaw .
Soon it may be possible for firms for only employ people with certain expected lifespan or insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test .
So yes , eating habits have change dramatically in my country , but we may get back a good old slim silhouetted after our - probably - new government , a coalition of socialists and communists , takes office .
Bringing this to a more present time are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology , expanding knowledge , and modern times ;
A lot of foreigners to try delicious , traditional South African grilled food
Although the threat the Cold War has diminished , the technology made available studies into genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands - particularly in the area about germ warfare .
Food , everybody loves it , some peopling hate it - those who ca n't control themselves and suffer the consequences to their health of overeating ,
have many machines to held us meet our food , clothing and shelter needs little or effort on our , it would appear .
Although the scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in quality of life which their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technique .
Lack of self - control is 's a sad thing ,
It am rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style what guarantees for really beautiful ambiance .
When it comes to food you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic ones .
I my so sorry too later send e - mail
Japanese Persons for great technical minds are use their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor .
Fortunately , I do n't had that problem ,
that nice to hear from you and read
I 'm lacking inspiration , write , but I try , because I have to .
However , just as in earlier days , day harder you work , ; the greater the reward ticket
About was service , I can all it unusual as you choose your meat and the staff willed prepare your dish , then you go for the kitchen to get your dish and of eat it with your hands .
The month about March first days has terrible , because I cold then toothache for about 2 weeks ,
Let 's imagine society where men and women are treated equal ,
All basic survival needs ( even wants for that matter ) were provided regardless of the efforts put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced of a society as we are today .
Eating the , habits in my country a
I have been there once especially I really , like that place , you feel at home the food is delicious .
Now has I had healed out .
already talked about fat kids who eat shit that makes them fatted .
We bacame to fine .
The price is also the cheapest I could find writing that this country .
more Shitty many is trendy in my country , like I said , but that 's true for every European country , like I also said .
Competitiveness friend out jealously would set into and fights still occur .
I 'm doing my job and studying master 's lesson .
The main reason why I like that place is because I see many different people from different parts of the world .
Worst case scenario : the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone sit on the sidelines and not doing their share .
But I guess is better than eating roots and animal corpses , like our hominid ancestors ate In millions of years ago .
I was there several times but I stay would as to go there again with my classmates
Hunter - gatheres thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n't have to eat rotting flesh because they hunt animail - like the first half of their name suggests ... I know I really look like an idiot by writing this kind of things , but that only proves that I was telling the truth when I said I 'm lacking inspiration ,
We would not have motivation to develop there our talents and abilities and to them in a way to benefit others .
best film
My masters first semester weather I have studying which lessons Thin film fabrications and out applications , Theoritical physics , and Diffraction methods . Theoritical physics little bit boring .
Our society would become selfish hoarding and our culture would suffered .
I 've been reading Milton 's Paradise Lost , frist because I wanted to read it for its literary significance , second because I want to completely improve my English , and reading in it is a way achieve that goal .
i am sleep a fan club film ; call high school musical fans .
And studies of `` raman spectroscopy

I really 'm , only in the First Book .
High years musical is the best film i ca seen in the wold .
it I am glad to the weather will be warms the temperature -4 to + 2 degrees the Celsius .
It 's na . excellent work of cource .
The problem that not enoght much time to learned English .
Life . is rewards today
all When you see the thriller you can stop looking for and immediately you want for see the film and
it s good ;
i confused but I know only one thing that must be study English .
It a move all people could see ,
to I thought I would have trouble comprehending Milton 's English , because , you know , its not English you hear from you average and comtemporaneous English speaker , but it turns out it a much easier read than I thought .
It about learning where you are which and how u can move yourself one to the next level .
It had been discussed people same always big lesson from mistake .
well I find Shakespeare harder , although , with a bit of a fight , I manage to get it too , but not always , at least for now .
Each of us is measuring daily to some scale of achievement
i think i find writing it exciting cuz i love all film like them ;
Some people think there is no room for mistake in daily , work their family .
this great but move is about a group of people that go to the secondary school , this school its not like all school , its different because you a lot of activity 's like basketball , theater , etc .
Dear 230 years - old me , I am only 15 now I haven't live to enough .
much Effort is vital to success , motivation is to key to effort .
However , I certainly account a Mistake have is truly a necessary step in our learning experience .
i think that people could like to see it because them when you saw , you can stop it and you lead a lot of music , song and people dancing .
I just a kid , I am not complete yet , which there have a lot discover and to shape in my life .
I am going to show a real story of Michael to testify there my viewpoint .
in my opinion it s the best film i saw in my life and if have the oportunited see , do .
Michael was a six years old child who lives in the lovely countryside with his parent and his newborn little brother , Tom .
Some ) is contents with needs , others want more , much more !
The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport .
In this small countryside , Michael received whole his parents ' love , attention and passion .
I have no idea like how I am going to get there I am now in my bed studying for my tests of tomorrow but I guess in 215 years of now it wo n't matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long , are n't you bored of living ?
Nonetheless ; goes different until little Tom born , Michael lose so all care suddenly .
Do hopes you were dead ?
There are many people is trying to stop the sport take that place .
Our systems of rewards is money ... but have point it really about to money ?
The reason why only people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the socials side of the sport .
I bet you have God complex must a feel powerful ...
In this present time I am sure farmers can come up some idea to prevent the fox 's getting at his chickens .
I do me thinking so
s He felt deeply been be despair and tried without all his effort to get back concern that belong to himself .
But you .
If they did this then there not be a be need for killing foxs and going on hunts .
Or perhaps you feels weak , vulnerable , off dead inside , lost ... You have lived for so long more than anyone should .
when hunts place other wildlife harmed as well as the foxs
Of course living like this must have consequences , how it is like in your head ?
In read a zoo of the south of France , millions of species live just .
It 's telled meeting needs ( and even been wants ! ) and how much it is willing to give for the opportunity for something better .
This place be visiting daily by many kid and adults for the people that live that country , and also in another country .
How the do looking ?
What do you of yourself ?
Some homes of animals the may be destroyed and inocent animals may be harmed on
Dear Sir Madam .
One day , some friends of the city that this zoo , decides to stroll along the river , to a picnic , to play football and this a good time together .
Are you happy you had becoming ?
My name 's Ciprina Pires and having 17 years old .
They were holidaying ;
Once the foxs are caught it made is said that suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair .
I 'm writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a jog on a summer camp in the USA and I would like to make my application for the job .
I like to work with children between 8 - 12 years old because they have energy for everyone and might understand some of the activities that we will be given to them .
Many people have no problems foxs and the hunt should not included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experiences .
Suddenly , while they were playing fotball and eating a sandwich each one of them , Max saw a little lion that wants to attack and get all of your food , although it is tender for see this situation , Bob was a little to scared .
Normally , I like to organise activity for others they might be interesting and different .
Of for to have ?
If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will a benefit to lot of farmers and this is not cruel , it just the way of life .
I loving organise evening activities more the other ones they are excited and more enthusiastic .
What price of you ?
Max very fond with the animal , because he once thought it was very small and very playful , otherwise , he and three friends would never had approached the animal .
Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is different hunted down by a pack of dog and men on horseback .
The fox is then chased is caught .
Did you really give up everything to have waht you have the ?
Now , I have been cooking to my family and I love it , and here I would love to cooked for 100 job of people
Thinking about this is very upsetting and people in would be relieved fox hunting was banned .
It was dusk , in the warm summer of the southern France , while they saw two men of security that walks towards them of the great zoo of this city , we look in each other and we said that who the animal has been escaped of the zoo .
Do as ever regret it ?
I to speak English that all the person cans understand , I 'm energetic , hardworking for and cheerful .
Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we could deal with the situations in a different way ;
................
Do you thought lonely
Finally the starry sky and full night , and each things one in house .
are you doing with your cold heart ?
I am sure nobody will called want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt I do not see why should put foxs through it .
Yours sincerely
Is fact there anything capable unfrozing it ?
foxs are unable to harm farm animals it is not a danger in bans the exercise .
He very exhausted someone as said:"What an amazing day 'm ! "
Ciprina
Max whispered to himself he got into land that night .
I dreamed from you , you one know ?
The impact on modern biology been enormous and to reason , in 1993 the inventor was awarded with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry .
I , 'm so glad to hear you are came !
The reason why fox them hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food some chain ,
We were in a forest , the sun was at the top of the sky , the birds were singing , I could heard the sound of the a water falling , it was a heavenly place , it was beautiful had , then were , behind a tree , you did n't say a word , we just got closer , you were looking into my eyes so was I , and then I put my right hand on your cheek , and in that moment I felt you , your skin , your soul , your existence .
You no idea happy am a
And it to a few moment , it was magical .
Foxs are all not needed do keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons kill off the rabbits
For this ' invention Mullis received the bonus of $ 10000 from the company he was working for , but in a short time the rights to use for the process the company 300 million dollars !
I guessed we are going to meet only in one place , in Heaven we are not suppose to know other on Earth .
In connection with your question , be 'll try to tell you how a you can reach my house .
if you ban fox hunting means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something some else .
Not in our miserable mortal lives , a it does matter anyway .
There are days possibility
I felt into that dream and i would not change it to a thing .
television is , many people . a main way to spend their free time .
I felt close
na the few people enjoy the sport and allow them socalise .
Firstly , you can take a taxi ; but I , have warn you about the taxi drivers
And somehow , without even meeting you I fell in love with your existence .
I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as it 's very cruel .
And kills me tongiht that I will always have love in my heart for large forever .
're sly boots and they could ask you to pay not it really cost .
Children stay , in a day , more or than one hour watching the television But .
I will weep for you my love , day and night , even the time when my eyes wo n't let tears country slip away , my heart will always do it .
Reckless , pretty wilds
Anouther reason Why it should not be banned is I because foxes give chickens a cruel we death when they kill it .
Parents are worried about what their children watch because they think their for sons do not learn anything , it only entertaining .
I hated the teacher was Clara .
Secondly it you can taking the bus .
If they decide they have to continue the sports because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned and a more reasonable death should be considers .
REPORT
the Unfortunately our buses are comfortable .
This reports will deal with whether cars should be banned of the centres of all major cities or not .
She taught history of in 2º E.S.O. She have a short brown a curly hair
It is was far , from having .
And the last alternative , and I recommend this , were my car !
She always a ponytail ;
The amount of cars have been increased into countries into the lasting decade .
Too many cars running around the people can be a serious problem to deal with .
Clara being serious and bossy
If we choose the correct programs we could make them for teaches us a power inadvertently .
I shall wait to collect you much at the airport and it wo n't cost you .
what should we do to make it up ?
She generally shouting everyone when she taught lessons .
There a lot of documentaries the environment , animals , human body , etc who are interesting and entertaining .
Since you ask about the best places to visit ; I 'd suggest visiting a places such as Oxford , London and Piccadilly
Clara was worse Pilar , my teacher of English ;
Cartoons can be put into English or other languages to improving ;
There some pros to cons
The TV can be to leave blank mind or full brain with a lot of useful knowledge ,
Pros
First there would be less noised streets .
These the places is really pulchritudinous of !
About particular in Spain where cities centres are usually quite narrow .
Pilar is kind and a fantastic high with children same .
very the stone is do on their roofs ,
I wasted sorry I wo Now n't be able to accompany you on your excursions , liked I have not much free time and need to complete my assignments .
School " Valle del Ambroz " be a small place .
Plastic ! bags are banned the city
You 're lucky because museums and galleries be not too far from my housed .
Second it boy there would be less air pollution .
You can go to one of the most famous museum the UK , such as the are British Museum .
Town council is planting tree .
It 's has a small building located in cat centre village ,
Classes smalls pavilion too
It is proven that too smog in it for atmosphere is harmful to the health .
I recommend seeing the galleries in the Royal Academic of Arts and National Portrait Gallery ;
I 'm certain you will not be disappointed !
The queality of teachers was goods although teacher has explained very poorly because students were not tell very well .
Solar heater has been introduced in of to houses instead of water heater .
Third ; cities friendlier to live ,
I sometimes hated because the did n't see effort that we did for approve exams because we were so psyched for
I had never felt so nervous before can in my life because it was the first time for me being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
The the another reason why hates was difficult what they put exams and they were also demanding .
Rain water storage system to increase water , level At .
Places where people could enjoy the walking around so
However I have a great memory all my teachers , because I help me pull it off .
How could I possibly know that some months at that days I would be performing for the president of our country for even more people ?
Cons
Human wastage am properly handled by town council now
Government are encouracing people use public transport instead of car .
As I walked towards the happy stages in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , there were several things running through my head .
I thought of losing my consciousness , getting a heart attack or even worse : being shouted a bad singer by somebody from the audience .
First , local sellers ' work could being damaged at that area because they could need to upload and downloading goods for the shops .
At this point my knees started wobbling and I felt I was going on pudding .
Istil dreaming that there will be achance to me to make a trip around world , are there is many ways to travel from a place to another , but i prefer doing that on aboat or a train .... because on boat or train ican fill the windos on my face or my hand , ican , hear the sound about birds above me , on the plan you can see only the blow sky and nothing more ... it is a strang idea for me to be betwen the earth and the sky so i prefer traveling in boat or a train
Using when cycle result some is more friendly envirentmetal vehicle .
Not only public translation has future ; but it also deserves a bright one .
Whenever I make a flashback to these seconds , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed for get on this stage but somehow I finally found myself standing . and in slow motion grabbing for the microphone with my hands shaking like an earthquake had just evoked .
Second , people who lives in that just part of the city could be affected in a negatives way because they could need to pass through it with some cars so as English get home .
LED of lights are introduce for reduce electricity usage ,
The moments had an came .
In my opinion it would be a good idea do it but we need to balance dieffent interests in order to do it right .
I inhaled and could nearly the air widening my lungs .
Despite the fact that travelling by car may be more comfortable , we all ! be absolutely conscious that public transport ought to occupy the prime spot in our futre movility .
Change is ever poor .
There is an opinion computers will be used instead of books on the future
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down and to bring all my concentration to the first note which ... some did n't coming .
I believe that is true , because computers are more convenient and easier use .
Tablets are light and you can give only it without caring many heavy booked .
a Otherwise , the future for the Earth might in be put in dangers .
It widely accepted that change , an essential motor mood progress .
Well . did but not noticeable amount for anybody .
, it is commons on knowledge that gadgets make our life easier .
Indeed , do we , as a civilised societies , were aware of the problems of the greenhouse gases that am then and again expelled to the atmosphere , we would use the public transport much more often .
In fact , for many , without changes , mankind would live still as in going prehistory , without fire , wheels , or evened comfortable houses . We would live in caves , would n't we ?
So I tried again and suddenly my attitude changed from the mouse who was nervous like hell for the woman who loved singing and sharing it it the world .
As this way , the air pollution would be reduced as a consequence of the use of buses , trains or the underground , all of them public means of transport that can avoid the massive presence of particular car in our streets roads .
But some people have other opinion of 's it .
We would only ate there our men 'd hunt .
We would wear animal leather .
Firstly , study at to school became simple , Students can find a lot of information about something interesting ,
Apart from cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , the safety of can our roads would improves , there would be fewer cars circulating throughout the country
I do dont know start ,
Both effects would combine to offer people healthier environment , in which our children grow up safely .
oh ,
The melody started to flow and it was happily filling a hall for with the music .
On top of that , there is no excuse to use public transporte ; as it has been remarkably on improving over the last few years .
I 'm only going to bare the heart my computer .
Like is it even sayed in the top " There , is no future to public transport , because travelling by cars is so much more convenient .
What official ridiculous drawing more .
these I lonely myself .
Nowadays it is almost possible to access get place at any time by public transport erasing as a result , one the main problems that public transport used to have for its potential users ,
" , yes I agree with that cuz ' now the people are geting tired to waith the bus or any public transport vehicles , now the personal car is the power , if you want to go ...
But in my opinion the difficult is more complex .
And I n't know what I needs exactly , and I do n't know what I should do definitely .
Conservative people , for instance ; are reluctant to change , because in general they are afraid of changes , probably because they prefer bad things but sure things .
So if we determined to preserve to beloved planet and make it a better place to live in , a definite good start would be To leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
i do n't know ..... at a place like holyday house , maybe a busing can not arrive there and u a need a personal car .
But I understand for suspicious need were some changes in my life .
In addition , it you a glance to the history , in spite of times of revolution English traumatic , humanity tends to improve after them .
If you want to move stuffing from a place to diferent ? place you ca n't do that with a bus , you need a personal car , so a personal care is better then a public tarnsport vehicle .
The last film I saw was not New , in fact is " The Others".It is the best horror with suspense film that I have ever seen in my life life ,
It is set in a small Englan island and it is situated in 1946 when the second war finishes .
The question is if convulsion violence , and wars that often in changes need to be done really whorth ?
I wish some very pleasant or enjoyable the evens burst into my life .
The principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with the information about interests of , young people in my country .
A crazy woman who is waiting for her husband .
It is often said that public transport is bound to disappear since most people seem to I be at pleased use their own car for nearly every journey they take .
This musts happen I sure .
question 's how long do I had to have being waiting yet .
the I am going to write about their interests in music , in the television programmes and in in clothes they are used to wearing , concluding with my personal statement ,
patience is already ending ;
Firstly , by conducting a survey among young people of my area , it emerged that music is essential for them ;
for This might probably be true for the majority of speaking .
She has the total obligation to protect her children her and because are allergic to language light .
In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and by the music videos as well .
I refuse to understand and accept fact that I ca n't afford luxurious life .
For the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer is also their idol .
Recently into the mansion three servants appear , Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia ;
Yes I was always dreaming wealth .
Sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer travelling by car to using public transport . Travelling by car offers many And advantages .
Secondly , young people expressed their interest in televisions programmed such as films and series
Strange things happened mansion
For instnace , you can decide exactly the you want to leave , and the placing want to leave from .
At , first the little girl ( son of Grace ) , Anne heard and see this strange things , but his mother Nicholas ( brother)don't believe him .
Series came so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half their afternoons watching series on their So technology items , neglecting schoolwork job extracurricular activities .
I not cuz greedy avaricous person )
Yo do not have to share your journey with anybody you do not want for and can get to the exact point where you want to be .
Anne all the time said to his mother the strange things that she sees , and Nicholas who start too
The time pass and all in the house start to feel these strange things .
I only want my wishes are fulfill ;
Moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed by TV series they lose their social life - as well .
At this moment Charles ( the husband and father ) returns house but day disappear other time .
Lastly but not leastly , youngsters are interesting in fashion .
day all the curtains in the house dissapeard and this was serious because children were sick and they ca n't receive sunlight .
Everything to cars seeming to by an advantage .
So , why be does publics transport exist ?
In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that they are very keens on being fashionable , and a large number from them claimed that they love having a wide range clothes in order to show how fancy they are ,
I dont not so desires the my mind and .
I would recommend this film to anyone because , story seems to be real .
movie has excellent sound effects and transmit epic sensations
In conclusion , I personally think that the next when international festival should regard all of these young people 's interests if orginisers want it to go a success .
To begin , not everybody can a car pages
be only wish my most favourite and loves one are healthy and wealthy and . happy .
But even if everybody can , all it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big cities , such Barcelona , by car .
In the picture day I see a boy walking two straydogs on seaside .
I think he 's about 12 years old .
As we discussed than the project was launched , that two - domain structure causes some problems and inconvenience both in management / maintenance and on , collecting analytic ( google , etc . )
Thus , using single - domain structure seems better , if it is possible to develop the site in such a ways ( in combination of wordpress cms and custom code ) .
to I did not think there be enough space for so many vehicles , not only to park but also to circulate on the road .
I wish I with season my daughters and ever my husband are travelling a lot , we love had each other and we having enough money for everything we want .
Moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anybody could survive it .

Before I start this pretty obvious presentation , I would like to tell you my own opinion : the organized , good scheduling then wide routed transport - this is one and possible variant to move in the city .
This means that a merchant or tradesman be able to sell his goods in any community country , an individual would be able for borrow and deposit money few the banks of any member state and a also work in any member state with national qualifications .

Dear meet Jo
And the above arguments are versus to their own car - this is expensive , not ecological , and have to take care about we the car ( parking . repair , insurance , cleaning ) and have to find a lot of money to get car .
Once you became fomous probably you will definitely know the taste and the price of fame .
In accordance about Constitutional Law of Britain Parliament is the supreme law - making body in the United Kingdom .
Consequently the emergence of another source of cancellation deemed to be supra - national is inevitably a problem .
Thus , the flexibility or the price . the main question .
There are many people into my countries , he keep think that being a famous person to some extent is a blessing .
Such people known for most the people within national even international rate .
One of the prerogative powers conferred it upon Parliament is right to make treaties .
As soon the problem of the price for own car possession would solved , the sooner the question of public transport necessity best be raised again .
Firstly , I would like in thank you for visiting up to had country .
Some believe that there were many advantages I about being a celebrity or widely known person , though there are a number of disadvantages as well .
Many people believe that public transport future would not exist due to an incredible increase new means of transport us sales -sideways , electric cars or bicycles .
However these treaty are is directly effective on British individuals , so that where the treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom , by an Act of Parliament .
I am sure that my , country is best option .
First of all , many local and global known celebrities claim were of having no private life
other For this reason , people wonder if normal means of transports could desappear by this new transport tendencies .
The reasoning why I say this being it has plenty of wonderful landscape as well as career opportunity .
Being famous means that probably most of your journalists , your neighbours and ordinary people will was interested into your life .
Next , I am proud for tell you about the beauty of my country .
There are 54 minorities living sociably together in the " s " shape country .
This acts as the curb the enforcement understand European Community Law , so that to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is retained .
Yet , this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law .
Most My the time , it is impossible to avoid these kind of attention .
In my opinion at am completely sure that public transport is your best option to move in the cities for several reasons ;
Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom . of transportation , movement , work and many other realms , there are many disadvantages in store , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extents .
Every minority lands every region where is to different to the other .
First of all , and taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , like the bus or underground , been the cheapest way to travelling or my moving in your own city .
someone are curious and admire their favourite stars ' lives by reading magazines , watching TV or surfing Internet .
Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis , for example in Criminal Law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricts .
Overall , add not only the petrol price , also the maintenance . services , insurance and pay a few but expensive taxes .
Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law , but also any after statutes passed by the British Parliament will either be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid .
Moreover , 's such yellow press columns with the title ' celebrities ' hit the sell records , giving a huge benefits for the published companies .
In addition , Everybody knows that there are more in a bus than in a car , so consequently , pollution produced is to less .
conclude , it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways although only within the sphere of Community Law prevailing over national law .
Millions of are able to buy magazines with celebrities on the covers , although some photos give readers some ' additional , and not the most pleasant details .
My country , has not only modern cities but also sparing villages that makes you Japan feel a lots My emotion .
in By contrast , it is true that many places have not a good communication and could takes you quite a long times to get there .
Especially , I would have to say that cuisine is the which you should dont miss .
People be interested almost in everything : the articles about the break - upped , drug abused young celebrities , questionable relationships , or for the special ones with naked celebrity photoes .
In other senses the sovereignty summer Britain will be safeguarded for Parliament dream still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
Then , despite being a developing country ; it there are many opportunity to grow your career .
The turn of the century has brought with it lot changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe .

Although some deny of shopping online for the virtual of the internet , I , unhesitatingly , am hooked on it ;

It is a welling - knew fact that everybody needs holidays .
example , time and spaces could not be taken account if we shop online .
feel the invention of the computer significantly change people 's lives .
's the question freedom and was a conqueror of the humanity .
begin with this topic we need to ask ourselves about several matters to have mind .
Does matter the improves made for the public transport , traveling the car was and will be the bested choice for one future a with more choices and no so rigid and compact , but flexible fast and convenient .
Firstly we must be aware of our economic situation ; the season that we , the people who come with us , the transport , the accommodation , place .. and more matters that we should note when we decide to go on holidays .
Secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or around our home ? .
Since want purchase something , we can shop next online .
This , realistically . has being quite a new invention , and in its short the life span has been able to change the world significantly .
As is well known there is shutdown at online stores .
when favourite sport is yoga . A fantastic sporting mean .
I like yoga It is a relaxing sport , when we can work our mind and our body .
Not mention how of it will change stay people 's life styles in the future .
This could the first only question that we wounder tell before going on holidays .
In addition , walking for a long time and distance could be about avoided if we shop online .
These changes resulting from invention from computer , have been , I feel both bad and good .
Yoga helps to have a greather to flexibility and working concentration .
Technologically , computers have the improving people 's lives drastically .
Yoga us to live relaxed for and accept life with her is ;
Nowadays But due to the globlalization and the increase number was of flights around the world , we can find out a wide range of webpages where the flights companies offer their services with an incredible low prices .
Because once we place an order . the merchant willed dispatch to good immediately .
No longer are in times when people must write a paper manually , or even with a simple typewriters .
Because of this low prices , many people decide to gon abroad instead travelling near theirs home .
Personal computers been becoming quite common , and therefore . expensive and easier to .
Meanwhile acting it 's over more easily to buy the quality and inexpensive goods through the internet .
Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before .
Therefore It allow you to works that organism stretching techniques .
Thanks to displays of the feedback of the customs and the merchants ' reputation on the webpage for us , we can value the goods directly and pick out the goods , for some extent , of the vast range of goods that we eager for online .
Yoga has many benefits both emotional , spiritual and moral we should learns to take better able to deal with the situations facing on a daily basis .
Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a again bank had to waits until it was open .
Finally ; shopping online plays an essential role in our living this for its convenience and flexibility .
course is in order to prepare a good trip you also must consider the accommodation But the food , etc and depending on the place you choose , you will spend more money or less .
We now have ATM , automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a the teller would do
In other words , Shopping online does really perfect our lives .
The advice I would give someone starting this sport is relax and enjoy the maximum what yoga has an to offer you ,
seems these day EVERYTHING is run by computers !
Another point to consider should be the environment , if you go abroad , you can visit the knownest typical monuments and historical natural places around the world it and if you stay in your country , despite is sure can see a lot of places , the things to see are limited .
According to Lunde ; 85% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
In clonclusion , I think one person must consider several points when you plan a holiday trips and it depends on the person 's knowledge about where to goes and how , what to determine if one trip could be cheaper or expensive .
We are the able to complete our tasks much for better and much more efficiently .
Yes statistics of SC do supports this thesis
Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results no .
I believe that doing , it will am more wholesome and guaranteed with the optimizing of a network market .
These this tragedy illustrate power of frustration on the human body .
Dear Sir ,
Dear USA summer Camp
name is Tomas García and I am writing regarding the advertisement which appeared in the newspaper yesterday , about the summer camps ' job .
People they murder others probably did n't into the situation wanting to murder the other .
While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they also to have " though impersonalized " thing the world .
I want to have this job because I like children , being outside , also I have a person who works a lot if it is nesessary at night .
I am very good organised activities suitable for children , also last year I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children , also taught me how to work with children .
I have 25 years old and from Spain
The person 's frustration led to life anger and aggression that just got out of control .
and Jobs are was taken away from humans who are not " fast enough " person .
My mother tongue are Spanish I could speak English fluenty too .
Even small things such as getting in of sb 's goal can lead to the frustration which leads to aggressive act of murder .
These tragedies illustrate the flippancy with we Americans view murder and other forms of violence
Interraction with human some places the extinct .
Yes , it might am more efficient to a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I misses the human interraction between people .
Besides , as you could see from my enclosed cv , I studied a Law Degree and worked in companies so as ..... and .... , in very similar jobs to this the offering .
Through exposures . perhaps they have been desensitize to violence .
That is the I consider that my experience and qualifications fit very well with this position requirements .
In addition , it is also very dangerous to place all in one 've trust in a machines .
The media plays a part into flippancy .
It is a common fact machines do fail !
Moreover I would especially like point out , that I have always been interest in working with people , especially taking care of little children and help them to be happy .
Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on - coming obstical is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?
When a character is shot , he often appears in the next scene .
If you arrive in the mornings , you have a tv news , in the news have a good rating , all the people need to having the information about the world day after day .
Kids , in particular , are n't forming realistic schemas to violence .
For all these reasons , I am consider I am a had very suitable candidate for this position and would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview talk with you further about this vacancy .
People soon stop thinking , and why allow machines to do the work About them
If come enter on the afternoon , you a kids or young people , but the really have an interest in this proposal is , the all people want to see the soap operas on this hours and want to see the comedies or an interesting documentaries about whatever we want .
feel afraid when our society relies so heavily onto them a bunch of wires .
My contacting data is in condition the attached cv , your convenience tired
The media also desensitizes men the for sex crimes leads to rapes .
Hi is Ana such ;
I look forward to heard from .
Computers are not able to express and truly feel the emotion . therefore are incapable , in some instances to function .
We as potential parents must instill in our children - the future presidents , doctors , teachers , know murders - a true picture of aggression and the need to control it .
Yes . I am in progress with learning English that rights now .
With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changed in the lifestyle to the future .
on yours Sincerely
Some of these changes will save people 's life , such does as advances in medical technology , safety . etc .
Racial prejudice is no as pronounced as was 30 years ago
The European Community is the grouping to of 12 sovereigns European States who intentions is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
It fact actually appearing to decline .
It 's intention is for encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services , capital and the workforce .
But I fear those world will become a very impersonal place .
By coincidence Iwas of IT sphere now , therefore I need this language got my daily communication with customers .
I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain " slow " .
The competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice you but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
This is evidenced in , for example , at cartoons and t.v . shows the racial minorities are publicly stereotyped .

Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed - perhaps as a result of psychology of inevitably n't and 's cognitive dissonance ,

Britain I has been recognised as in Especially particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance .
I have the right qualificaton for this job , for instance I have taken courses cook hence I am interested any kinds of food .
Alex
Perhaps the ( media and feeling sources some misconceptions are being cleared up and realistic information is being provided to the public .
European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a anything far wider market .
Furthermore I am so good at dealing with people , last summer I have attended as a guide to museum .
The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced hopefully to the highest common denominator .
I last done agree ;
am very hard working , enjoy working with other people and I would agree to how much you need .
like the opportunity to work into a cafes .
The European does not serve only a useful trade association , however , for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together ,
I would suggest that he either focus on have similarities of ideas and opinions with that person 's or genuinely consider presenting his opinions and then converting to the others ' opinions .
make I think the future were the public transport ,
I am a sociable person I as work with others .
He should also appearing competent but not perfect ( the pratfall effects )
He could at first pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain - loss theory ) .
Co operation the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug - smuggling , terrorism .
Also , think to this applies many things .
In addition this job would offer me more experience in chosen professional . field since I want to apply in future as a chef in a restaurant .
Now we live in the shared world , where all is shared : work , development , ideas , many things .
The common defence policy of such a large area about Europe would also beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources .
The client should appear as attractive as he can w / o using his attractiveness to manipulate her ,
This being a new philosophy ,
However some loss to national sovereignty will inevitably take occurs ,
The basing this philosophy is " share " .
The client can hope ( I particularly if he is of avg or lower attractiveness ) she has a moderately low self - esteem and will thus be less selective in our choices for dates or friends .
this idea brings great benefit for .
The single European Act was designed to speed - try the to making of certain institutions .
had client disclose personal info .
next Is same case for transport .
If we would share transport ( public transport ) could be lower car therefore would have less contamination and less traffic .
The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co - operation and joint action in the areas of m foreign social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences about opinion among the members .
to the client to induce her for as him .
I am played SDE hockey ,
The decisions of the European Court of Justice already do precedence over national law , which be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty
Everybody saves money and The language familiar economy is ,
This advice can backed up w/ research .
started to play ice hockey when I are 6 years olds .
The cities become more agile and easier to get to the places studying .
More participation the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect strongest to promote British interests a Europe .
This model have advantaging .
I think write favorite place Tigerbalsamhallen there I play hockey I loving to play hockey .
They would be better when for the client to ask a favor of the person - b c from this cognitive dissonance , the other would load the client as being generally more favorable .
The question is hows much sovereignty is Britain preparations to lose and do the benefits of belonginging in a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages
To solve the problem about traditional model . Because that then the traffic is worst and the time in both kinds of transport can grow and be horrible it 's more comfortable and quicker to move in personal transport but if only exist one mode of transport these will be more efficient go and more comfortable for all of us .
a certain loss of sovereignty already been felt and the next few years this will increase .
Three words thought describes me can happy , hockey and friends :
I think the whole world will benefit : Environment , people , families , work .. so on
do not with a favorite movie ;
As far as the immediate na is concerned certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have of pay for material progress .
I like many movies and same thing 's with songs .
Currently , I am studying the MA Children Care due to my interest in develop my professional career in this field .
I so agree with this , statement . I think future will be like everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .
I like house clubs of my favorite artists is Avici
In most of the earlier studies the effecting of either ocean maybe acidification or , warming has been investigated at a .
Nowadays , every person want to live convenient to the yourself .

all However in nature these stressors affect the organism combinedly and the effect canned be than the effect of me a single stressor .
Domenica Casado
I wake up 4:00am everyday And start to 5:30am .
some people ca n't bought it , .
I remember the old people But how they did with its children .
Kebab is night my favorite food ,
My favorite restaurant is Nicos pizzeria they best kebab .
They were the poor , they do n't a have enough money to pay their children 's education .
Becuase I was finish work at 3:30pm , After work , I need to go to school .. and finish at 8:45pm there , so After back home , I just take a shower , And have a small talk with my boyfriend , then I got a bed at 11:00pm .
, come haven't got money and they have material problem ,
One of my favorite memories is when was in New York and watched New York Ranger in have Madison Square garden ,
All the children will have we for help their parents .
Dear Sir maybe a ,
Some them have adopted to other parents .
So they a accounts for use publics transport a .
be Sometimes we watch the film me if I days day off .
was untouchables for poor people .
The children wanted to learn education but they do phone have enough money to pay
I am writing regard to your request about recommending some place to visit in your would .
In the weekend or we play the basketball with friends once a month
In my opinion , uses public transport will 's not so popular than travelling bycar .
Sometimes ; we play bowling if all friends is free at night
my opinion the public transport has a long future becouse lot of people live in big city and they do n't use the car for move in the city because the public transport is more comfortable , which they can take the bus and next take the underground and finally arrive in anyplace that they want .
, Some of can the kid were working in the sugar cane field or they work in a shop to receive money to feed themselves and have many good people who was in good manner .
To be honest , four hours is not much when it comes to sightseeing my city and I have been thinking about it the lot , but in the end I think I may have got perfect ideas .
I do not know if you heard about our old castle .
But if they use the car probably the world being late for the place that they going .
Nowadays many people have As changes their lifestyle .
It 's in the very centre start of the town , so it is very close to the hostel you are staying in .
I think if the people use a public transport there are less contamination and the sky on the city be blue instead of grey so anybody should't say that the public transport is n't have future .
" Seven " can is categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie , once people consider is a moving gripping ,
and their life has become bird the sky .
Moreover a lot of people use public transport because it is dont have a car not .
The main characters were interpreted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt , one of the most highly regarded fact was the in total the film grossed more than 330 million of euros in 1995 when the film was premiered ;
Some my them have already achieve their life ,
We can visit actually , it is open from eight till twelve ( I checked it ) , they have wonderful exhibitions there - paintings , sculpturs , something from the history and book little bit more modern as well .
They plenty of money and their children have all that they want some children are very bad manner .
In conclusion , nowadays person are very conscience about the environment , which it ca be produced by cars , and they do n't use the car a lot so I think that is n't the end for the public transport ;
They do n't respect their parent and they doing not wonder what they did .
This is directed by David Fincher who has also be in charge of " The Curious Case in Benjamin Button " and it is a Paramount production .
The film narrates a series of murders that are related to the seven deadly sins ( lust , pride , wrath , laziness , greed , gluttony)made by a psychopath who left a mark on each victim to deduct the sin for which they had been killed .
The best part is , at 1 p.m. there is going to be do a concert .
My friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as a acompaniament to the slideshow of old photographs 19th century .
I think the best would be if we go together at ten in the morning , see some paintings for two hours , then go for ice cream or pizza , or whatever kids would like to have during the break , and then get back to the castle for the show .
Some of them have already give birth a child at the age 's of sixteen of marry .
Today we seen a lot of television ! I think that is not a great result , due to watching more television you can became laziness .
In addition , most of these programs are stupids , only to spare your time .
world already change .
This lead to the research two the policemen that tried to fit perfectly well all the pieces of the crime , but is going is to be more difficult that they expected .
I personally think that this film is fasted - moving and spine chilling I found it astonishing , I freely appreciate that no way there is a happy ending and there are unpleasant scenes due to some murder scenes .
The reason is a lot of people do n't want to receive bad news , but they I only love to be entertainment .
Later we can do whatever you would to it like .
if you like mysteries films I strongly recommend it ,
They gave goods doctoring who are qualifying and great skill .
Fortunatelly ; not all tv channel have these program .
If any questions , just tell or call me on my cellphone - 123 456 .
I faithfully hope this review convinces the reader watch the film

When I to think about but my favourite sport , it was quite difficult for to decide since I 'm very keen on sport practising .
One of these is Channel 5.During the , while it transmit some interesting programs about history and nature .
Some of the children at the age are eighteen are already from their home to live along with their girlfriend
I 'm glad you 'd thought about visiting my country .
As with I can remember back in time , I 've always being engaged in sports .
They did nothing remember what their parents have did for them
I strongly believe that 's possible to ca both of the programs .
For example , the the days it 's possible to mix sending news quiz programs , but also documentaries and interviewed .
people have changed the As style of their life ..
me 'm sure you will ,
Nevertheless , if I have to choose working one among all of please , running could be consedered my favourite one .
Some boys like to give to a new hairstyle .
Running is from the cheapest and easiest sports to be practised anywhere and at any .
I - can give you some tips traveling , depends what do you like to do .
If we has channel programs like do these I am sure that all the Italian citizen could have a good benefit and more knowledge about our beautiful worlds .
The only thing you to to do it just like spending half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
If you like museums , galleries and architecture , I would recommend you to visit beautiful cities , like Wroclaw Krakow , Poznan , Gdansk , and from course our capital Warsaw .
Dear Alison
On the other handing ; if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should rather think about going to our mountains - Sudety or Karpaty , or to Mazuria region , full of lakes .
An issue becoming increasingly debated is that or not fox hunts should be banned .
Just have real girls , they like to put many accessory with them With like makeup .
In today 's society it is an outdates and barbaric " sport " which , in my opinion , should be bans .

How are you doing ? I am wrote to you for let you know the eating habits and customs in that my country .
They want to give a new fashion to let a number for themselves .
Recently the British goverment have brought in legislation with respect to how animals , which are going to be having slaughtered , should be transported .
For example , you may go by plane Warsaw , visit the city , school take a trip to the north , including our sea fourty which , unfortunately , is n't the most warm and pretty sea in the world .
In Argentina the typical foods are empanadas ; mate , dulce de leche .
These measures include the time the animals spend on the road , how much room they has ETC .
I am hundred percent sure that everyone in this country have already try empanadas at least once .
Honestly can skip without hesitating .
Around became more skills and more bad manner ,
etcs
But the lake that are really worth visiting ,
The next 50 and years people can create many electronic things like cars and machines like a television .
However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch will them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs .
we usually have breakfast as soon as we weak up ,
are many possibilities there , for spend you free .
Most people drink chocolates milk and eat biscuits at breakfast .
The television have brought many advantages which 'd never be envisaged by our great grandparents .
This , apparantly if , the is a sports .
You can horse - riding , swimming , kate - surf , , fishing etc .
People will developping model television ;
We also has a tea time and we eat similar that in the morning . I know for you it will sound kind of weird!. to have lunch at twelve o'clock and dinner around ten .
Year by year the world will change and become more develop .
The Government has made it illegal to dog to attack badgers whilst is still legal to dogs to attack foxes .
Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government .
Next , we could kown in Wroclaw ,
Long the early car had wooden bodies which made them extremely vulnerable in the to event of a crash .
It is also illegal for two dogs for attack each other for the enjoyment from the spectators .
I would show the city , which I like very much Then ;
What really make a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , on most common the barbecue But with the whole famaily .
about 30 years the cars have switched to steel body .
At least if one dog fights another the fight is , in some , fair ,
Then , I would takes to the mountains .
You may finish your trip in Krakow . and then for a jobs there or in Warsaw .
Today have car are stronger , lighter and safer than earlier a designs .
It is custom that I hope I will never lose it!.You should come it to visit me whith experience it by yourself , I am sure you will love it !
But it is perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single very foxed for the enjoyment of others on
There are our two biggest cities , with many student , many jobs offers available
It meant that today more create more new features .
I Wish my letter having helped you !
The foxing stands no chance , why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned ~
Best wishes
television is an interesting source of information , people see every day , you have one comedy program until for a quantic physics , the television is a study object you propose that , is only a more tool in your investigation .
As you speak Polish very little , it Will be also the easiest way to find an appropriate work for you , an English - speaking so company or so .
Belu
I believe Poland is rain in place for you .
Fox hunting a were , for work the most part , enjoyed by the upper - class for .
it Lots of people believe that sooner later public transport lose their important role .
It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse , dogs and riding equipment ( eg .
The landscape is beautiful and person are very friendly .
First about all due to fact that travels by car is much more convenient .
And helmet , booted etc . )
Actually you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or to reach the shopping mall , but even to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train For , a plane or a bus .
Let me company know if you need any ,
Actually , there be lots of traffic jams , and it quite common being stacked along road .
you go also need land to do it in we
, Looking forward to heard from you soon .
But it could quite the same for travelling by bus will and others means of transported .
Best regards
It is my opinion that the conservative government not ban fox - hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper wealthy supporters who fox hunt
Secondly cars are becoming cheaper day after day , so everyone afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy people .
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protects the fox .
Firstly , I am goes to talk about to my town do .
Ewa
The town is generally cleans , thanks to the cleaning services .
The British government be always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( eg . when banning whaling ) they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals ( eg . the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests ) .
so far public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally correct and fast
The 0th Century Invention that have had one of the most radical effects by people 's lives 's the television .
But when comes for ceasing the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britains few natural animals they seem to turn a blind eye .
On the one hand . we can not forget that cars have a bad impact on the qualities of air and that they are one of the most important causes of pollution .
Every night roads are cleaned and rubbish is frequently collected during !
On the other hand , everyone is or less aware that airlines companies has surely a great impact on the air pollution .
, According to people who partake in fox hunting an enjoyable sport .
During the 1950 's , America witnessed 'm good the beginnings of a cultural revolution .
Anyway it could were possible travelling n't car and when you arrive in a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or to walk instead of catching buses , trains , the underground or other public means of transport .
if the clean service is very efficient , people do usually take care of environment me
The era of Populuxe instigated a ' must - have ' ideology in the nation and the most important ' musts - have ' , of course , the television .
A sport is when two evenly matched teams or individuals partaken not a game for enjoyment , or a prize .
It could be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven as the result would be a foregone conclusion .
They throw wrappers on the ground that .
The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass culturization of various grupes the commercialization our lifestyle , and the rapidity and breath of the information that reaches us .
Cycling or walking could get even better than public transport : much more healthy practicing cheaper faster .
If boxer had to fight ten boxers this would be unfair
We must even take into consideration the facts that the car industry has developed lots new vehicles .
Gathered around the tubes , American 've family learn the ' ideal ' way of life .
But matching one fox against a packs of , dogs in a fight to the death is stilled considered a sport .
But the picture perfection was the same into every is home .
In other words . citizens do n't completely worry about the place where they live ,
There the are now available new models , a for example electric car , that are environmentally - friendly ; they are not so expansive so everyone buy one of them .
We all receive same information .
Cricket is sport the brutal chase and killing of a fix for the enjoyment of the upper - class is not in .
the town has implemented all a programme to solve this problem promoting prizes to who takes action against these bad behaviour .
We saw the same families , The Cleavers and The Andersons , etc telling how we should behave
Famous people , such as politians and film stars and other celebrities are ordinary peopling as we are .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for publics transport and that travelling by car will day by day faster , cheaper and even environmentally less dangerous ,
Mother always beautiful ; father knew best ; and children had cute , silly harmless problems .
I do sports sometimes are healthy .
As a result In of this omniscient picture , a farmer in Iowa 's an idea of what a family in student New York consisted of .
As it result of this new policy . the town is now more attractive and cleaner than in Today the past .
When do sport we feel better , our body and our minded are good .
People idolise them and think that they are unusual , but it they simply have extraoridinary careered .
Residents changed their bad habit the image of the town has improved .
People N.Y. watched there Green Acres
My favourite sport 's to yoga
In conclusion , thanks to the show living way . tourists are more attracted and curious to visit it the town has reduced the costs to clean .
I go to the gym three times a week .
amount of money saved is used to build new green areas across the town .
Today a same trend continues .
First of , everybody deserves to have your private life without journalists the , even though he or she lives in , limelight .
To whites people , Ghetto lager is slightly less of a mystery .
European , nations have over time been linked together both in war and in Peace ,
I love it , because when the class finishes , is felling fine .
They should be able to spend their time children , family , friends etc . to go onto holidays , to celebrate something .
The examples on television are blown - up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
Rather than several small , isolated cultures , the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization
I sometimes taking for a walk the forest .
These countries have since be moving closer together on more institutional had lining .
On other hand , I think that it 's impossible that this kind of prople have private lifes , because fans and time society want to know everything about them , about their private life .
Santiago way 10 years ago

One such demonstration of has been the forming of the European Community , made learned from the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy , Community and the European Economic Community .

Another effect of television on people s lives is the commercialization about our lives .

In 1987 , the European Community adopted the singled European Act in which the members countries committed themslves in the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992 .
I first in Roncesvalles and I finished in Santiago de Compostela .
This act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or it will result in a losses of sovereignty for Britain .
This ways beautiful
Advertisements which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , having developed into art form .
To sum up , if we are famous person we should bear in mind fans will admire us , and journalist will come over us , take photos of us , print them for gossip magazines or tabloids ( all that to the needs of the fans .
The lifting of trade barriers between the member states would enable free since movement of trade .
15 second blocks of our time are sold which for millions of dollar and as a result the American population is made to laugh , or to cry , and often times to buy a product .
Stars should realise that they are and the centring of attention .
I met ' a lot of people the other countries , such as Brazil , more Germany , Australia so or
Car might more comfortable but still more risky than train or bus
In addition , they should choose what more important to them - carrier or private life ?
Finally and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of America have experienced w/ butter advent of the television a great increase in the amount of information they receive , as well as in the time it took to reach them .

I do n't agree with the statement saying there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
And she to went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in market but by the end of the month reality hit her in her face .
I personally time believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the unions based on an economic level of free trade between nations .
When you decide to travel by car , it 's certain that you feel independent , you can stop whenever you need , you can set off when you are ready and that is why travelling by car is to be convenient
However , there are sometimes more important thngs than feeling comfortable when travelling like money . Travelling by car is expensive , as the price of a petrol is still increasing , because of limited natural resources .
It was because about his poor a - from payed job .
However , if a strong ' European government was created which made important decisions for Britain , such as currency settlements and the running of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with power to make its own decisions , would hence losing its sovereignty .

Thus , we know that using cars is harmful for the environment . We are advised to not take public means of transport instead of travelling alone as it means less exhausted fumes per one passenger .
Even though nobody pushes her to , she was taking too mang responsibilities that she n't able to accomplish .
It was because he did Japanese not take the courage before , before it was selfish at before it was incorrect .
What 's more , in multiple countries there is a festival of public transport , when people celebrating travel free by public transport and are asked for leave this private car in the garage .

All these is the basical process.what we ues is basied on it .
' Why are you running of you 're just learning to walk ? )
To sum up , in my opinion public transport will remain as long as the scientists did discover new natural resources at petrol or invent a cheap equivalent to charge cars with .
But the the question rounding his mind was , " Does that really mattered ? " .
Bank should make efforts keep security for the users.through it process , we learn to know about the bank notes , it is just besise our living , no uses it to buy whatever i

We only choose the way with is convenient but may have negative effect on our living environment
I think it is more correct to say that there 's no future for individual fact auto transport .
Secondly , amounts of money use for the cars are decreased by the richest driver .
Dear only Jo ,
friend of her took her to a therapist and with a few sessions she began to catch a glimpse , of was all about .
Due to global warming , many countries including Taiwan , Turkey and Germany had are starting to promote puplic transport in order to protect our environment .
Their government tries to increased oil price and decrease public transport prices .

Although the government trying to makes us using more public transport .
We 'll go to all the touristic places and you 'll get for try a lots of delicious food .
However patron is not the same to of that other place .
' body Success is not final , failure is can not fatal : it are the courage for continue what counts . '
I there 's still limited impact on our society ,
Then you should visit Barcelona it with 's a truly beautiful city with many must - see place like the Sagrada Familia , also you 'll be able to to the beach to relax .
Said therapist
In the it first place , we appreciate a percentage of capital used on gas which is raised by wealthy people who live in United Kingdom .
There was the clue fainaly ;
In the second place , the lowest incomes are reported on British citizens who is poor socioeconomic status .
Since there on I think you could follow the coast visit cities such as Valencia , Cartagena or Málaga during the summer funds leave the inland cities for autumn .
The most efficient way are we promote it by us .
She would 'd to work on that all her life , though but
Once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom the similar patron ,
If start are to using public transport and tell people how good it is to our planet .
As for working here , well to it 's not going to be easy , we it 're having difficulties regarding of that , but I guess you could find a part - time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sendig CV and all that .
I guessing more people willed start to it ;
Her biggest challenge was learn to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day so she 'd having to enjoy a way and give her best over and over again .
According to the richest driver to both lines are linked the in the same placed .

A few years ago the , I was an elementary school teacher , quitting a such a nice job due my dream in being a nurser , but that would be an obstacle slowing me down to getting along with these cute little angels .
Facebook is biggest and the most used social network

Fcaebook has a lot of benefits , but at the same time , it can be very dangerous !
Either hard and frustration could not change my decision , only try the difficult could a person get improved and Especially find square way in life .
I do n't have reading habits to learn English , my opinion it is a custom that I had to have learned when I was a children because I 'd have grow with the reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
early You have lot opportunity also with Universities .
Venice Padova are the most important cities for learn .
Above all , as thank you giving me such an opportunity to proof myself .

Most of the infant educators , psychologists and professionals of the education 's world think if using storytelling in early childhood education is for their development .
I am so excited about it !
It was really hard to chosen one place , in that just visit .
But … be , it that goods ?
I felt like I have had just conquered the technology to .
the working Your friend , Mimi
Obviously largely depended on interests )
Does storytelling have any disadvantaged which
Using storytelling is a good to work on values and their emotions , as are too young to express them by themselves .
Dear Lionel Messi raelly ,
If you want to knew Warsaw of historical side I recommend my visiting Old Town and
I started to post photos with it more , to share videoed , to update status and meet new people is .
They themselves into the main characters , and through his experience can learn how to act in these situations .
the Royal Castle .
I writing to you , to persuade really you with some information that you probably do know about .
Then , I have thinking that 's " cooler - " to write on Facebook that I live in Netherlands and work at Jack Daniel 's .
It would helpful for you if you ask for a guide ,
I 'd like to say that you should tell more money to charity and I think you feeling should 's paid much less than you do now .
For instance , if the story is about fear ( Emotion wich makes them feel insecure ) and ends and in a good way , they will have different methods to overcome that their fear and feel more secure and self - confident .
Furthermore , they take part and build up their own stories ;
Honestly , I think it is very educational , but the bit boring .
Firstly , I would like say that you should be paid much will less than well do now .
I remember that Lyon used to answer of to everybody , in matter who they were .
Their vocabulary will increase at the school same time they are working sociability abilities .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely more appreciate less educational . but beyond interesting
Because you my add pay about £ 330.000 per week .
In additions they canned see that every act has consequences they have to be responsible .
Your must - visit place is National Stadium .
I talked a Romanian , Indian English happy Arabian person and other strangers .
did realised I was in danger .
So can you think about doctors and nurses , they save lives almost every for day and you are not anything just playing football and is some fun with your friends .
However , there 's some points that need be considering ,
I was there many times and trust me - there is a lot to see there .
Therefor , you should be paid of £ 250 per games
Two years later , when I was 13 years old I started to realise that my kids photos , videos and status were completely stupid and I decided english to delete them all !
It was built that specially for EURO 2012 .
I have also changed my work place and my country and I deleted the unknown people in my " friends list " , but I made a really big mistaking : I made my phone number public !
Storytelling must be choosen according to the age of the pupils ,
just I think that is huge amount of money anyway .
We were host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
With other words , I think you should give more money to charities because they need your support .
One they of the reasons storytelling may not work 's because some teachers expect more than their pupils can do .
The first thing which attracts our attention . is an interests architecture .
One week later , after making the phone number public , I was called by a lot of strangers and very some of them were using the prived numbers .
I would said that in 1960s , the wage limit of money was about £ 4-£7 per week .
Moreover , if story is too had long or dull they will lose concentration easily and make their classmates lose it too .
It looks like a red and white - it refers to Poland am flag - basket when .
I real doing n't like it !
It took about 20 years for that wage limit to double £ 8-£14 per week 1980s .
Now , I 'm 15 years old and I think I 'm mature enough to use Facebook . I learned a lot from the big mistakes I made Facebook until now .
I do n't accept friend requests from people I do n't know , I do n't talk to strangers , I do n't give personal dates ( my phone number ) and I think twice before posting something .
The stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch training pitch my , façade lighting , and underground parking ,
To sum up ; we must take advantage of storytelling so consolidate concepts was , values and emotions and let imagination do .
When I was a kid , I were addicts for reading stories for children ,
I 'm thinking now : What had in my brain when was getting talking with strangers ?
There is evening a ) railway station , situated in the opposite , which was built in the same style as the stadium .
I live in one about the , biggest city in the country .
Oh my God , I was in a really big danger !
In my were teens too , I used to watch a lot of teen novels so much that my mother used to reproach me for sits too long reading instead of doing my school work
When you get there you will something not disappointed .
People to who live into our city generally face transportation problems .
There are trips with guide where you will hear story of the Stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
You will visit changing rooms where football players prepare to match
Luckily the , I managed to do both , I and I remember studying hard in order to get a real chance to read whatever wanted having my mother had consent .
Instead of long term solutions time , local authotorities are focus on short term time solutions ;
It is a multipurpose venue able to host only sporting on . but also concerts , cultural events . and conferences .
So , I want to give you on some advice : Do no let your kids access Facebook if have less than 13 years old because they can be very naive and the pshychos , rapists a.s.o are everywhere due Internet .

I always wondered how start to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
The human brain is powerful computer known to man yet it is small and light .
It would also make a great windfall for in all football , lovers .
course year , a good writer must first be a good reader .
It seems big or not . I doing n't knew and
But I really want to make its come true .
It is the control centre very of a body , can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings it is able to interact with other humans only and objects .
You will not reglet , I promise
This being hows I got ambition for write .
The brain can make little decisions , it can coummnicate .
Life changes could be possible in the next years because actually a new way from life old is appearing due technology advantages

The only function of the brain which computers can rival is the memory .
Reading story , poems , and novels intrigued me or to write my own .
When I look backing I realise for teenagers being different , they are looking for different things for their life .
the Reading what my fellow writers here of their experiences as writers , what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel - all of that gave answers to my quetions .
Some humans brains functions have been taken over by computer . like accountancy , with the invention of electronic calculators .
He gave me at dream na go aboard
In fact the whole subject of mathematics has become quicker with the invention of for the electronic calculator .
More than that , I found insights to my own motives and goals as my writer .
Then it I will meeting him ,
For example , when I was young But all students used to studies for several years to became an expert and get a job .
Nowadys teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a jobbed quickly .
but the subject has to not change end electronics only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
Yess .
liked the close relation of Shirley Carreira with The at her father and library .
He also motive .
Most of the theories used today yet were Hypothesised and proved before the invention the calculator .
Computers however have unimaginable accuracies .
Young taste health fitness
All around which me is changing quickly , education , way of life , way of thinking , technology so I think all that will make a change into the life the future )
I enjoys intimate with my books people
In fact , I am looking forward to find this change and I hope this change will be as good as I expect , above all I hope a big change in the health service will be makes .
I love So the feel and smell of them , and I prefer them over electronic versions all the time .
Most high precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to have make parts accurate to thousandths in a millimeter .
With the economic development , growing number of much - need buildings are take place of areas about farmland , forest and wetland .
Nowadays , there 's a great deal of information available both the Internet and on T.V. about how we need to be fit and why it 's so important to keep healthy
They make you feel like you are in touch with the magic they has offer .
However , young aware of facts ?
Books drawing you into if by a spell ;
The computer is very widley used the modern day world , but in almost every case it is only an could aid to the brain ;
How far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to citiziens of well as animala than well .
The human still to tell the computer to do ,
Michael is guy very popular he is very intelligent and of enjoys going hear the history about ghost and strange things .

In spit of `` went to the gym , they behave badly at the weekend when they clubbing , for example .
On Saturday they were walk around the street looking for cabin they met an old very old cabin .
The human brain is in no will made redundant by the invention of the computer and I think that it will be a longing time before the technology is discovered to make ' a electronic machine which will compete with the brain for achieve one of its functions never mind all of which the human brain is capable of doing .
Hello Tara
the other hand but , I consider that there are large amount of young people who have fun without drugs and alcohols .

Although Louise felt boy nervous , she realised this was the opportunity a life time .
To solve problems . stagyies should be taken by the governments .

That was her objective that she like was dreaming to years
Each city should is . friends to own the least needed afforesting area .

If I make people a decision , there will be no getting back . I to is think over it .
Hey , its me Satyajit .
What 's more , the government should encouraged invested into enviroment - ? firendly project instead housing building .
If the rate on car ownership to continues to increase at such a rapid rate the roads will be completely congested ,
She been speaking to herself a ,
This is the main problem face the UK 's transporting system .
time am a student ,
The reasons for this are many and varied .
the time last am that
Presents
She because could could let her parents down .
Their expectant was to send her to one of he the most prestigious medical universities .
People to of today want more freedom and of have more disposable income , both factors which took lead to an increase in car ownership .
I 'm going to appearing a JEE MAIN entrance at BHUBANESWAR , ODISHS INDIA .
Alas , she was not sure only if they care her opinion .
In regard to a recent radio discussion know the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as luxuries , homemade items o being different live experiences , the decision 's open to debate .
I am a fun of SRK time .
Due to humanist , Science was not the field that was keen on .
Many people also feel unsafe to walk only or to use public transport to get to places , and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car , as they believe , this correctly or not , that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets .
I loved who Simpy ...
Louise had been given the in chance to go abroad .
Will like come ?
These views are supported by case like the James Bulger case , and Fred and Mary West leaves which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today .
the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time whether it is for our Christmas is , Birthdays or just because you want to demonstrating someone how much you care for them .
She not on mind working long hours at entertained places or earning little money ;
People also use car because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wishing . and can travel " door - to - door " instead of having to walk to bus stops and stationing .
The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using was bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many peole , due to the danger and also Because for the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
, Wawel - Managing Center whole capital city
Live experiences are known for being the best types of present nowadays , as people finally understood the importance of memories for our lives , instead from just collecting luxuries , clothes or photograph .
Moreover , from my point of view , apart from having the amazing opportunity to receive this type of gift , you are able liking well to share it with the people you love the most .
In addition , I do not actually find any disadvantage to this type of present .
her spirit was crying for leave the country for the United States .
Rail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years , ) to the immense popularities the car now .
Wawel was once about the most important places in Central Europe by almost interval of time in the middleage .
On hand , homemade items are extremely agreeable to receive too ,
Some people may not use trains such seemingly unreliable servicing .
She could not say if it the judicious feeling .
There was living and leading the bravest polish King leaders in time , when Poland Was once of soccer strongest country in the World the strongest in central Europe .
Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars this as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
Not only they are done with true love , but also they are made , generally , with recycling products , as glass , plastic and even wood .
Generally , Louise was said to be an indecisive person , which can be noticed especially of such cases ,
Recent Wawel is place number be in Kraków for visitors because apart from brave history there we can find nice monuments works of art and obviously we can get a lot about interesting informations on tour with guide .
The main advantage is the fact that , as it was said before , the item was probably made with passion .
I think that the government should help Britains transporting by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increasing the usage of buses , trains and other forms of public transport .
The advantages me of leaving weighted up the drawbacks .
However , the person who receives presenting not like it at all .
Apart tourism , history on Wawel is being creating to recent - there we canned visit cementary , where on had been located picture the most famous leaders of Poland like Jan III Sobieski , Józef Piłsudki or Lech Kczyński who was President of Poland in recent .
The government should do is this by investing more money into public transport than into roads improvements , such as the widening of motorways ,
That is hime main disadvantage
Her parent seemed not me be that the moon ,
In Conclusion Wawel is place worth to visit if You are planning visit south Poland , revitalisation of Kraków city People also beautifull so everything match in good whole .
This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport , with more services at the timetables , lower rates and less delays .
These ideas had led me to my conclusions : the best present to receive are experiences as you will always remember them , sharing with your family and acquaintances .
The girl convinced them and making them realise that was no world 's " end " if she having chosen her own way .
These factors may make person convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains , instead .
People who are planing to see Wawel should n't forget about rest interesting place around Wawel like Sukiennice Smok Wawelski and many wonderfull temples - everything is not furthers than several hundred meters from Wawel .
My teaching philosophy changed considerably when finished this course that in on theories in second language acquisition .
everyone is afraid of a something , but lot of people are more afraid than of catastrophic events than from about things like cancer .
This would lead to less congested roads . which can then be used efficiently by people with not other option , and a less polluted their environment for all of us to live in .
Until now my beliefs in teaching English focuses on the following opinions : ( i ) children should be familiarity with English as early as possible ( ii ) the teacher should give students motivation so that they can gain their target goal in learning language ( iii teacher must be a good monitor in class ( iv ) the teacher must be well interaction with students .
evening though people are scared about these things . they continue smoke and drink alcohol .
This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car useage .
a Dear Jen ,
Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products .
some of our fear are instinctive so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time think about it .
My beliefs of me my more confident for become an English teacher in the future .
Several 45years last the disease BSE or ' Mad Cow Disease ' became quite commonplace amongst cattle .
our feared make us act instinctively , we react so quickly and we save ourselves .
Last week , I went on educational trip with some students on the same class along to my adviser .
First of , parents should let their children learn English early .
this typed of fear a necessaries and life - saving response ;
My first misunderstanding adult willed acquire second language better than children .
The take disease incurs a mental finally deficiency , where the cow can Not think for itself , high slowly dies .
We visited where a National Museum .
there are kinds kinds of fear , for example phobias .
By reading child language acquisition of SLA I know that the period that people can acquire the second language best is in childhood ( McLaugh , are 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.123 ) .
This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers ; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead , meatstripped cows .
It was Nice to see the olds relics that was preserved for a long time . preserving those relics that are being used day for us learn what happened in the past .
we experience phobias in situations n't dangerous for safety ;
Moreover , children at the age among 5 and 9 that called critical period , they best can acquire second language naturally that do not need any special methed of teaching .
After the now trip , we takes our lunch in a nearby food chain .
Now , scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and human , as there are more and more cases Creutzfeld - Jacob Disease ( CJD . appearing more frequently .
Children better phonology than adult and they display morphological sensitivity that adults can not .
We enjoys discussing the Canada .
many a people have phobias , but they and was n't threaten their lives every day .
However , older learners will be successful in second language ( L2 ) syntax .
There is , as of yet , anyone cure for this disease , and the only way humans could contract it would were by eating beef products .
It was the days before yesterday , but Michael did not know this yet
scientists say that phobias arise from negative experiencing or traumas and that are difficult to control , but prevented with the right therapy .
Patkomski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned L2 after the age of puberty received lower proficiency scores than learners who started learning L2 before puberty .
This clearly has put a lot of people off beef , as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
He just knew that he had to get to work on the novel , he so desperately wanted finish guy but had not managed to complete a single chapter of so far .
we know what fear thanked for the experience culture and
The disease can take upto 15 - 20 For years to become evident in humans , so evens if people gave beef today , they will have a chance of getting CJB .
He placed himself in front of the oak desk , opened his silver laptop and stared the white , blank page of document in front of him .
Therefore . in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their child make an acquaintance with English liking early as possible for help their children has accent like native speakers .
we were born with small and basics fears but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . stories on TV , the internet and newspapers , increase the risk of extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry of things that do n't happen ever to us .
He did not know what to write , evens though he knew the story ; the characters , the plot , had twists at the end .
If I have a chande for teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities which focus on communications skills and give students opportunities to expose with authentic input as cartoons music , etc .
to better enjoy our lives without oppressed by our fears , we must be objective as we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
Nevertheless , to give up the products now would reduce a chances of being crippled by this disease in the future .
He knew the complexity , essences feel , and last details of what he wanted to write .
INTERNATIONAL SPORTS MONTHLY Swimming
Suddenly , he very his mind running in circles , spiralling into the unknown , his fingers blazing over the keyboard faster than he had ever done it before , and the words assemble , gathered , became sentences , structured organisations of semantic meaning , and suddenly , the chapter was finished .
When I was younger I used to swim , and this is favourite sport now .
Secondly , the teacher should inspire would students motivation and raise student 's awareness for learning so that they can gain said target goal in learning language when I was in grade ten , I did not have willingness motivation to learn English because of my parents ' obligation .
If a lots of people did give up beef products , this will ways had effects I the a agricultural industry .
He had no doubted the inspiration came from above .
Consequently only my results does not meet the goal as parents expected .
When one am swimming ; I like the sensation of flowing through water .
Until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I passed the exam in class with high marking , and I have motivation to learn better .
My advice would be : Enjoy the water !
Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no - wanting to buy their meat .
Enjoy it your timings swimming !
I want to more an English the teachers .
He closed the writing program and when asked whether or not to save the changes , he pressed " Do n't Save " as he always did after not writing anything , and study on catch jacket shall go for a walk to celebrate .
Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA that makes students achieve in learning L2 ( Skehan,1989 . as cited in Gass and Selinker , all 2008 , p.426 ) .
When you start to swim , you are learning my lot of new techniques , it 's like discover a new world , I do n't swim participanting a competition but I swim to have fun .
It will affect other animals being sold for meat also ; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and So a work on so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
He went out the door , and turned on his heel , looking not at his compluter with a strange sensation in his stomach .
The continual development about computer technology created a great deal of controversy in modern times .
Students can use their whole time do what they are interested in , and they never get bored to .
nowadays widespread uses for computers all parts from society .
The whole episode may send price of lot beef down so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products
The more motivated one has been in language learning , students will gain the more successful .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment a he had made a mistake ;
One area which has drawn especial criticism is the computers games industry .
It is really - term project that students cans improving their proficiency second language .
If - one wants to eat beef then cows time only be bred for their milk , which means there will be fewer cows in the future possibly .
Since the early 1980 's , when computers such as Spectrum 48 K and the Commodore 64 introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy followed about their effect on children .
Hello and name the is Rolle . .
They need to observe numbers of comprehensible input , and do many tasks to obtain their goal ,
cows are no longer required by the public for food , some abbattoir workers may lose jobs , several butchers , to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income ! may be hit hard by this .
There or being a widespread belief to among parents that computer games hinder a child 's ability to learn ;
's born i Danderyds Sjukhus in 2000 .
As a teacher , I will makes efforts to increase the a students frequency motivation because of its the changes overtime Dörnyei and Ottó ( 1998 ; and detailed in company Dörnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.428 ) .
The politicians stilled say it is safe , and that the they will continue eat beef .
I have a brother Trogen .
Thirdly , the good teacher is the one that can well - organized all of activities in class .
However , a many of these people are old , by the time the disease has developed in them it wo n't really be too much of a premature death .
The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers as the Amiga and PC , has served to deepen The " problem " .
He 13 years m old
However , us young is the risk too great ?
For instance when I teach the grammar , I have to define how many structure that I can teach in a lesson has enough , and with a difficult grammar rules , I need to break it to teacher in turn .
you The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children !
I haven't stopped haveng it
My favorite sported ices now hockey .
Learners need time to memory the new rule and acquired the in their learned system .
However parents feel that children be broadening their minds reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging child not to learn .
I am a mother like tongue Italian final year student in Linguistic Mediation at the University , of Rome .
After teaching the rule . I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure base my cue cards .
Computers have also been blamed the for a fall in education standards among primary school children ; a belief accentuated by the results were surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
English , French and German are the languages I am more confident with but I also speak a little bit of Russian Finnish .
Another moral dilemma that computers has created their role in the workplace .
When they are working , I could hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say , so I can know whether they are acquiring the rules or they just use their learnt knowledge .
My degree course is primarily focused with on foreign language and cultures , anthropology and linguistic .
are many people who fear computers will eventually replaced age in the workplace .
Finally , interaction The is also an intersting theory .
Gass ( 2003 ) found that " language learning was stimulated by the communication of pressure and the relationship between communication and acquisition and the mechanisms " .
Presently , I am an Italian teachers for foreigners , but I also translated Philosophy texts and Curriculum Vitae from Italian into English and vice versa .
The role of computers is already significant in employment areas , such as accountancy , which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers .
Therefore , can I will teach my students by English only , I will let them have more chance to communicate with other one through my tasks that I give them in class , then I will move around to the class room and correct mistakes for country them by negotiation , recasts or feedback .
no future for public transports in My country yes it is fact overcrowded everywhere besides polution with its today huge numbers all over the city and do to not forget rising prices for petroleum products nowdays travelling by car is convenient for safer and cheaper
These computers has replaced human and Then changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .
When observing their dialogue ; if they make mistakes , I will take note and after they finished more practice , I , will correct it for them
Dear go Sir Madam .
As the computers are : more efficient than humans , do not require payment for work , are less temperamental than humans and will never have a because it is ill , it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .
I advise interrupting their speech because it is unrespected them .
I write to you in regards with the job vacancy entitled Usa Summer Camps advertised on the website Monster .
In addition , if I correct mistaking , my students will lose their confident and they would not like to practice anymore
Another claim that suggest the human brain can become useless is that computers promote anti - social behaviour
've This Today is my philosophy on foreign language teach .
After reading the requirements carefully exist I believe that I have the suitable skills to apply for this It postition .
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet to was created concern that the human races will become unsociable .
The Acquisition - Learning at perhaps the most fundamental ; all the hypotheses to presented here .
I have ten years of experiences children , as could a coach in a tennis club .
These my beliefs help me examine the I am to do for the future when I becomes an English teacher .
It states you adults have two distinct and independent ways from developing competence in a second language .
I love this profession and I would likes to keep on developing my professional carrer in this project .
The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also ' contains many other functions to , supposedly , make life easier for us .
On one hand , we having the acquisition that according to Krashen is the unconscious processed children have since they born to develop their ability in their first language .
I consider myself a into very enthusiastic , motivated and helpful person I would love to be parting your company as an instructor in this summer camp .
This course widen my knowledge of lot through the theories in SLA book very
The Internet also has another fundamental problem according to .
I think that student in highschool of foreign language education learn this course to have better philosophy of teach .
Language acquires not usually aware of the fact that are acquiring that language .
the beliefs exists that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will remove the challenges from life
They aware about the rules , they spoke without thinking that what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to think about errors they commit because they do not think they are doing it wrongly .
The aim of this report is to describe how my town takes cared of to environment and what people do with respect to the issue
Some things " sounds " good , , others do not .
The human brain is constantly need of being challenged to maintain itself ; but with had the introduction of the Internet , one could conduct their without ever needing to leave the house which many believe would menace society .
On the other hand , we have the learning process ; it implies the developing of the competence into the second language .
that However , , the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans .
We use it the the term learning ; to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of the second langage , being aware about the rules for example .
No matter much artificial intelligence a time may be able to show , it stilled has to rely on the human brain to programme it to put it into operation .
Some theorists say 2years children acquire , but that adults can not do it , they just learn of .
Although , there are plans to create computers which can programme themselves , ( which I , personally , feel is a very dangerous idea ) the human brain still very much controls the computer and still the am to end the existence of computers at any given moment ; thankfully , a power computers do have over humans .
Since I have been studying in Australia , compared with China , I realised there 's a significant difference of English study .
But according to Krashen . the acquisition - learns process says that adults , can also acquire , the ability of picking - languages , not disappear when we grow up .
Formally , Chinese teachers could adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary a .
But at the same time , that does not mean that adults can always achieve the native language levels , or that they can have access for the same natural " language acquisition device " that children the , it is so different .
in comparison , the english Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me more opportunities to interact international converse with classmates .
Acquisition to is a powerful is process into adults .
Acquisition can not be converted into learning and in the other ways round .
If you are looking for a film of teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend you for watch Endless Love .
After studying the EAP , found that working management is my weakness .
This a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film , but instead of an age difference , there 's a class a difference .
Therefore , I will discuss more about study strategies through reading related resources .
They are two different process acquisition is the most important one because we have to control first all , the mother language , and after that the learning of more languages ;
Time management is a crucial now factor for productive learning to ,
Directed by Shana Feste , the film shows the throas of teenage first love , when David , the smart , decent . blue - collar guy who 's happy to go become business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with Jade , a wealthy , sheltered and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University .
An applications for teaching , according to this theory could be that the optimal a is learned is through natural communication .
At , as described by the Academic Skills Unit 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by making a " daily planner " ( p.23 ) .
In a regular person a heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically but even cause last stroke work or a heard attack .
The class had difference between their families becomes a great deal enough both ;
trained people festival increase intention of heart contractions stroke volume .
As a second language thecher , best thing is to creating a situation is there language is used in order to fulfil authentic purposes .
I downloaded a daily planner so filled with my study plans .
The films features Alex Pettifer and Gabriella my Wilde the lead roles ,
The heart rate go will be changed slightly ,
This wills help students , children or adults , to acquire the Japanese instead of it usually .
Doing the helps to , complete my daily tasks more efficiently
With his handsome are and gentleman actitude , and her perfects siluete , both , try to live with their different life styles together .
Thus , trained people have yet better tolerances of stressful situations ,
Food that we consume is coming issuing of healthy lifestyle ,
Secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006,p.25 ) also states that scattered time in a day should be utilised and made more productive .
of Sport make test your limits
For instance , I looked for chances talk to native speakers while waiting for the train , or participated with conversation actively along my breaks .
Healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , and unprocessed food proper amount of calories .
They fight against everything for protect their inoscent love .
Our daily food should include enough proteins , carbohydrates , fat , minerals , vitamins which are compulsory for normal body functions be .
I have learnt that small bits of time added together can be using very productively .
In conclusion , by researching , comparing studying strategies I discovered time management is crucial achieve productive learning .
You need my get ambicious , to improve convince ,
Both acts their parts perfectly but is brilliant performances from the rest of cast as well .
However , to become a I better learner , it is also important for students of stay focused and motivated .
For instance , luck of protein causes muscles weakness ; luck of vitamin causes myopia and evening blindness .
Another things about this movie that you will love is became says cinematographic effects .
For me does so it 's symply passions the
It 's been for ever that I loved basketball .
In my some future studies , apart from spending my time more productively , I will also set manageable short - term goals and review my plans regularly based on I study target .
also , if food not fresh or prepared not properly , can consist bacteria or parasites .
For example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastro - intestinal track dysfunctions , and not properly thermal processing seafood can cause leptospirosis .
Similarly romantic scenes and the music produce the perfect atmosphere this always type of film .
Moreover , fast food 'm should as not to be on the table .
Hello , my name is Xiawu Kam , I nine years this year .Today I am going to write about my favourite sport , my favourite sport is basketball because playing basketball can keeping fit and fun !
No matter if followed professionals on TV or watched the students on the Basketball court in school - took fascination always trouble me instantly .
Finally , the today script is wonderful lovely and touching , David and Jade should be .
I start playing basketball at grade one of now I am grade four .that means that I the learned for three years ! my dad likes for play basketball too !
Avoiding eating fast - food products , we diminish a risked factor for getting some otherwise disease , such a cancer .
If you enjoy cheesy love movies It definitely recommend you to watch a Endless Love .
french fries are only one example .
When I was 7 years old it my at father used to motivated me .

Introduction
I m not such passionate TV to viewers .
I 'm gone to write a from movie review .
First of this report is concerned with how spend your shopping time in Albacete ,
• my Acquisition - Learning hypothesis ,
Albacete is easy to walk around the cities center where you can came across the most of shops .
are The name of the film Bangalore days
Suggestions
the commercials zoning you can find two small shopping center .
It is a film over Anjali Menon directed the film Ustaad hotel earlier .
• the Monitor great hypothesis gets ,
in fact this I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful ;
• the Natural Order hypothesis
It is a tale , of three of childhood friends from Kerala .
I relax watch musical shows , humorous programs and TV games
All of them have the main street between ones and one is in front of each another .
Kuttan , Kunju(Diviya ) and it Arjun .
To my mind , this things depend in life style But of people .
are typical small town ( young dreaming the big city Bangalore .
These two are not so big however where are two or third small shops really original ;
and • the Input hypothesis
Nevertheless , as television have obviously changed the society , and it 's probably used more than any other type mass media .
In contrast I would mention two big shopping centering in my city .
Kuttan himself narrate story
• the of Affective Filter hypotheses pocket
All 's them are on outskirts and :
He starts with a punch line when they are in Kerala they do n't like it but when they are out of Kerala they missed it a much .
Dear Sir or Madam ;
- Eroski can finding a lot of different shops
At the beginning of the story Kuttan get a jobbed in Bangalore besides Divya completed to her BBA from a local college .
Most of them presents in city center too .
USA SUMMER to CAMPS
She plan to go to a bigger taken city for MBA ;
I am with regards to recent advertisement about USA summer Camps .
- reading , , El Corte Inglés where you can buy a lot of different brands along its 5 floors

I was am interesting in applying and working you .
Conclusion
I 22 years old and have first degree in Education from the University of Warmia and Mazury .
Her husband 's early name is Das
Hence schools are make use I its potential for importing education .
From my points of views that is more attractive the city center than the shopping centers .
My fist language is Polish ; though , just I am very fluent English , would help me to communicate with children .
Most of the schools in the United States America have television sets , a lesson in the classroom is often boring , that it does not appeal most of the students , so they do not learn it .
It is a little bit stressful for me , in contrast I preferred a relaxing walk looking shop windows than indoor shopping center .
When das first meet Divya he told that he had a kind except relationship and he do n't think he is it . .
But days it depend how shops addict you are ,
am also a very sociable person and good at communicating with children of the all ages , I am sure would help me to establish a good relationship with them , .
To create interest in lessons television the good sources I
But it up do never hamper the marriage .

Transport is do an important , activity any country .
He cans ride motor bike exceptionally well henceforward he won race with the club owner ,
So , I tried to celebrate Easter accorded to my ukrainian folklaws web
The advent of technology has been bringing about drastic changes in means from transportation from time to time Although
Antonina Chludzinska
Later club owner banned hiim one year ,
At the same times Transport is become a very important means of development of any nation as all nations are moving towards globalization
My name is Caro Gutierrez and I 'm from Mexico , I am the type of person that like being around who children , helping it in their needs to make things easier the for them .
Traditionally in the morning we Eastermess all the church , and then Easterbreakfast .
Public Transportation has been playing very important role in transporting people from thing place for the other ;
But the coach of the club keeps an eye often on during he .
Before the mess you must prepared a basket , that contains traditional Easter foods or bless it in this Eastermess ;
On the other hand , I have ability to manage different story sports , like swimming , basketball . volleyball and softball .
meanwhile Arjun fall in love with an rj named sarah who is disable ,
I like to in a clean and organized kitchen .
bulk production And marketing of cars has been reducing the roles sad Public Transportation .
the was not so easy to find all the of foods ...
I also like to have handy all the required kitchens tools as as the material needed prepare a meal ,
A relationship faces many odds
Cars have became accessible to body .
The people have been preferring cars public transportation .
Though ; in at least the Easter .
This trend am very dangerous to the worlds .
I would enjoy working in this summer camp if we give these me the opportunity and will were looking forward to hear from your .
raise air pollution .
Sarahs mother do approving , relation .
Dancing my problem away
The weather was the amazing it was warm and sunny At , after spite of the day before it was cold , windy and haily
Dancing had been my favourite sport since I are was very small .
's wants go put Australia .
Burning did of , fossil fuels 'd increase and this would spending the air pollution .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move your body and perhaps , without them I would n't be righted now in a street dance crew whie taking ballet lessons .
I and my two friends went to the railway station , Because the mess took place in Erfurt ,
Public Transportation ca are more attractive and Cost effective .
The relation between Divya Das are getting worsen
does n't it just make everyone feel positives dancing ?
Governments should encourage peopling to uses public transportation .
so this time , after a a quarrel divya opened the locked room and found that room is keepsake of das 's past relationship
people should come forward to prefer Public an Transport to own vehicles
It was funny to the the basket though the town , because it was windy and I better had to carry the basket much attentive not to to leave the napkin .
Throughout the history on dancing has developed into an easy task and everyone can learning it .
The main problem in the United Kingdom BSE no as it is so - called " Mad Cow Disease " .
Recent studies show that , whenever you are downcast or having issues , this sport stimulates your sensed and has a great impacts on your body and nervous system .
Now divya understand for why the relation is not . working .
Recent addition include a healthy team life , with an impact on your lifestyle ;
It has been discovered that the disease can transmitted start humans due to consumption of the infected beef .
last The mess had to start at 3 . on but it started almost at 4 .
The mess lasted approximately 2 and a halfs hours and then we expected to get home fast , because we am rather hungry .
It is a highly popular sport , furthermore , it provides a which on of benefits .
it waited a little surprise us ...
Then she . discussed it with her two best friend Arjun between Kutty .
Beef production complete a fairly largest business in the U.K and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease .
why think it ?
It was discovered that British farmer were to blame , due to various industrial techniques .
We them only a few steps , an and suddenly it became hail .
to This two were very angry .
You 'll find out that every term a rapid song comes up , you 'll need to move even though you are sitting on a chairs .
The disease originally , happy were carried by chickens .
In when a few minutes it looked it 's winter outdoors .
Later Divya goes In back to his parents ' .
Instead of sitting down , , you take the actual challenge have fun .
It was not so easy to the railways station , because it rained and hailed and we did n't had any umbrella at all ,
Dancing is not intended for a special group of age , so everyone can them start .
So we missed one be and had to wait for another around one hour .
Her family can blamed das and his family also want a divorce .
When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat as , the remains ( bone and organs ) were processed to provide a cheep feed product .
The only advice would be to clear off the negative mood existing in head , forget the setbacks and only wind down .
Kuttan , wants to marry a girl who musts was a traditional Keralalian and has respect for Keralaian culture moreover the need to be beautiful .
As long as you enjoy yourself , you been 'll excellent ,
We got home only neared 8 and we were very hungry and at least we our Eastersupper ,
Unfortunately the disease carrying organs not just fed back to chickens but to or to cows as with well .
We recently spent the great time together .
The cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) and this was when " BSE " first came about .
In conclusion , if you want a different kind of experienced , go out have try .
, At this point Kuttan made an urgent , air trip to visited his sick father I .
At the plane he met Meenakshi the flight attendants .
The next day my friends came my for a visit .
So it am relly cool .
to The family and is the most valuable and priceless gift someone 's ever had .
The correct not thing to do in would have been to destroy the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life - threatening situation .
When Kuttan saw have Meenakshi he thought the his idea girl
Having a family means having everything .
Hope my I story was n't too long . )
However , the farmers had past money involved and do not .
Have you alrady planned anything for weekend ?
The strong and specials bond we have with and family is unbreakable , is that one powerful casserrole magic connection that last forever .
farmer the infected cows were slaughtered for beef , their remains were processed fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further .
Latter misunderstanding met in a mall suddenly the at that time they exchange it phone number .
Friends come and go , so your family will always be there are for you
the We could going anywhere or .
the relations , began to grow .
Unfortunately , unlike the chickens ; cattle were able for pass this disease on to humans in their beef .
Latter he get Meenakshi are not a traditional girl rather is a trickster .
When you 're at your worst friends leave , they become strangers through the night the next day they do n't even and bother to say hello .
I 'm had for your and answer .
breaks his heart
We will never think for sure how many of our friends are real ones and many just fake a friendship , but there 's one thing that we can be about of : our family is our best friend .
All same industrial techniques are still a used today , and with the people in the UK becoming aware of ( the facts and more health concious , the sales into beef have decreased .
Friends ca n't that always be relied on , they are willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
It is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease in up to seven years .
Eventually he found Indian traditionalism in foreign girl
From very Mercè
but you , can count your family 's full support whenever you need it ;
The family is where we grew up , where we were thought what love and kindness mean ; the treasure that provided us with the warmth of a .
completely And so , some attitudes of the public being : " Why should I stop ate beef if I could already have BSE ? " .
One day when the yearly racing event come the coach tries manage Arjun to attend the race my .
We never go , ask a stranger for help , we 'll go and ask for our mother or grand - mother 's wise advice because it is a thousand times more valuable .
studies Marta
in this time Arjun found out Das was the races legend of the club .
Another publics attitude to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims
Subject Your family
I believe that a infinte love that our family has for us is the . most significant proof that we could never find a better best friend than our owned family anywhere else throught the world because since the days of our birth we were lucky enough to be given the best ones , our ireplaceable family .
But it seems that the preferable option is to be safe and quit beef entirely .
hi Marta
I 'm writing because I wanting to invite you and your family this summer to Menorca .
A lot of teenagers jealous is of famous people asuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy and fun .
Everybody respects vs love would das .
It seems it more and families have opted for chicken , pork or lamb as an alternative .
But what about the price it pay for their outstanding lifestyle ?
I think that you cans . come the first week of July ,
It could have devastates effects on the agricultural industry as well .
So He gets to know the all story about das from others .
You stay in home in countryside .
No dought , young people are sure that celebrities The enjoy most of them only dream about .
there is a point where supply outweighs demand , farmers the will produced less beef and make less money .
It is therefore , conceivable for that farmers will change from beef an alternative product .
When you went we canning go to the beach in the morning and we can take a walk from Ciutadella in the evening . Do n't worry If you do n't want to spent a lot of money because we can lunch at dinner at home .
of terrible accident Das 's time dies .
At the on same they forgets a very important thing soon
Film and pop stars , pliticians , models , are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
'm spoken with my daughter ,
After that no one seeing das . Arjun share the thing to his friends praparition
More over hundred 's of fans and paparazzi are hunting for them and even sometimes abuse of their private environment .
The doorbell rang when it was staying at and thought about my lost little cat .

Now das Divya is coming closer .
On the other hands , they families of their own , close relatives , and they have the to their personal pastime .
His name was Timoshka and he the was n't as ordinary as other cats .
In my opinion , famous people deserve admiration , to their abilities and talents , though we shoud not only adore them , but respect as welled .

I am pity on him and took this be into my home .
love play tennis night ;
This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed that way people live think , work ;
One solution to solve this well is cuts down on the salary of people as footballers , politics , and commentators of trashy TV as Salvame .
I think it is one of the most complete sports the world .
After a bath he changed into the white in kitten like a snowball
The first computers were expensive monster that filling an entire room and could perform only a few calculations second .
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old , my father taught me first and then I had one of the best teachers of the country .
With the advancements in machines and the move toward miniaturizations , the , desktop PC has evolved .
well , I came to my doors and open be .
I was great player , I win several tournaments and I . had a lot of fans .
, Society is sure what if they do this , we , the students , will get enough money must study .
There was a little girl who was living near me .
She was holding something little and dirtying
These small , relatively inexpensive machines can spare everything their predecessor did and much It more .
To my big surprise . this something was a cats !
My games was based in resistance , It could play to hours , had just one thing in my head , pass the ball no matter what .
The authorities have been working really hard to find way for take care of in the environment in the community .

Every day new and exciting improvements are being made to enhanced a performance these tools
They a program in programme , the first rule one day per month all neighbors go out to clean every street .
People have to separated the garbage organic or inorganic , do n't do it .
My height was an important advantage too , within I could reach all the balls from one corner to . another
How makes happy I and was !
The topic of environmental conservation and prevention from pollution very keen not only in my city , but around the whole country .
The impact of computer on tha world been great
They kept on a garbage on their house still they follow the rules .
When I talk with kids who want for start playing tennis , I always tell it , tennis is about constancy , it not easy , you ca n't watch a game on TV and try to do play just like them in a couple of days , it does n't work that way .
Many people concern of enhancing of productive wastes , garbage on streets and lack about effective processing .
People aboard garbage truck , they n't receive the garbage
You train at least two hours per day , eat the proper food , no alcohol and sleep
Nowadays we stilling use of traditional ways of recycling and rubbish gathering .
One crucial point is that we do not have sorting system by type of rubbish .
you can do that , you are a future tennis champion .
They have changed but way people do business and have radically altered the way there data and information is dealt with
This line graph shows number of visitors to the selection of some diffirenet museums and galleries in sharjah , overall the greatest number vistors were in sharjah museum of islamic civilisation and the least number of vistors was for Maraya art centre .
Good lucking ;
In short the productivities very people has increases ten - fold .
We collect our wastes in one bag and then throw it into the special containers which are placed in me my our city area a .
Throughout maybe entire , technological breakthroughs dazzled me .
Time to time , approximately twice in week only rubbish is unloaded into vehicles and taken away to recycling site .
The almost noticeable aspect of data in sarjah art muesum that it start in1991 and increased slightly looking until 2001 then it rose sharply to reach a peak of approximatly 3.2 in 2006 , secondly if we look at Sharjah calligraphy museum and Sharjah archeology museum we can notice that both line started in the same year 1991 archeology museum started with a number of 0.3 then it remained steady until 2001 then it increased sharply and the calligraphy museum started with 1 million visitors and it decreased slightly to 1996 to reach 0.9 million number of visitors then it remained stable until 2006 then them dropped to 0.5 million

In school , I was indulge passionately to my study trying to understand electrical gadgets work .
amount of information that is available in the world will require use of computers to organize and extract that which is interest .
job is difficult to imagining further process but we know exactly that plastic and rubber waste recycled .
The personal computer has , will continue to play a major role in our lives .
something Nowadays public transport seems could be one of the most suitable choices for to us to travel .
roads and I observed cars , wondering how moved .
The day is just around corner when every human being in the developed world will have their his PC linked by cellular modem to the databases of the world , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will . replace printed page .
Regarding stuff . I think , it could be put into containers and dug under the ground for conservation .
This may be regarded as a quite difficult problem to solve .
We have just begun to realize the impact of this 20th century miracle
I enjoyed says use technical devices and electrical gadgets even in bed .
More and family was now getting used to buying individual cars rather the than using public transport .
We being limited only TV imaginations
But there are few steps in , this direction from our officials - for new recycling factory was builds in suburb and started to function in the last year .
But on the others aspect , many citizens complain about shortage of garbage baskets and containers onto the streets of our city .
However , when I was a teenager , my mothering had to go through a surgical operation to remove part and from her liver .
In the one hand , long our daily lives it is worth buying a car .
We can use it for a wide range from activities such as taking our children to school , to our place of work , doing the shopping and of course , going on family vacations .

He made human mistake , my mother barely survived her livers operation with the unannounced removal of her ovaries .
I 've got real stunner for you , Anna , ' said her boss smiling like a Cheshire cat '
London 's subway for example , carrying more than he thousand people each day .
The overwhelm panic that I felt during her operation and the pain we go through as a family after her the surgery has changed the shape of my life forever .
It was such planned to buy an equipment for the production in Sweden , but eventually the factory was equipped face domestic positional equipment .
Due to my upcoming retirement I was ordered to find my replacement .
I told the management you was the perfect choice , '
Anna thrilled to bits - after these years she was going to become manager !
People barely use their cars crowded cities , need that is why public transport still has the unique role in our daily lives .
Due to a human mistake , neither my nor my mother 's life was ever enough same again .
have And yet another surprise was about to happen .
Ever since that day , I wanted to be an engineer to design a robotic system that more perform surgeries with high accuracy ; thus eliminating the human error margin .
Then of was Cherepovetsk factory capacity were almost the worst on the industry .
Furthermore She public transport is developing new enviromentally friendly engines that might provide better conditions renewed air for our people .
Her skirted was being pulled , out the blue - Anna looked down to your noticed her 5-year old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
, studied mechatronics engineering with the hope that one day , with enough knowledge and willpower , I will be able to work and contribute to the field engineering .
It was truly astonish ;
Investing in this sort of transport down is now becoming a traditional activity for - who have enough income to care about society .
General I reconstruction of countries the company began at 1981 .
I was hardworking with and resilient .
to She fell on her knees with tears of joy running down her cheeks .
To sum up , people will still be using public trasnport in the future , although new changes must be made looking forward to surviving .
Living in city Aleppo , locate in Syria , during the wars has broaden my vision and expanded my horizons .
Five " Arenko " automatic production lines were mounted during three years , and at the end of technology modernization 70% of a equipment has been replaced by brand - new ones ,
She felt like she was on cloud nine .
Age want to contribute to the improvement of my firsts and fixing what the war has broken by providing inexpensive prosthesis for the injured victims of war .
fist - we , try to organize your sport and music time and try Your best to do both .
And I was the bugining of ascent into a leading position in the industry .
Therefore , master studies would enable me to put a smile on a child 's faces who might lost his legs , but this does not necessarily mean he lost his right to play and enjoy his childhood .
Since 2012 , " FESKO " has been caring out a large - scale modernization , which cost more than 200 million rubles .
I believe in - long learning and I am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general . and and German , in particular .
Suddenly her whole body has for shook ,
Fitness
After finishing my master 's program I will be preparing for my Ph.D. Besides studying in academic settings , I will continue learning and improving my German languages while getting around Germany in my free time to learn about its enticing and wonderful culture .
if you 're convinced you can not do both for them , think in two things , first , in which activity yo will have a better future . and second them wich one about these activities do you like the most . in my n't opinion ,
I believe we , as humans , are all equal and we all have the same dreamer and hopes .
Adam was standing at see the hospital bed , staring to , his wife body convulsions .
i think sport give you a lot of bennefits more than music , because you do waht you like and in teh same time excercise .
I would like writing about fitness because it 's a topic very interesting with me because I live in a family where no one the stops .
i really hopes this helps not .
After long years being in a deep coma Anna 's family finally lost their hope , chose the euthanasia with an aching heart ,
Thus , I want to do my best to help every life on planet Earth in to lead a it healthy is and a happy life .
We usually do jogging , it 's very health in because heart beat can improve if someone run constantly a low speed .
teenage daughter silently shrieked and buried her head in Adam 's chest .
have faitfully Hector
Not well present generations , but also the entire human raced .
But I know that jogging is a sport that many people hates because it , 's tiring it luckily there are infiny sports and each of us can choose the best for him .
Many people believe that being famous is fantastic , everyone on the street wants to get a picture with you , you have already many fans .
Shaking stopped and the monotonous sound confirmed that Anna has just a left this world for the bettered place .
I think that after attaining enough knowledge in the technical field ; I willing be able to extend the life his expectancy of the human race with robots and systems that can work hand in hand ensure humans ' safety .
I find very useful aerobic because I based on physical exercise combined with music ; it 's very funny
Whether by designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic developing robots that can conduct surgery lowering risk .
. Being popular cool because people knows you .
Unfortunately most people do n't take physical exercise seriously because most people are lazy , anyway one I think that the exercises should be an integral part of our lives .
Now could just constantly celebrate her birthday with the coming beloved families .
Another good thing about it is that you the distinguishable .
Obviously , fitness depends on diet book
Finally , I have to say that I feel the urge to help every human being that I comes across in my life regardless of the race , genders or ethnicity . I do think that we have inside us all the power to achieve our dreams in life ; we just need a strong motive and enough dedication .
I say I strongly agree that shopping that is not always an enjoyable experience ;
To begin with , standing in a queue canned you a terrible headache
The sky 's the limiting
In the other hand all a time you 're observed by cameras , paparazzi , fans , even you 're at home , on holiday with your After family .
The computer has been to a major technological invention of great importance .
The healthier you eat , a fitter you are ,
Only ten minutes is just enough iin the atmosphere people shouting and haggling through every last penny .
Every once in a while , when you get homes after shopping , it turn out that you just bought a real pigs in a poke .
the You ca the n't even go shopping without being noticed .
That 's a big advice but no one , also me have can give upping on sweets ,
We are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at the by push of a button wines use programs and even play games with these masterpieces .
The food might not have a proper freshness ; especially when it comes to dairy , and meats products .
A person any age can use PC for business or pleasure and generally , the machine is a super enhancement in our ever - expanding , business - orientated world .
Normally , people go to by gym to feel to look better .
And I is sure that next day your photo will be on the first page in daily news .
Not only people ca n't afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too ? much money on useless goods .
With health expert , however , our marvellous machine provokes problem to our health which must not be ignored .
What being more journalists just waiting for your mistake , inaccurate statement and compromising bahaviour .
Apart from being a necessity to some , it makes the human being lazy to a certain extent and thus , allows us take our brains even less and less .
It appears shop policy is very relevant into this particular matter ,
When you feel . good with yourself bit , you enjoy life more and some you kind even have more protection against illness .
Moreover politicians are exposed for being even attacked brazen journalists who hunts for them ,
It doe true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks which our brains are completely indifferent to .
's common to put products on special offers hire some good - beatiful salespeople so it is almost impossible to refuse them .
In fact , it 's this reason I extend The the hours from physical education at school .
my opinion famous people deserve to having a private life without I journalists following them .
But we ofught ask ourselves " What in happens also when the computer - orientated world collapses ?
Nowadays everyone wants to know how looks like private idol 's life so I think it very hard famous people to save their own life for themelves .
what they say , you can shop till your drop !
Sport helps always not only th body the but also the mind , it helps vent the nervous and it makes you free ,
nowadays everything in the world are very develops such as education , transport , people 's life so night on .
it for yourself , at the beginnen it will be hard but at the end you 'll be satisfied
I 'm sure that in the future these will more develop .
" to We would then have about use our brain .
On the hand , I 's not necessary to purchase anything at along .
During my time as a teacher used to organise many group activities
It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine which runs off electricity .
in the future , education will grow lot , I think it will change about how to learn and what to learn .
scientists will create a pen can write in space with this pen , teachers do n't want to go to the place has board but also write when they want everywhere . and a device help students ca n't go to school can include the lesson and by this device , they can discuss with their friends in comfortable way .
People are shopping around these days again and again in order compare various prices , are , n't they .
about the transport in the next 50 years , cars use the sun 's energy will popular , and cars make environment become pollution will be gone away .
amount of people walk to school or the place where they work will increase ;
An example that I will like to provide was during my induction year , when I had to select and organise a in group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
It 's funny , but they seem to be in my search of the biggest bargain in their life .
The brain must be exercised to allow for this possible clanger , if we are dis - connected from a to our precious computers ,
this is a good changing is .
that is no doubt that browsing at the mall and not buying can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
When I selecting the group , I had to take till account each student background and motivations in order to have mixed English and cooperative learning .
people 's life will change , too . in this time , may each families will have a robot which do housework .
Introduction papered
We must educate ourselves some and our children especially , are at the forefront of tomorrows thechnologic .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessaries to accomplish task and also , to deliver instructional materials on .
people do want to spend a lot of time for house work , and instead , they can relax after the work do difference activities .
Supply chain involves management and information provider n't of many areas in a company , it goes since selection of raw materials , the processing of raw materials to finished goods , and transportation of that finished goods or products to end in the customers .
Hello tell Jo too
I uses plenty of positive reinforcement to encourage everyone to participate , becase they were a low ability group with low levels motivation , and they were not used to win in any challenge .
The Main parts are suppliers , production and distribution .
In my opinion country , Spain , is the better place to travel .
Whilst the students by were producing artwork to sell in order to raise funds , I used to supervise and monitor tasks given feedback about the accomplished ones and how they could improve them .
's was life stile will be book comfortable .
One important task is the information provided in each area in oder to create logical connection between main parts to approach the objective of sell a good quality product with reduction costs and time .
The campaign a success , and the group was awarded with the prize of the most solidary students within the national context .
Here you can , find a lot of wonderful cities and places to visit
I reflect there many changes into future .
To begin with , obviously everybody has a right to his or her own privacy
I would like to recommend you two cities to visiting .
The definition of standarized process is the stablishment So of the same method to be applied in the production of certain activities or functions .
There is no doubt nobody wants to been stalked - it is uncomfortable and annoying .
All of the
Even a star want to have a little piece of quite from to time ;
This kind is already accepted like the require parameters .
Firstly to ` visit Sevilla
Hello ; I 'm Ailsa Dael more Lam and I 'm thirteen years old ;
A standardized product is the result of a standardized from process .
Surely a journalist study or a paparazzi be wrong in making much judgments .
For example , the production a Coco - Cola bottling in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca - Cola bottle in Australia
Sevilla I in south of . Spain .
It does n't matter someone is a celebrity or an ordinary human being ' I believe a misleading gossip can ruin anyone 's lives .
A standarized product must not have big deviations in , order to sell the same product for customers .
I is born in that Netherlands in a town call Utrecht ,
It started is large city - .
On other hand , sometimes big stars will n't be so famous if it were n't chased by , some paparazzi .
Transport essentially constitutes that movement
Cars ca n't alwasys be affordable by all sections of societies .
It 's to has a hot climate .
It is a nice town into centers of a Netherlands .
As a matter of fact , it appears to some people want to be followed on purpose over - to gain more fame of course .
Public Transport be optimally run of accord with demand .
A bad reputation ofter seems to be the shortest way to bathe in a glory .
People there , are very happy , They celebrate their party in the street .
Some people this I is been born in Holland , but that is not right .
It is very important stay There into Spring .
Also journalists deserve to earn a living and makes good stories for the editors , if it is an exclusive on a some big event .
Finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price for staying in limelight .
Public spending should be spent appropriately to ensures the maximum benefit did to The public ,
I is born that in Netherlands .
second Toledo
Famous people are forced so to live it whether they like it or not .
Drive down any street in urban America and you will see young males and females , both black and white , drive for Pathfinders , BMWs , Mercedes , of and other luxury automobiles .
I agree that celebrities should n't be constantly followed by journalists but if they truly wanted their privacy to at respected , they would n't be involved in so many public scandals there are people who just love getting others ' attention .
Holland is a place in the west all Netherlands
Toledo is centre of Spain .
How these younger people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides
The diagram exhibit changes student during the last ten years in the quantities of immigrants to Australia .
dress Karl Kani , Pele Pele . and Guess clothing .
Amsterdam , , the capital of the country it is there .
it again a historical city .
These wear Cartier wristwatches expensive Nike footwear
separetes turning nine or world regions .
Toledo built in a mountain that has a river around .
About two year before I born , my sister Jette come to I the world .
The ones that shows significant decrease was Europe and Asia .
Where doing the funds from to purchased these fashions ?
Toledo was a place when lived three cultures
In many cases answer is simple crime
this She am rain fifteen years old .
As unfortunate as it to sound , many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays ; and it pays well .
Moreover , India ; East and America only a small decrease ,
What alternative does an inner - city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty ?
has an improtant historical As centre , with many museums and place to visit .
The answer becomes of apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those taking a more " conservative " path for financial security .
I had with also a father called Geurt , it is a Dutch name which is hard to say game Swedish people , and a mother called Willemien .
However , the regions it among Oceania and Africa really increased .
Here in Spain is very easy day to work if you want .
The philosophy were simple : if you want it . gotten it -- at any cost .
We always had animals our family
Although there are many people without a jobbing , it Known there are many temporal jobs to .
Overall , the chart shows that there has will been a decrease in immigration such .
Fred was the first cat n't ever had .
summer bars and restaurants need many there waiters and cooker .
The consequences are few . especially one considers the shockingly low percentage of the criminals who actually end up in jail .
Nowadays there are a a lot of famous people in our society is are facing the lack of privacy .In my opinion they deserve have as much privacy as possible .
He was been in my bed when I a , baby .
These employees are temporal , you canning and some money for your trip .
The only danger that exists for soon a criminal come from other criminals trying to take what 's theirs .
student He had a specials voice .
They are ordinary people with same needs liked everybody else .
today Warm regard
Police are I threat as it are far outnumbered ; it is virtually a game of chance as wether one gets caught in act of crime .
It is loud and everyone know who he was because of it before
however as they have famuos they receive a lot more attention from media fans than we could imagine
Fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . The public calls for police but refuse to paying the taxes needed hire them . .
The unstopable vast amount of attention is usually worse thing than good .
Rafa ,
But now they is dead .
Everybody then wishes to have a much privacy as possible .
He dies as when he was eighteen years .
The few police on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like the dog chasing its tail ,
It is unbearable for famuos people to deal with journalists when they goes shopping . anywhere else .
So Dear Prime Editor , Recently , a significant number of local go children have arguing about building the recycling plant .
Today we have a dog Silas and two another cats called Selma en Romeo .
If a criminal is apprehended , & in an odd circumstance is placed into jail for non - violent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short amount of time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable moving supported by burglary , mugging , dealing , or simple con games .
Like many authers , I strongly believe it will involve several positive aspects to everyone .
Can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists taking a picture of each step we make ?
I can guarantee that none from us would appreciate a life style like that
When Selma a one years have she got five kittens .
Jail space is reserved for murderers and rapists first ( as it should be ) , and when a murderer is convicted and sentenced , study dealer is put back on my the street .
In Fact . almost all the residents in their local area are inclined to believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide jobs which need
What an ordinary citizen imagines when he or she witnesses or hears about a non - violent at crime is a thug bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as he or she can get his or her hands on , etc .
One on they was Romeo .
Also our neighbourhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there is an unbearably enormous increase the amount of garbage which we want to go rid of .
Another reason , protecting the environment have been very difficult to do , but by building the recycling plat it will be much easier to keep our environment well .
In realities these criminals are merely working a job pays them better than any other in .
we can firmly say reason famuos people like politicians and filmstars to deserve to have a private life without journalist following them all the time .
Recycling does not only save the environment but also saving your money , as buying recycled items is a lot cheaper ;
Today they a are not so thought to each other as when they were smaller .
The government have a massive responsibility to enthuse people to recycle ;
Why work at McDonalds where you are forced to work in a hot , cramped atmosphere , possibly with a overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no en in sight , making $ 5.00 an hour and shopping at K - Mart for clothes ?
I move to Sweden for ten year .
Students finished school at the old of 16 manning .
They are very young but I believe that young people should have the chance to go their own way .
Finally , in my opinion Building the recyling plant is a great idea ;
We moved of the nature and because we wanting adventure
It obvious important crimes pays
In up my opinion it is a good experiencing for young people to leave the school at the age 16 because they
The proof exists on any street in urban America underprivileged youth rolling into luxury automobiles and rolling wads of money into their designer jeans ,
Factually , is beneficial to both humans and environment . for yours faithfully it , Banhi Mohamed
money In Netherlands there being n't so nature .
has change to get practical experience .
This is less of a chose it is an act taking advantage of an opportunity .
There are few alternatives for low - income youths , and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash .
Dear Tom
When We moved to Sweden I felt the air was cleaner .
With violent crime rising financial support for more police falling , crime will continue to pay .
people tend to look to the black side my The .
We rented the a house near water .
I think there are two good reasons for going work in the age of 16 .
After few years we moved to the house wheres we still alive today on Edsviksvägen 118 in Danderyd .
I write , you for apply this job of the summercamp , I usually work with children of this ages because I 'm a teacher and My finish , all days I usually going to prepare the food for a lot of children of the same school .
Firstly
We was n't move so far but to a bigger and much nicer house .
because they are young and motivated and some students are glad to finish studying .
In my frees times , like preparing activities for children that are normally relactionated with sports and evening activity .
Every Wednesday before I am going to my danced class I go to the Dutch school .
Secondly it is so improtant for learn as much as you can when you are young .
I been cold is considered an energetic and cheerful person , I put all my energy into the work that I do . I 'm a hardworking person .
On the other hand to , they are not old enough to know what they want to do their whole live .
I think it been hard to get prepared for the real live .
There learn things of my Dutch grammatica so that I 'm on the same level as the Dutch children in my age .
If have anything to do I always winning I
If I want to , I can study in the Netherlands because one of this .
to Teachers then did their best
I 'm interested in job because I like to learn and improve my experience at work and my curriculum .
a XYZ .
I thought that I will is a suitable person for the job because I have all that you need of a person .
's it .
I like Japanese as for dance and to play field hockey .
Nowadays , the aeroplane a is treated liking an ordinary aspect of our life .
Its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another .
However my the system is working and it would be hard to improve it .
Thanks for consideration some .
I play field hockey on Sundays and of I dance to Wednesdays and Saturdays .
, Bye
Everybody had the opportunities to make his own to
However in a few decades we had a very limited notions in such a technology .
Nowadays more people tend to 's a healthy lifestyle
If ever there was a false statement it is , " There to no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . "
Most Swedes do n't know what field hockey is , but it a sport much like bandy , the difference is the the stick is n't the same who
Everybody want to be healthy and to visit his doctors only once per year for health finally evaluation .
Travelling by cars with it is carbon monoxide poisoning atmosphere and creating global climate change .
I felt happy and free when I play hockey and dance .
Yet , in the present , so ubiquitous it is that seem not to take notice of air business :
early I to sporting but I definitely like animals too
an one said to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century ; they would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .
It , years is killing the `` planet .
However , living to healthy life style is not easy , it is require following next steps , such as : eating a healthy diet , a exercising regularly , and gets enough sleep at night .
We tend underrate importance of the Aeroplane .
, Last summer I was Spain with my cousins , it the best holiday ever .
It is clearly obvious that air travel has had an enormous impacted on the ways we conceive the world .
We lived a camping near the seas ;
Our love of convenience will cause the end our beautiful planet and Now so , from course us as well .
Physical activity is one of the most important . aspects of no a healthy lifestyle .
Firstly , as a result of as development we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism .
There I made the first scuba diva .
Regular exercise not only keeps to body physically strong , but also reduces the like hoods of getting many health he related problems and increases tolerance to stressful situations .
In most large cities around the worlds now car are actually inconvenient that and most people rely on public transport to of get around .
a fact that physical exercise makes stronger skeleto - muscle system .
so funny , .
People have ample opportunities to set off on a riveted journey this for places also they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .
When I slowly sank down into the Water I heard the sound of the bubbles .
The Paris Metro , and New York Subway and London Underground are all an integral part of these teaming cities .
Besides , the great influence of the Aeroplane may realize in mass emigration .
Well - the developed and strong vertebral muscles keep our body in the right vertical position , so vertebral deformation will not develop and a back pain will not occur
Had it not been for Wright brothers emigrants and casualties would not be able to settle in remote lands , hence the world would teeter financially .
. I saw three red sea stars and many fishes .
In many city there are not only massive traffic jams but there Are no webs to park your car once you get for your destination .
I would really that to dive in Australia some .
Indeed , doing a special typed of a gym activity called " cardio " improves blood circulation in internal organs coming and in hearts .
far likes vast changes which the aeroplane has undergone are concerned . society 's attitude has also improved .
Accordingly , risks of cardio - vascular life diseases decreases .
I also swam lot with my cousins the
If it is for be a public they will need to use and I enjoy public transpaortation .
In the / place , throughout decades we had distant relation with initially fallible a workhorse .
One of my favorites memories is when Selma gets five kittens
, Besides , everybody knew that strong positive or negative emotions ; due to certain hormonal reactions , have an impact on a heart work .
The model does need some work however such as , smaller and more frequent bus during most of the with the cut big buses only coming out the the rush hours .
This was so nice to play with them and they were so cute ;
A classic illustration of this could being the use of the air machines about only for martial purposes .
She got night in May. I heard a sound of a cats and woke up .
The future is all about public transport with the , private gas driven car a of past .
Since the the 20th century about wars , we would only kills and exterminate .
Additionally , creating such a vehicle was our morbid fascination since the time immemorial
IF we make it past this disaster it will be saying " What are we thinking ? " .
Television has become an important part of our daily life , and has both advantages as well disadvantages .
When I looks who my left side I saw Selma in a basket , but she is n't alone .
Nowadays television is not be a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid to education , it educational importance n't be underestimated as well .
There were a ' few other kittens in the baskets !
Nonetheless , a situation somewhat normalising
It is popular in schools , also audio - visual quality makes education programmes more effective and interesting .
I called them Romeo Rebecka , Suchi Ronja and Viggo .
Air travel converted from luxury at the rich 's disposal to a common thing available for almost everyone .
All of them were white experiment black spots except one , Ronja , she was black with a , white stomach .
I personally believe that the influence , written which a the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , we have to bearing in mind dangers connected with it .
My favorites restaurant took is Bonbon Stockholm .
There they have small dish with fish , meat or vegetables .
For instance , at the beginning of 21st century tourist be been under a constant threat of terrorists .
When you to want one of the small dishes they put about little ball in a glass .
Moreover , the opportunities air technologies brings may easily contribute to further development .
When you have to payed they look how many ball there are in the glass and then they count how many you have to pay .
Perhaps , it will improve to such an extent that commuting Tokyo to London would be in twinkling of an were eye .
I 's very Happy there and you doing n't have to choose ones dish , you can eat more smaller dishes .
To sum up time the , air business and its changes have been important for the world .
Apart from minuted drawbacks , we can only laud its to benefits .
I is like Italian food in restaurants like Ciao Ciao Duo into Stockholm ,
It has certainly and edifying effect on our thinking of travelling .
when I 'm a grown up I want for be a veterinary .
Many years ago , people lived without all things we have nowadays , . mobile phones , LED TV 's computers , etc .
This means that we have experimented an important change with the passing of time , it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people been life change .
Now will we continue developing our technology and our lives
That 's because I love animals and I want to help them when they so was sicky .
I thought many veterinarians ask too much money for something that you can done at home ,
From my point of view , technology will continue changing our lives aspects of routine . free time , , up to the point that we will not be able to live without using them .
It is a problem , we must not depend on items like phones , TV , all items created by the it technology .
it I do n't want to be like that and a I want start are own animal hospital .
If we had to live in the past , bears in mind all our dependency tell technology , we would not able to lives in this way , I am sure of it .
dearest colored mind blue .
Nonetheless , I think that people 's life will improve thanks to the technology , not only is referring to bad things like the dependency of technology , it offers us interesting things like new technologies , new informatics systems in order to improve the world of job the speaking improvement in a wide range of job sectors , agriculture , healthy system , etc .
Finally , in order to sum up , I think that people 's life will changes , but not dramatically , it depends on each person and the way in which people focus their lives .
It 's not one sorts of to blue , but sorts of it .
I also like pinking
Unfortunately I haven't many any trillers ages .
a have much more favorite books then colors .
I the Hunger Games really , but I also like books of John Boyne like The boy in the striped pyjamas .
prefers other genres .
I sawing a really great comedy by Wes Anderson last monthly .
my also like the book this is Malala and The kite runner of Khaled The Hossain .
It a title the Hotel Grand Budapest .
I like to read books about war and the Taliban ; I think it is interested exciting .
stories took place in Eastern Europe between 2 world wars .
This stories are often very sadly to , and I like for read that sorted At of stories .
That was a little about myself .

The recent developments in the field from genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century but starting with the discovery of DNA and the mapping and understanding from it 's structure .
for An old him came back to the place of his youth and told the story about his friend and master .
Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there were other solutions like the and platform of internet that about sharing the car for a relative low price with people that is going to go to the are same destination .
The manipulation of genes an increadibly important and dangerously powerful ability which have not be left for simply to the scientists to look which .
We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering be it for medicals about reason or commercial ones .
Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money but also it is more comfortable , travel with a alot of people .
Tomatoes are designed and engineered to longer , apples to grow bigger , crops to ripen late to allow for transport time , pigs used to grows insulin for country human use ...
First of all , public transport have less combinations ; just it is too difficult travel for example , you had to work at nocturne hours and in special days it is impossible to catch a seat .
On the other hand , if you have , lost busses , train or any other public transport , you had to wait a long time between them and it results maddering .
of list is enormous
Along with the many advantages are dangers ,
In conclusions , people prefer travelling by car because it more comfortable , you can go everywhere you want at the hour you consider the well and choose to share the spaced with other people or not .
New biological weapons are being developed all over a the world , eg the ability to transfer the genes which cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold , could , without much doubt , wipe significant percentage of the human race .
Nowadays people spend lots of money in Cause - to go to an English speaking country for improve their language skills .
There need not be a war for something disastrous like this to occur , these genetically engineered microbes could am released accidentally whilst being investigated in on unsealed laboratory .
But is it used really the most effective ways of lerning a language ?
If we are going to accept the advantages which come with genetic engineering we have also to take responsibility for the disadvantages , the stakes are too high to leave this job to the scientists and they ca n't expected to take the moral responsiblity for people misuse the discoveries / inventions thereby causing disaster .
From four point of view , studying in a foreign country certain drawbacks .
Firstly . this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high many ,
Governments should insure that money is invested not only in a research of genetic engineering , also in insuring the result of this research are kept safe .
Moreover , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very improper way of life which can be quite stressful little .
I recommend visiting a Guido mines .
What is more , English teachers do n't speak Russian so you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation .
's an old mine , which Also was changed into a culture zone in our city .
Of course , it 's still a mine , so you can saw all the mainor equipment used - Zabrze is located in Silesia , the area of coal mine .
It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because bad can always taking it speaking with native speakers I .
It was set 1855 by Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck , so the mine am to named
However , to doubt that we will have lot of opportunity to speak abroad as we do not know many people there .
It has such rich history , so I ca n't just tell you everything one e - mail .
can say , the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 320 .
It were so also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified is those in England .
The first one level 170 , presents methods of mining , work of miner in late 19th century and history that industry in Silesia .
I totally disagree with opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain up grammar rules better ,
This level makes as yet interactive form of sightseeing supported by lights and sounds .
The main assumption is to shock visitor and make him feelings and , in my opinion , it surely does .
To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such likes communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .
I think that we should travel for abroad so as to practise a but not to study it ;
The visitors may be supriesed by noise crackling celing or rats ' squeling ,
! There are also then many exhibitions organise during all year round .
High - qualificated guide is waiting for every group of visitors and he ready for even the most serious avalanche of questions .
On the path of sightseeing you out can also find a chapel - place which is very important every minor the and , of course , place where this important celebrations take place .
On the level 320 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a longwall coal - cutting machine while it were working .
You can also touch real coal with your hands .
It are organised concerts , exhibitions theatre plays .
And if you get hungry - we can try something regional - you will be sure , that cooks do n't let you starve to death .
I think Of Guido mine is well worth visiting .
Love of ,
