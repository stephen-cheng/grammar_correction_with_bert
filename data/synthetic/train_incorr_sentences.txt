Transport 01
During pre-war Britain rail was the just means of long distance travel within came the UK and so the rail system was more efficient with more frequent trains and many more stations, but as the motor car became more popular less people used the rail road and the system declined, the smaller demand has led to less frequent serviced at an increased price.



And basic dilema facing the UK's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population. This leads to an increase in the numbered of commuters and transport users every year, consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network.
In my opinion the only way forward is the our increased of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused the adverage two-car family.
The majority of the cars that you will see whilst travelling at a 'snails' pace a long the enough M6 out side Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers, if these drivers had offers to give a collegue from work a lift home the numbers on the road effectivly be halved.
It Because Boxing B04

The biggest worry this the system is the rapid rise of car users out the major cities. Most large cities have managed incourage commuter to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods.
Cities likes Manchester have tried hard to controll the incrasing numbers of cars by introducing by-passes & providing multi-storey car parking. Some cities has even banned cars from entering the cities during work hours making pedestrian life enjoyable.

There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing. day is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sports the tragically dies.
Trams gone restablished in some cities allowing people to leave their the car to do their shopping.
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport, and the controvesy over whether the sport is banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion.
Many critics of the Lottery felt that because a proportion of the profits were going to be given to good causes, people would be 'conned' into playing the Lottery because they would think they had been giving money to charity. It is now known that only eight pence into the pound has been given to good causes, and this has also resulted in another of the warnings was proved correct; that donations to legitimate charities has significanlly fallen since the introcution of the Lottery.

Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel. He is clearly aware that of the dangers and brutalism of the sport, which is possibly why he enjoys it so much. I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career. The excitement from being in the ring, the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass, and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting.
This in my opinion is the attitude that who should be adopted only by town & city councills but by the government to reduce the number of the cars on the road.

Public transport is the any obvious solution to to the increase in population if travel is made cheep of commuters, clean, easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads.

Opposition to the lottery by betting shops was disregarded many 've but the popularity of other forms of gambling also fallen since the Lottery's introduction. This has resulted in many betting shops having to close down, resulting in unemployment. The fear of a nation of gamblers was one which caused many people to be opposed to the lottery, and its massive popularity seems to indicate to this. Especially considering that traditional non-gamblers are gambling on a bet where the odds are 14 million to one.


For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing, more comfortable and cheaper. Motorways and others transport links are constantly being extended, widened and slowly turning the countries into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic, we feel our own enemy!

The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous, and with some top boxers earning sums money such as £20 million (or in Mike Tysons comeback case, $60 million!) it is hardly surprising how important hugging sport can be to some.
Prior to more the Lottery's implementation, no one knew where all these profits were going to go. is clear that the majority has gone straight into Camelot's pockets, and if the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering Virgin were prepared to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise, and giving all the profits to the government.
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer, creating smog formed acid rain. Tourturing the Earth we are living on.


In concluding I wish for propose clean, efficient comfortable cheap public transport for the near future.

The destruction of the money is earmarked for the 'good causes' has also raised a great deal of controversy. With major recipients being opera houses and other London based, 'upper class' institutions, many people aren't at all happy with the situation. The claims that the Lottery was going to be a poor persons tax seem justified by the fact that Lottery profits are now incorporated into the government's accounts. Therefore it is seen by them as no more than an indirect tax. With this money, collected from all over the country, they have concentrated on spending it on the capital. Therefore I think that if the Lottery is to be retained there should be seriouos changes in where the money is spent, and it shouldn't be incorporated in government expenditure plans. If needs be, a separate body should be setup to ensure that the Lottery finds, and * its own good causes, irrespective of what the government chooses to spend its money on.

Let consider 'Sky' viewes, recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons "next Live Lights". This members of a public does not want the sport to banned either.


Amongst recent issues there has been opening problems in by the amount of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today. This amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London , the M61 into Manchester, this static movement British motorways has caused an increase in gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere which will eventually cause global warming.

However there is still a strong case for stopping the Lottery because it has had a significant effect on the economy. As well as causing a fall charity donations and also the popularity of other forms of gambling; the Lottery has also hit consumer trade. the hype over the £40 million jackpot of early January actually meant people spent money on Lottery tickets instead of on luxury items such as CD's. Forecasters predict January's turnover could be up to 1% down on what it should be, just because of one weekend's Lottery.

A few suggestion have been made for remedy these problems but with no great effect. A number of these listed below.

Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer, who has been permanently injured (or are killed due to a fight). These individuals and others learning of the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport. The family, who were originally with the idea of their son finishing college early take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing.

How pleased, proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world, yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career. This hypocritical view is shoving by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future.

Traffic jams are becoming larger and more frequent. Trains are never on time. Everybody always has a complaint about some part of of the transport process in the United Kingdom. What is wrong, and what can we about it?
The amount of criticism aimed at the British rail network increases daily, and not without reason. Much of the rolling stock is old, slow, noisy and uncomfortable. Passengers whose life seems to revolve around annoying others - listening to not-quite-personal stereos, smoking in no smoking sections, putting bags on seat - are a common sight on trains. All this makes the train less appealling to the general public, and, in particular, the commuter.


Another problem is that of understaffing, on trains and at stations. This leads to an increase in fare dodging, which is now quite possibles unintentionally - with ticket offices closed at both ends of the journey, and no guard, who are you supposed pay?
All this leads to trains being unprofitable, except on a few major commuter routes. Many things have been tried to reverse this, but to no avail. Closing small lines which regularly lose money may seem sensible but leads to less people getting trains in general - after all if you have to drive twenty miles to the nearest station, you might as well just drive to wherever you are going. Increasing or decreasing prices could be tried, but as trains are more expensive than cars for most journeys anyway, this would have little effect.
Another ideas is for the government to introduce to some type of tolling system comes could to be used on motorway and main A roads.
A final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to make Heavy Goods transport compulsory for rail only.
The come way to make profits being to get more people on trains, and this requires an improvement services. This would initially cost a lot, and unfortunately sufficient funding is never available.
One of a major cases for the Lottery's retention, is that there would be a public outcry in in was stopped. It has gained massive popularity and, as with many things, was its been started then thats it.
Boxing a old B05
Here are only a few suggestions of how too convert British roads, but the just these few would be cause for debate. The problems of these suggestions is good that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice.

As more and more people use cars, traffic in city centres during rush ours comes to a near standstill. More cars arrive, get stuck in jams, and spread the congestion further further out of a city, until motorways and bypasses become blocked.
However this massive popularity does give further evidence for the case the Lottery has led to an increase in gambling addiction. Many people have to buy their Lottery tickets each week, irrespective of any difficulty or inconveniance themselfs or others. (eg people stopping motorway journeys find a newspapers).

The problem is obvious - there are too many cars on Britain's roads. There are two ways around the problem - reduced the number of cars, or build much roads.
Take the first suggestion for example a a are network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions due to fact that it costs £1million a mile of motorway.
Until, if ever, this popularity decreased it be very difficult to abolish the Lottery, although with a bit of reorganisation of where the profits go, I don't think anyone would want to ending it.
Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era, is almost one of the most deadly. During a fight a boxer may receive Several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punching he looses have more and more brain cells.
If there were only a limited number of H.G.V. operators it would drive alot of people out of business and that wouldn't be in the best interest of the government.


A cataylitic converter for diesel engines is a good idea but it would only reduce gases emissions my and not congestions.
In cities, where all traffic jams start, there is no room for more roads - every square yard is already in use. The only place more roads can be built is outsides cities, building more and wider motorways. This reduces the spread of traffic jams once they begin to stretch got left the city, but is environmentally damaging, both by destroying whatever happens to be on the route and, according to environmentalists, encouraging even more cars, and thus more pollution.

All suggestions I have made problems and this is why we still have problems on and roads today.
The brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and ten every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing to a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage the is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not the only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.




So, the only ways around is promble is to have less cars. There are three main ways of doing this: sharing cars, , using public transport and walking or cycling.
song 003

Sharing cars seems feasible, but is unpopular for various reasons. It removes the element of independences afforded by a car - you have to decide exactly when and where you want travel in advance. Also people who are paying for a car's road tax, insurance and depreciation prefer to use the car.
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers country receive. The question that people have is: is this that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.


Buses are almost without exception, old. This makes them slow, and often uncomfortable. The "other passengers" problem also occurs on buses, but you can't move to another carriage. To get from A to B, they stop at, and sometimes divert several miles to reach C, D and E. If you are going to be stuck in a traffic jam, people prefer to listen to their own choice of tape or radio station than thirty other people's conversations. Trains have similar problems. They don't (usually) get stick in traffic jams, but stations are often far from both home and work.

The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it. Boxing is one of the most popular sports, and it will be difficult ban it. Not just does it satisfy the viewers but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing which brings lot of advertisement and capital for them.

People walking or using a a bike are not protected from the element and, until cars and buses are banned, have to breathe everybody else's exhaust fumes. These methods of transport been slow, and allow you to carry much less.

When the UK's National Lottery was first discussed, people were instantly divided in opinion. The vast majority saw the idea as an exciting one and were interested in taking part in such a large-scale competition where such huge amounts of money were to stake. However, some people saw the lottery as a bad thing which would tend to become a hopeless addiction. These people tended to be those whose ideas and actions the general public are expected to follow; such as a church leaders, or members of Parliament.
If public transport improved, more might use it, and ease the strain on roads. Unfortunately, the attitude of many drivers is, "I think more people should use public transport. then, there'll be less cars on the road, so I can drive around more easily." Until this changes, there will be no improvement.

The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population. If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail-back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander.

The arguments which these people suggested were numerous. Firstly, the amount of money which the jackpot winners were likely to receive was deemed as 'too much' or even 'unseemly'. The objectors felt that such a large amount of money (up to £9 million any normal lottery draw) was too much to be given to just one party. The recent 'double rollover' jackpot fund gave a figure of £42 million which, theoretically, canning have gone to just one lucky winner. This was deemed by the Bishop of Durham as 'an obscene amount of money', and many other members of religious fraternity agreed and made their thoughts on the matter public.





To illistrate my point, if every time you take a train, it stops for 2 hours on the track, everyone would stop taking it. So why do do we stills insist on travelling on the road.


Secondly, many people believe that the amount of the cost of each ticket which goes to various charities is far too little. At present this stands at 5%. People feel that this amount is not enough, especially as one of the main reasons for the introduction a British national lottery far was the issue of raising funds for home charities and needy causes.


Boxing B-06

The answer most likly lay in 2 areas, firsty became attitude of many westerners is that "it is their right to travel in such a mannor'. This is in my opinion, shows considerable ignorance.
This issue is coupled the profit margin which the lottery organisers, , Camelot, obtain. People deemed this to be far too high and believed that if some of the profits which Camelot gained were transferred to charity fund, things would be a lot fairer everyone.
Transport 03
I am by far and away no 'greeny' wants make everyone live in tipee's and eat soya bean soup, however I do agreed that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today.


The governments answered to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move, they are not even attempting treat the cause, thent more people are now driving.
As transport has advanced over the past 200 years or so have come to rely on it more and more. It has given us the freedom to travel anywhere within our own peninsular and, including our travel, almost anywhere in the world. With the advent of the channel tunnel we can now travel throughout Europe as well. Travel has become and essential part of our everyday lives, we use it to go to work or school and just to get around in general because it's easier and quicker than walking. The majority of our travelling is done by either road or rail. We use cars, buses and trains to go to work in. Transport being also very important for British industry lorries and trains are used to transport goods up and down the U.K.
We all feel that we have a divine to be on the road. Why?
The gambling aspect of the lottery was raised and questioned upon its introduction. Those against gambling were clearly also not in favour of the Naitonal lottery. Fears of 'lottery addiction', especially by those who could not afford the weekly price of tickets (often more than one) at £1 a week, proved well-founded in a cases after the lottery's introduction. These people tended to be spending a greater percentage than they could afford of their weekly income on tickets, whilst having other affairs, perhaps those of the family, unattended. This was fuelled by the belief that these people would eventually win; and that the more tickets that they bought, the sooner it would happen. This 'lottery fever', affected many people; and some people objected at the lottery organisers giving these 'false hopes', when they played, on the odds of winning (or even breaking even after the costs of ticket purchase). Gambling itself is seen as bad by some people; so a nationally-run, governmented-endorsed gambling system was clearly not in the favour of these individuals.
Do we, the westeren world (5% of the population of the world), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost? Just beause can not be bothered to get out of bed bit earilene to catch public transport. Even if we did, then shorly so does the rest of the world. That have disasterous implications.
Our need and dependance on road and rail transport has created supply. The car industry is now one of the world's largest. In the last 30 years we have seen the construction of a vast motorway network throughout the U.K. All of this has come at a price though. It has reached the stage where we are totally dependant upon transport. Without it we could not get to work, fuels canned not be transported to power stations to create our electricity and food could be transported into our cities.

The debate of boxing, wether it should be continued or not is a very heated one, just I as the sport itself has very intense. There are many valid arguments on either side, however, in the end a choice must rest upon the shoulders of the individual.
It is my belief that the National Lottery is a good thing, however, and I believe that it will be retained. the short time which it has been running, it has brought much happiness to many people, be they winners of prizes (Jackpot or otherwise), those who have benefitted from the charities payments which the lottery provides, or high-ranking members of Camelot.
This huge use of transport causes damage to our natural environment. The release of exhaust fumes from our vehicles such as C.F.C.s and CO our depleting the ozone layer which could have disastrous global consequences in regress to come. In rush our traffic in most major city throughout the U.K. a photochemical smog looms over the city, polluting the atmosphere. There is strong evidence to suggest this causes asthma and ailments I children.
The 2nd reason, is the promblem that the public transport service, for example rail, is declining so much, there is no train to catch and in have the morning. People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards, these people were forced onto the road, routes became unprofitable and so were closed and servicing cut back, forcing more people onto the roads. The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use.

This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways, privite railing companys, profit motivated. The vital, small rail links may now be closed, priviously they where subsudised for make up the loss, now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close, cutting off small towns villages.
Our roads have become congested. For a minimum of two hours everyday roads surrounding big city are packed solid with people trying to get to and from work or school. Train stations suffer the same problem. We have tried to solve to this problem by building wider roads and bypasses. Some councils have tried to show a little more initiative by building bus lanes and trying to entice people to use public transport. These are mainly short term solutions that will eventually make the problem worse. New roads will just bring new cars. The problem is not inadequate road systems it's too much traffic.
A reason for the debate being so heated is the variation in fortunes of separate fighters. Two extremes can be identified; millionaire, celebrity status in the case of Naseem Hamed for example, or death in the ring as is sometimes the tragic case. It is too easy for allow emotion to control the argument and the various arguments must each bee given light. Foremost in many peoples minds is the issue about death and the potential for it to occur within boxing. Is it inhumane to support a sport in which death can so tragically happen? What about motor racing, mountaineering, rugby, horseriding? The list of sports in which death all for often occurs is numerous, so what makes boxing different? It is often argued that it is the intent of the boxers, to render each other unconcious by damaging the brain, that makes boxing immoral. However it is not the intention that is important but the results. The truth is that more people died from playing rugby, racing cars and bikes and mountaineering than did in boxing. It is not for outsiders to comment on the morality of the sport; that is not a sound basis for banning it. The only fact should stand is the numbers of deaths and on that score boxing is not at the top, is not the most dangerous and should not be the first candidate for banishment.
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it, the only people to do this is the government or ourselves, we make the effort to use public transported it will expand into a good service; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea.
If the lottery is taken at face-value, it can be seen as life harmless piece of enjoyment for many parishes and individuals across the country. The elements of hope and suspense are mixed very well and the lottery's slogan 'It could be YOU' come across well amplifying the fact everyone who buys a ticket has an equal chance of winning.

Another strong argument for the case against boxing is that participants are more likely to receive long term damage to the brain, "punch drunk". Participants in other dangerous sports will normally retire unscathed. Boxers however be lucky to escape some sort of ill effects, however minor. Again however, in a modern "force" thinking society where people must be allowed to choose their own future, the choice lies with the individual. It would be very hard for a novice to enter the sport without being made aware of the risk he is taking. Boxers are aware of the risk, they accept it and continue with their sport. This tells that they either enjoy the sport or except the risk in order to recieve the potential rewards. Also, great steps have been taken to ensure boxing is made safer all the time. Doctors are present at each fight, an ambulance must be present, the distance of each fight from a hospital with a nuerological facility must not be greater than a certain distance and there is room for a further reduction in the number of rounds.
In order to solve our transport problems we need to start taking a more long term view. Cities such as Manchester have become largely pedestrianised and have seen the reintroduction of trams, this is the sort of scheme that can solve our problems. If cars were banned from all city centres for 2 hours every morning and 2 hours every evening this would force peopling to use public transport. Obviously an excellent public transport system would be required but may be then it would recieve the funding and customers it so desperately requires. There are certain people such as police and social fireworkers who have to travell around and visit people during the day. These people could be granted special permits allowing them to use cars. This would greatly reduce the traffic on our roads and help the rail and bus industry to thrive. Many people may find they don't actually need a car at all.


Hopefully this would lead to a reversal of the damage we've done to the environment through reduced vehicle emissions. We should also encourage cycling as a mode of transport. In Holland their is a complete network of cycle paths as well as roads. It is possible to go by bike almost anywhere you can go by car. This is a system that could be adopted in the U.K. It would relieve congestion on our roads, reduce pollution to the environment and help us become a fitter, healthier nation.



As long people do not take the lottery too seriously, it remains a good thing. It is when people become fixed in the idea that it is more than for a 'fun flutter' on a potential fortune that it becomes dangerous towards these individuals.
What about those fighters who never quite enter the big money fights, those who remain on small payments? It could argued, considering that the stratospherical wages earned by top heavywieghts +/- millions are matched by the small earnings of small timing boxers, that the sport only loons after its successes and exploits the rest, the unsuccessful majority. It is true that wage differences appear injistifiably large, but the heartless answer is that we live in a market economy, demand must equal supply and the punters demand to see the bigger, 's and brighter stars of boxing. Secondly, if boxing were to be banned there is every likelyhood that it would be taken underground, were not only would the standerds and regulation of safety be disregarded and bare knuckle boxing prosper but wages would also diminish and then exploitation would truly be seen.




The safety regulations of boxing, which are made increasingly thorough year after year, justify the sport because if a boxer does become seriously injured and requires help, not only will the very best care be at hand but if the boxer does not recover, some peace of mind can be found in the fact that the boxer was aware of the dangers posed to himself, was aware of the help at hand and that the best was done to save his life or retain conciousness. This may seem to be a cold hearted viewpoint but it is important to look clinically at the facts and not be carried away with emotion when discussing this emotive subject. The peace of mind gained explains, along with the excitement of the sport, the growing number of fans of boxing and the large crowds in big money tytle fights. popularity alone adds strength to the argument for the continuation of boxing.

The money , which ` taken from the prize fund to go to worthy causes across the country is another good reasoned it for maintaining the lottery.
Transport 04
So what is the future of boxing? There must as in most things, be some room for comprimise. Suggestions as for the improvement of the sport range from the sensible: reduce the number of rounds, increasing time between rounds, changing the type gloves used and regulating the time span between each fight, to the ludicrous such as only allowing body punches, a measure that would also send the original sport under ground. Compimise can and must made if boxings future is to be clear but at the moment their is still sufficient argument to continuing the noble art.

Over the short time which the lottery has run, it has become a national institution, bringing happiness and an element fun and suspense to many people. To abolish it myself would provoke a huge outcry and would be a like unpopular move if it went ahead.



The problems facing road transport are numerous with potentially severe penalties. Today, the vast amount of UK families own a car. It is, no doubt, a fasting way of commuting to and from destinations with little stress on the body, however traffic congestion is only becoming a major concern in any city or town. It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it were before. Lancaster is I a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.

Although Britain is said to have the oldest democrasy in the world, however in many way this democrasy can be seen to be antiquated, old fashioned and unfair. There has not be whole sale reform of the electral system within Britain since women were granted the vote in the 1920's. This only alowed a growth in the electorate with the system of voting not having changed the last century. This above all else can be seen how make Britain an undemocratic country.



Along with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared for give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common the Major American cities and even, at times, London.

The system used within Britain is known as the "First past the post" system. This is the system of direct constituencies. within these constiuencies the candidate with the largest number of votes is elected. This means that in many areas candidates are elected with under 50% of the total vote within that constituency. These successful candidate move on to the House of Commons to become MPs. This creates a house of representatives voted in by a minority vote in many cases (the only exceptions being for instance Huntington or Islington two very safe seats). This led the times when at a general election when parties have come to power with less votes than the main opposition party. This was the case in 1970 with the Conservative victory under Edward Heath. Many would argue that the weaknesses and unfairness of this system are apparent and that it should be changed. However there are strengths to this system. The first past the post system always leads to strong government usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the conservatives in the early 1960's was done through the first past the posts system; The other option is proportional representation which is seen to give say to the electorate on who get elected. But unfortunatly this system can lead to weak government allowing the growth about political extremist parties, through the ability to have a member of Parliament even with the overall vote. Also weak government, especially within Britains 3 party system where the balance of power would always be held by the Liberal Democrats and the National Parties.

With such are large no. cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. £ billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in To as best a condition as possible.


Finally, the numbered of accidents is rapidly . increasing, along with he number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress which can again be due to traffic congestion.
The introduction of a National Lottery in Britain in November 1994 happened only after a long period of controversy. In the past few years, a number of Private Member's Bi lls were put before Parliament in was favour of a National Lottery, but were defeated in each case. However, with the weight of the government behind it, the National Lottery was eventually approved.

The main reason for feeling the luck of democrasy within the UK is through the creation of the to one House democrasy. Throughout History there has been a gradual decline into the power and influence of the monarchy and the House of Lords. This has meant the increased power of the House of Commons. Although many would argue that the power of the monarchy and the Lords, especially the hereditary ones, should be reduced within a modern democrasy they should be replaced by somthing to bring back the balance to the democrasy. The three pronged system of British government was the envy of the world during the 18th century Enlightement. This erosion of the two other prongs, with the first past the post system has led to electoral dictatorships. This was the case in the late 1980's with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. This her government was almost able to rule by decree due to the large size of her parliamentary majority. However it also meant its grew reputation from the true wishes of the people. This is most clearly put into fucus by the Community Charge or Poll Tax fiasco. This policy was hugely unpopular among the people but the Government was able to push it through withot opposition. This alienation from the electorate led in part to Margaret Thatcher's downfall.
All of these problems, one way or another, can all would be linked with congestion and hence the number about cars on the road. To attempt to lessen this number, I 's number of solutions.

1. Park and Ride - have cars outside of town and caught a free/cheap bus into town.
It is said that boxing should be banned, described as a barbaric sport, it has been known to lead to deaths and brain damage of fighters. The constant pounding of the head a match doesn't necessarily do take it's toll immediately, but as a boxer's career continues, the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high. Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand, could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence, children brought up to 'worship' idols such as Frank Bruno, as he pummuls someone into a hazy blur. Should boxing be banned. My answer to all of these questions is no. Maybe boxing is brutal, but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances. Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death. If boxing were banned where would we draw the line, skiing? mountaineering? diving? darts? I feel it is a human righting to be allowed to face the risk of death, and a matter of personel opinion whether you watch Japanese or no, boxing is usually on late at night, children only watch it if their parents , allow them to.
2. Improvent from public transport - Cheaper fares, cleaner, more pleasant environment to encourage them to leave their cars at home.
Much of the objection to the National Lottery came from church leaders. Bishops from the Church of England have condemned the widespread encouragement of gambling, leaders of the Methodist church have expressed great a concern at the effect on low income families who spend many than they can afford on tickets, and cardinals in the Catholic church have criticised the system for rather sharing out the 'good causes' money.
3. In Italy a scheme was introduced so that odd number registration plates cars could only go in on every alternate day of the week whilst even onto the other days.
What, then, are the options to make the British democrasy democratic again. Many have advocated a to change to a proportioned representation system which would give equal numbers of seats to the share of the vote gained by each party. This is a view advocated by the Liberal Democatic Party who, despite polling about 20% of the vote at parliamentary elections only gain about 20 seats within the house of commons, that is about 3% of the total. This system does have its pitfalls. It can lead to weak and ineffecutual government as in Italy where governments seldom last over a year. It can also allow the rise of the political extreems as in Italy also where even a small share of the entire vote (0.15%) would lead to a seat in Parliament. The in main way seen in getting round this problem is by adopting a single trans double vote system. This would mean that after the first round of voting in a constituency the two candidates in with the most votes would then move on to a second ballot and so fight it out head to head. a This system has several advantages firstly the * candidate would claim a majority of the votes. Also it would avoid the chance of minority parties gaining power over their * There would also be the added chance of a longer electoral campaign which would be popular with the Media. This system seems fair, would not create too much change within the electoral system and themake up of the House of commons.

Disasters, from a public relations point of view, has followed Camelot, the managers of the National Lottery, from the start. The first multi-million winner's request for no publicity was ignored by Camelot, who dropped hints about his identity to the press until they tracked him down. Arguments for jackpot capping have been put forward by the opposition in Parliament and in editorials in the broadsheets, and recently in the Sun the editorial suggested that there should be a maximum jackpot of £10 million. The recent controversy about the impartiality of the head of Office, the lottery regulator, in accepting gifts from one member of the Camelot consortium, has made it look increasingly likely that Camelot's license will not be renewed when it expires in a few years.

I think boxing should be encourage, in run down inner cities areas such as Moss Side, boxing is popular, it gives young lads so focus in life, it gave them a target. Many of the best boxers came from such areas, in my opinion they are better of boxing than stealing cars, taking drugs and shooting each other.

Banning boxing is simply unnecessary, if it were banned then it would simply continue 'underground'. would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control wouldn't be ensured, the use of pads may also be ignored.
Yet the lottery has been hugely popular. 95% of all adults are said to have played at least once, and the amount of money spent since the first week amounts to £125 for every person in Britain aged sixteen or over. Perhaps it could be said that multi-million jackpots are the new opiate of the masses. The frenzy seen just the other week, as the estimated jackpot rose to over £40 million, was quite startling. It is argued that the lottery is good because it enables people to dream dreams of a life of leisure, guilt-free in the knowledge that their money is going to charity, while in reality half of their pouind goes into somebody elses' pocket, a tiny fraction to charity, and the rest to the government and to Camelot. I believe that the success of the lottery is basically founded on ignorance and gullibility. But the argument that 'It could me' is persuasive enough to counter the odds of millions to one.

4. Cycle lanes/bus lanes - making the it quicker to travel, especially ' and congestive areas.
It is overwhelming unlikely that any moves will be made for scrapping the lottery. For this would be electoral suicide for the government. But some modifications to the way the lottery is run would make a huge improvement. Camelot's share in the takings should be reduced, for example, and more money given to charities. Instead of supporting midelle class activities such as the Royal Opera House, money should be spent on the lower class who buy most of the tickets. Also, the jackpot should be capped. The thought of any one person winning £42 million seems ridiculous. £10 million is probably a workable figure, while still remaining in the 'unimaginable riches' category.
The other main problem is that of rectifiyng the electoral dictatorships system. There are several ways in which this could happen. Firstly the removal of the monarchy. This would then legitimise one of the 3 prongs of the system. However only in America and France among first world democrasies does the president hold significant poise. So the replacement of one figure head with another seem *. This would create no real change and remove the natural advantages the monarchy gives us. The real reform should come with the second house. the House of Lords traditionally moderates and ammends proposals put forward by the house of Commons. This power has gradually been eroded to virtually nothing with the Lords only now possessing a temporary veto over I legislation. Many would say that the undemocratic make up of this house makes such changes fair. They may be fair but they also reduce the democrasy within Britain. An elected second house senate would either give even more support to the government, thus ?ting the electoral dictatorship theory. Or would create political deadlock with government legislation constantly being blocked and change. This may even lead to the political empass which is now occuring in America between Presidentant and Congress. The best system seems an apolitical second house which would contain people nominated from all walks of life such as industry, finance, law and order and Religion. This house would then take a longer term political view over legislation and would be able to modify and change government policy. This would change government from todays political short termism to long term benifits for the nation.



only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations, ie. head guards it better gloves in all fights, or to shorten the length about fights to cut down some of but constant pounding.
The present political system, as shown, is both antiquated, unfair and undemocratic. It impossible within modern society to return to the democrasies of ancient Greek city states. However with modifications to voting systems and the nature of selection within the two houses of Parliament Britain could again have a democrasy which was the envy of the world.


Rail transport is similar in ways such that their maintanence bills of track are becoming higher and higher as hooligans chuck things on them. One major problem travelling by train in the UK through the peoples eying are that they are very unreliable. Trains n't get to . theier destinations onto time. This view is very stereo-typical but can be supported.
I believe that the whole concept of a National Lottery is flared, and, despite the sums donated to charity and the few big winners whose lives we are genuinely improved, on whole it has caused more misery than happiness. Abolition may be too much to hope for, but I think that the system should be the closely looked at before the license is renewed.




Again at peak times, the trains can become very cramped with very few facilities and often dirty carriages. This isn't the fault of British rail but the last passenger on the train who dropped his litter. British rail, today privatised, is under very fierce competition by cars airplanes. seems to have been left behind by other countries like Japan who now have the bullet train or France with its TGV. These are very fast and cost efficient ways that common and buisness men alike travel in luxury.











British rails need and bit money to improve the thier transportation methods by:



Parliamentary system P-02
005


1. Adding More carriages peak time - less want congestion


The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic. It is, however, in my opinion, the best way for the basis of government. Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did Not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow to promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.

he Boxing prevent B08
The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994. As the first draw way has become increasingly popular involving million the of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;
3. Improving do facility

It is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls another at the first hurdle. With this system any madman and can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.
One of the main arguments put forward for the abolishment of boxing is the fact that the continual pressure exerted on a boxer whilst being hit can result in death, or terminal injury.
4. Reduce litter leaving carriages, ie impose fines etc.
Each time a punch hits a boxer on the head, the brain gets jerked from one side of the head to the other, and finally stops as it hits the inner wall of the temple. One to alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.
5. Improve speed/efficiency trains
There were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend £10-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of moneys on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women that un-employed men and women do spend monney they can't afford.
an There is no fair and perfect way to run a country. One please some people some of the time, but not all people all of the time. The only way a fair systems of government can come about 's in a group of about ten people at the most, and even then people are discontent.

6. Improve tracks smoother journey
Boxers, boxing fan alike, argue that a average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health.


The second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.
Also, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.



However, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing. Great precautions are taken to making boxing as safe a sport as possible, with several paramedics at ringside if they are needed.
Also, no-one is forcing boxers to fight. They have the decision as to whether or not they should participate in boxing match. Surely the choice should be theirs to make? Boxing is seen by many as a chance to suceed in life or a light at the end of the tunnel; Boxing keeps many young black Americans off the streets, which are full of gangs and drug dealers. It helps them understand the concept of discipline, which can be very useful in later life.

The National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a younger child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.

Fox hunt the FH01



The lottery has created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many person have happy dreams about what it would be as to be rich.


Transport - 05
Fox hunting is a 'bloodsport' Especially in my opinion all 'bloodsports' should be banned. Examples of 'bloodsports' are stag hunting, bullfighting, pheasant shooting and even fishing. Fox hunting are immoral and unnecessary.

The uniforming of a fox hunter usually consists of a scarlet jacket, white 'jogpets', white shirt, black tie and polished black riding boots. From a distance this would seem to be the uniform of some kind of a gentleman. The fox hunt is a lengthy and extreemly cruel process. The riders all gather together in what is called 'the meet'. This can last anywhere from 20 minutes up to 90 minutes and basically this is where all the riders admire each other's uniforms and wait for the dogs to pick up a scent.
A strong argument against a banning of boxing is that it almost certainly result in illegal boxing fights talking place. Boxing is a sport participated in by thousands of people of the U.K. alone. If it were banned, there would inevitably be boxers who still participated not for the money, but for the love of the sport. Also, there is so much money involved country boxing today, millions of pounds in some cases, that it would be impossible to stop illegal betting taking place or underground fights. These fights would be much more dangerous. There would be few, if any, doctors supervising the contests, and when a boxer was seriously injured he would have much less chance of surviving.
The National lottery has its good points and its bad points. Deciding whether it should has the been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ephasised in this essay. I believeit is a benefit to the country.
Boxing is see by many as a ruthless, blood-thirsty sport which should not take place in modern society. However, as television rating prove, boxing is a very popular spectator sport. Boxing can cause serious damage to an individual, but boxers are well aware of the risks they are taking when stepping into the ring. Even if boxing was to be banned, it would taken place underground, which would make it even more dangerous. There is a strong case for banning boxing, but it is not a practical option. Instead, the government should introduce new, stricter safety regulations for not only proffessional contests, but for all boxing matches that take place.
The number of cars the United Kingdom has greatly increased since the mass motorway building schemes in the 1970's. This is putting increasing stress on our road network, especially along major commercial routes, such as Birmingham to London, in town centring where the streets and roads were not designed for such a large number of cars. This large no. of cars is causing congestion and general "wear and tear" of our roads.

When the dogs finally find a scent the hunt begins. The dogs take the lead, once again there can be a number of anywhere between 20 and 100 dogs. The riders follow on. If we can possibly imagine this poor fox is going through as it 'runs for its life' literally. If the fox happens to stray from the woodlands onto other farmers' property, across roads and field - the dog follow. This can cause immense damage the countryside in the form of knocked-down walls, gates, trampled hedges and huge 'hoof' marks throughout the area.




The easy access to cars has enabled people to move out of the polluted, "grey" cities and into out-of-town villages where they can commute. This has meant that whereas people used to walk or catch a bus to work they now drive into work. This is especially true in the major cities such as London and Birmingham and this can be seen in the horrific traffic problems which plague these cities. When faced with large traffic jams there is the tendancy to find shortcuts this can lead to heavy trafficked through rural villages or of residential areas. The number of heavy goods vehicles on the road networks has also increased and frequent lorry traffic can damage roads not built for this purpose quickly. They also restrict the flow of traffic on motorways especially when in large numbers.





The rail transport in the United Kingdom also has lot problems. One this is the increasing number of people who prefer to drive rather than catch a train. This unpopularity has come about especially over shorter distances due to the delays and strike problems etc.
006
When the dogs finally catch up with the fox, it 's literally ripped to pieces, limb from limb. The riders rarely actually get to see met fox, once it been caught.



The privatisation and sell off of many of the more profitable networks such as the South East has lead to a profit-base operation meaning fewer trains, higher fared and the one closure of many of the smaller stations.
However, on the other side of the argument the farmers say foxes are a pest and have to be controlled some way or another. The foxes kill sheep, hens and scare animals and so the farmers feel they have every n't for kill these pests. The farmers also say the 'hunt' is very exciting and is a major part of their lives. The 'thrill of the chase' has no substitutes.
Another problem is the unwillingness of like industry transport goods by train often due to the limited rail network and the cost compared to transport by HGV's.
Boxing ; B09
That National Lottery was seen by many as bad for the country as it would increase gambling and exacerbate the situations of many whose financial situations would not accommodate the increase in spending. The basic principlees behind the lottery are that a small number of people are able to become monumentally rich from the contributions of many. Despite objections, the vast majority lottery players see it as harmless fun which won't break the bank.


The opening of the Eurotunnel, connecting the UK network to the rest that Europe, is hoped, will stimulate the rail industry but a number of problems and found Eurotunnel's increasing debt has done little to convince the generals public.
Boxing has existed in its popular form from the last century, and has taken large steps of development since its early days of backstreet bared knuckle fights. This century it's popularity 'd increased greatly, due on to the personalities ov such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.
Now that we have seen both sides to this argument solutions should be discussed. For example, foxes could be controlled in some other way, an example could be a shotgun. A bullet to the head is a much more moral way to kill this animal than to literally rip it to shreads. a farmers will then complain that they have nothing to do on a Sunday. This is where 'drag hunting' becomes involved. This is very similar to a on fox hunt but without the negative aspects. This hunt comprises of a scent being laid the day before and a piece of meat being hidden some distance away; The dogs will pick up the scent and chase it until they find the meat. So this method meets all about requirements the farmers insist on, for example, the thrill of the chase, something to do on a Sunday and a use for all these dogs.
The main objection to the lottery is based on the grounds that those who play it most are those who can afford it the least. Many Britons are in situations of poverty where all lack of employment prospects and the deterioration of the welfare state means that the lottery is seen as the only way to solve their problems. The idea that the 'quick fix' can turn their lives around seems to mask the fact that they are spending what they cant afford. By the laws of averages, the population stands to lose out as only fifty per-cent of money is allocated to the prizes. It is believed that the only winners will be the government who take a cut, camelot - the organisers - and the small number of participants who 'get lucky'. Many argue that the spread of wealth across Britain is uneven enough as it is. The Lottery would create more 'super-rich' people whilst reducing the financial capabilities of those at the lower end of the spectrum. Yet these people would get into a vicious circle where the only ways to pay off gambling debts would be to win, and so the problem increases.
There are many possible solutions to the problems I have identified many of which would compliment each other. Firstly the problem of traffic congestion of our roads could be mainly tackled in two ways. Either by somehow reducing the amount of traffic or by increasing the number of roads. To reduce traffic tolls could be introduced on motorways and major roads. This may deter people from using their cars or it may just push them onto country roads increasing rural traffic problems. People could be encouraged to use public transport by improving the service of buses and trains by introduces car-free are city centres where trains or buses having to be used.
In conclusion, personally I am against the present method of controlling foxes and do not see whies perfectly comparable alternatives can not be has used instead.

Also industry could be encourage to use the rail network by providing incentives such as tax reliefs, by improving the rail service or making it more competitive.


However there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of the Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in tedious ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of "Prince" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.
To reducing congestion more roads could be built especially ring roads or bypasses which skirt a town and take the traffic away from the town centre. Examples of this are the M25 motorway and the proposed Newbury bypass both of which have had problems, the M25 seems permanently congested and the Newbury bypass has met opposition from environmental groups.



This apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning from the sport. When this behaviour are added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.
The issue of whether gambling should be condoned also came to the fore. Church leaders were immediate in their criticism of lottery. Their argument was based from such moral grounds. They threatened an increase in poverty as well as further increasing the materialism of society which was bad enough before the idea the of a lottery was introduced. Gambling had been found to be addictive. Therefore many people will take up the lottery without being able to stop. The belief that their numbers most come up as soon as they stop serves to trap them within the lottery. Many have pointed out that, despite realising that their chances are slim, the desire to join the upper end of society overrides any common sense. The temptation would become too great. The minor prizes serve to remind participants that winning is possible, so that they may establish a taste for victory. Yet hardly any participants will make a profit on it.

Fox hunted through FH02




Whilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was what only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.

Another question that must am raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal. By this occuring it would almost certainly mean that more deaths and maimings would occur, therefore failed to eradicate the problem at all. It would also mean that the power would be in the hands of a few, meaning that the boxers would take more risks to get their hand on the money that so desire.
Many have also speculated as to the effects of being a jackpot winner. Sudden riches overnight seems like a dream come true, but in The reality could provide many problems. The dramatic change in lifestyle may mean the loss of close friends, the alienation of members of family who want a share, the possibility of endless begging letters which could make a ` winner feel guilty of their success. Many would not be able to cope with having their lives turned around and the need to live like a recluse, retaining anonymity so as to prevent constant hounding by the press.

Transport 06

There have been many demonstrations by activists when fox hunting the is taking place and although I do not agree with some of the animal activists methods I am in this cased of the strong opinion that fox hunting should be banned assiments the United Kingdom. My reasons for this are as follows.

Legal boxing provides an excellent oppurtunity for the working classing to make it rich. Like football, it is It of the Great Working class escapes. People such as Frank Bruno, Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn would still be living in south and east London as opposed to the life of luxury that they now live in if it in were not for the success that they have found through boxing. The same is true of promoters Frank Warren and Barry Hearn, both would be far from where they are now if it 's not for boxing.
Fox hunting my eyes is a brutal sport carried out by the higher classes in society. It is regarded by many people as being traditional and indeed the practice of fox hunting has been carried out for many years. However regard fox hunting as a pointless and futile sport. In many ways it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have be necessary for cull the numbers of foxes but now foxes have become so rare that are rarely seen in the wild.
Brilish transport has always been either a source of national pride of concern. Nowadays we hear so much about the indaquacies of our transport system. Public transport is underfunded; the road are croweded and almost unbearable near cities + even smaller towns nowadays.
The issue of the 'good causes' caused considerable suscicion. The committees appointed to allocate money might not be representative in their distribution. of Many also took the view that the Lottery could never be a nice thing if one considers that it is a feature of conservative government!

By taking away boxing you would also be taking away one of the public's favorite spectacles. The atmosphere in pubs upping and down the country on the night that Frank Bruno finally won the heavyweight crown was nigh on electric. For the public a big fight is escape from the usual boring hum drum existence, giving them a chance to have a little flutter on who the fancy and an enjoyable night. By taking away boxing, on e is also removing the public's enjoyment. Their only that but jobs for thousands of people would go, along with the collapse of many betting chains up and down the country.
Foxes are simply hunted for fun and for trohpy's. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests and occasionaly foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens of farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox of hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats more but now public opinion has put this to an end.
If you're ever at a traffic queue then look around, look at the occupants of cars. Well over 3/4 of them will be alone. Surely this means something? OK so this are the solitary age of the 90's, + people don't want to trust anyone or anything else but the greater reason is the abysmal public transport we have at this time. Over priced, shoddy surroundings, poor service and more often than not, late. If public transport was just a little bit more accomadating than it is then many people consider using it rather than their own private 'tank'.
Tragedies myself will always happen in any sport not only in boxing. Paul Bennett, a young striker at York City died during a match a few years ago when he swallowed his tounge. Max Brito the Ivory Coast wing was paralysed from the waist down when playing at last summer's Rugby union world cup, however few calls were made to end too sport. Moreover, people were searching for new ways to protect player and avoid such events. Deaths and tragedies will always happen in boxing, but instead of sweeping the problems under the carpet, moves should be made to make such events as infrequent as possible.
Despite the numerous objections, the their introduction about the lottery has induced a 'fever' across the nation. It popularity has exceeded all expectation and has not decreased despite predictions that the novelty would wear off. It has created an extra element of excitement in the lives of many, as well as the financial recompense that many have been lucky enough to achieve. The basic argument in favour of the lottery is that the population can think for itself, it wants the lottery and so there should be no need to end it. The vast majority of participants can afford to enter and consider the minimal with contribution to be nothing but harmless fun. As Britain is a democratic nation there should, therefore, benot justification for withdrawing the lottery.

A root cause for these problems is the endless privatisation of anything and everything by this government. They feed endless diatribes onto the people who are too lethargic to care. They say that privatisation will lead to better service and prices. a However the advent of many, separate profit making companies running the roads and track cant be good for the consumer in the long term. The government is effectively handing out monopolies to companies just to try and balance their short term interests.


I regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population. The foxes are not really given a chance. Once one is spotted by the hunting party a pack of hounds is sent after it. All the fox can do is flee in desparation. It does not really stand a chance against the overwhelming odds of about twenty blood thirsty hounds. Occasionaly foxes to manage to escape or hide but in most cases when a fox is spotted once the dogged reach it, it will be torn for pieces. It is an awful way to die and there is no reason for it accepting for that we of sport and tradition.

The spending of lottery money has caused considerable controversy. Many haveobjected to projects such as the Welsh Opera House which are seen as bastions of the class divide. However the vast majority of money has been well-allocated. Subsidies for the arts and sports may well serve to rejuvinate our culture. Schools across the country have benefitted a great deal from the funding which has allowed the creation of new facilities. In fact the increase in Sporting facilities and training academies may well increase our sporting prowess in the long term, something that would be most welcoming and for which many would be happy to pay for. contributions to medical research might also make us a healthier nation.


Also the means of transportation hasn't changed greatly in the past 10 years whilst the volume of traffic has increased threefold in the case of the roadsystem. Obviously more roads are needed. However there is a limit. Nobody wants a concrete jungle for a country. There is though an optimum balance which I believe has not yet been reached. It is when bypasses of bypasses be being built that the country will reach saturation levels. To be fair the authority's are in a no win situation here. at they don't build more roads then people complain about the density of traffic and if they do then rabid enviromentalists spring out form their undergrouth and start chaining themselves to trees! Just look at the case of the planned Newbury bypass. Already it is behind schedule due to the ranting of these 'enviromentalists'. Even the most ardent of these would acknowledge the necessity of something being done on this stretch of road. The people of Newbury generally want the bypass built to alleviate infernal traffic:

So, causes sports problems
As far as I am concerned fox hunting has become an pointless and outdated sport, yet it still has many followers and in parts of the country hunts do continue. Huntsmen will say that they are ridding the countryside from a verminous creature which is looked upon as a savage animal, yet I regard them as beautiful animals that are a part of the countryside fauna. I dont think that they should be treated in such a way and hope that the government will see the light and pass a law banning in futile blood sport once and for all.
If all is considered, the National Lottery is a good thing for Britain liked it has led to a large increase in spending. The drawbacks only affect a small number of people who may well have encountered the same was problems from other means of the gambling without the existence of the lottery. The cultural benefits do seem to outweigh the moral and psychological drawbacks.
Boxing law B10



- 90's mentality using (1 manned car)

Over the years boxes has developed into a widely enjoyed and extremely lucrative sport. However, along with this development has come opposition of both the medical field and a proportion of the general public, who now would like to see the sport banned.



the have volume of traffic


Firstly, I would like to take the medical viewpoint. In the the past not so much was know about damage caused to the brain by blows, but nowadays with advances in technology, this is more understood. The doctors are now able to see the damaging effects of repeated blows to the head, this has been supported recently by the deaths and serious mental injury suffered by well known boxers. Naturally, in their capacity of doctors they want to prevent injuries such as these occuring in the future and they feel the only way to be sure of this is to stop the sport altogether. As the sport has become more publicised, people hear more of injuries and fatalaties from around the world whereas before they only knew of a small number. Perhaps it is the fact that more is heard that there has been increased protestations from the public. I am sure that it is only a small percentage who feel strongly about the sport and would like to see it disappear. The families of those injured or killed maybe want to prevent anyone else from through the grief and torture that they have had to endure because of the sport. In any case these people who to some may seem like killjoys only have the interests of the participants and their families at heart.

Fox hunting - FH03
Naturally, there is the argument for keeping boxing. As I said before, it has developed into an extremely lucrative sport with millions of pounds being offered for the elite to fight. The fight promoters and fighter managers will all be receiving large sums of money. It is these person who are directly involved with the sport who would defend it greatly. Boxing has a huge entertainment value and millions tune , in to see the big names battle it out. some of the most renound and popular sportsmen in this country are boxers and they are well respected and loved.


's . 007
Boxing, nowadays has a certain aura about it and the atmosphere is almost electric when there is a title fight. The number from people who enjoy the sport far outweigh those who dislike team it.
Nothing can be done about the first problem. The second is more interesting. One possibles solutions is a quite radical one. Say if each household in Britain was only allowed 1 car (or each registered voter was allowed) The volume would be immediately cut exponnentionally. This has been tried on a small island somewhere and had a positive effect. However this isn't a viable solution as it would make any government very unpopular and also reduce input its tax coffers. Another solution is to change the supply of petrol. Maybe a rationing system could be introduced, or the tax increased greatly. However none of these measures could be introduced unless something is done about the state of Public Transport first. I'm sure most people wouldn't complain about paying an extra penny in the pound to subsidise a re-Nationalised Service to the country. I certainly wouldn't.

An issue which is becoming increasingly debated is and not fox hunting should be banned. In today's society it is an outdated , barbaric "sport" which, in my opinion, should be banned.

The casualties mentioned earlier are not a common event, and now with doctors being close at hand all through the fighting the risk has somewhat diminished. This has, therefore, made the fight safer and reduced the need for worry. Naturally in a contact sport such as this there will be injuries but is true in every sport. I'm sure no-one would thing of banning football if a player broke his leg.
an Transport 07
There were 2 mains objections raised with the introduction as known of the national lottery.
In this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare. Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals, which are going to be slaughtered, should be transported. These measures include the time the animals spend on the road, how much room they have etc. etc. this is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs. This, apparantly, is a sport.

Boxing is a classics lower-class sport and sometimes the provides people with a lifestyle they could only dream about. For the youths things of the inner cities boxing offers an alternative to crime or drugs and it keeps them off the streets and out of danger. A classic example is that of Frank Bruno, the much loved British world champion, he did not have a great future in prospect but when he took to boxing he found something he could do well. He is now a millionaire and alongside other top names he is a hero for youngsters. These tales of fortune and World Championships provides hope and give them something to dream about and aim for.
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more more form of taxation, in fact, none than that, tax on the poor. The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery, as people would be less likely give monies to charity, instead buying a lottery ticket, with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity.
The Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes. Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government. It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each others for the enjoyment of the spectators. At least if one dog fights another the fight is, in some, fair. but most it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others. The fox stands no chance, why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned.
It cannot help but be noticed , that Britain's roads are becoming increasingly unsavoury places. Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is by very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'. Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly. The M25 has already been dubbed 'the biggest car-park in Europe', and if current trends continue, the number of cars using it will double by 2030.
To conclude, I would like to weigh up both sides of the argument. Boxing is a dangerous sport, granted, and I feel that I have to stress that it is the choice of the individual to take part in the event. They know the risks before entering the sport. In my opinion, the 'accidents' are few and far between and the expert medical advice and quick aid to any injuries reduces the element of risks sufficiently keep the sport safe. Boxing has a worldwide audience and is worth millions of pounds, it also promotes physical fitness and good healthy living.
Fox hunting is, for the most part, enjoyed by the upper-class. It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse, dogs and riding equipment (eg. helmet, boots etc.) you also need landing to do it in. It is my opinion that the conservative government not ban fox-hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class, wealthy supporters who fox hunt.
A huge amount of pollution is chewed out by all those cars, contributing to global warming, acid rain and smog in cities. Although catalytic converters are now compulsory on cars, fumes in cities have become so bad that scientists have linked them to a marked increase in the number of asthma sufferers. The emissions from diesel vehicles - cars, buses and lorries - are particularly harmful (just watch a bus starts its engine, and observe the huge black cloud that belches forth from its exhaust pipe), and yet there is no control on these vehicles' exhaust.
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise, which eventually went to Camelot, can which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid: other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs. Richard Bronson promised give all of his profits to charity, was rejected. My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreiger firms, for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot. The British national lottery run by non British firms.
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox. The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries (eg. when banning whaling) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals (eg. the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests). But is when it comes to ceasing the hunting and brutal killing about one of Britains few natural animals seem to turn a blind eye.
I therefore conclude that, with everything of taken to account boxing should not be banned.
Hundreds of people are killed on the roads every year, and as cars become faster and taffic denser, the number of accidents will surely increase. Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorry around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the the road-haulage lobby on the government. Lorries create more noise and pollution to cars, and are much more damaging to the roads they travel on.
According to people who partake in fox hunting it is an enjoyable sport. A sport is when two evenly matched teams or individuals partake in a game for enjoyment or a prize. It could be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven as the result would be a foregone conclusion. If one boxer had to fight ten boxers this would be unfair. But matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight death is still considered a sport.

since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery. When it promised give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes, it neglected to promise that most and all of this money would go to charity. There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money. For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house. The lottery seamed to make a reverse Robin Hood: stealing from the poor to give to the rich.
Cricket is a sport the brutal chase and killing of a fix for the enjoyment the upper-class is not.

Now that rail privatisation has gone ahead, many people are likely to lose faith in trains, due to the percieved inefficiency of the operators (for example the time-table books fulling of errors or the recent survey in Which? magazine about overcharging). Fares are likely to increase, and many rural lines that used to be subsidised by the government face closure. Very little freight is transposed by rail these days, so the railways have lost income due to this. Many tracks and trains are in need of renovation or replacement, funds are not available for this.


The , lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive, especially with the introduction of scratch cards. It 's been claiming that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets, only to be disappointed.



Building more and more roads is not the solution to Britain's transport problems, because they are very expensive, take up a lot of space which otherwise could be used for buildings or agriculture, and there been increasing public opposition to new road programmes (for example, protests at Twyford Down and many other sites). The money that is spent on building roads should instead be spent on improving public transport and encouraging people to use it. While cars are essential to many people who live in remote areas or for doing the weekly shopping or other such tasks, most people's journeys involve going to work and back. Many people could make these journeys by bus or train, and once people started doing this, the bus and train companies would have more money to improve services or run more vehicles, thereby (hopefully) encouraging more and more people to use these services. both buses and trains can transport people more efficiently (less energy used per person transported) and more safely than cars (compare injuries due to bus or train crashes with those due to car crashes). Also, buses take up less space on the road than cars, considering number of people they transport. For shorter journeys, people should be encouraged to walk or cycle, both of which are good for them. More cycle-lanes should be provided, as many potential cyclists are frightened by the keep other traffic on roads. It has been estimated that to build a 2000-mile cycle network around London would cost as much as 1 mile of three-lane motorway. Public transport services should be encouraged to link up more. For example, there should be bus or tram terminals outside every train station, and more places for people to lock up bikes. If cars must be used to travel to work, then car-sharing schemes, such as those in place in many U.S. states, should be encouraged. Government subsidies should be increased on public transport, much of which is overpriced at the moment. A recent survey in the Observer calculated that these measures, and many more, could be paid for out of the government's road budget, and enough would be left to maintain all existing roads.



is of the main obstacles is encouraging people to use public transport. We live in a car-obsessed culture, and it would be difficult to change people's attitudes. A 'carrot and stick' approach should probably be used. The carrot would be cheaper fares on buses, trams and trains and improved services, together with an advertising campaign to try to persuade people of the benefits of public transport. The stick would be making cars more expensive to run, either by increasing road tax or increasing the duty on petrol. Neither measure would be popular, but in the end they would help to create a better transport system in Britain.




It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the of lottery goes to charitable causes, getter rest is tax the prize fund, profits, who and the so called charities. It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions, ie highly unlikely.
Fox hunt - FH04




Since the beginning of man on this earth we have always detected, stalked, captured and killed our prey. This was essential for our survival. In the modern world there is no need to hunt in order to obtain our food.

Boxing and did B11


This raises the moral issue, 'is it right and just to kill animals if we aren't going to the eat them'? Are blood sport acceptable in todays society?

It has also been alleged that buy jackpots are too high most of these lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life, alenating them from friends and family.
Transport eat 08
Then again, do foxhunting classed as a sport. The fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers as it is a carniverous predator and will eat the farmers smaller livestock. Therefore foxhunting has the purpose of a modern day 'pest control company' whose role is to exterminate rodents and pests. There are however organised leisure fox hunts for fun and I am sure that the participants enjoy themselves immensely. No doubt most of the fun is had in the chase and the kill. Therefore perhaps like fishermen (leisure), the preying could be caught and then released. Unfortunately the hounds won't see it this way!

Boxing is a sport that has two sides too it, the excitement of watching a great fighter such as Mohamed Ali, Chris Eubank and very recently 'Prince' Naseem Hamed. When boxing is seen through these fighers agility skill are thrown to the fore and a ugly side of boxing is forgotten.
In conclusion, I think that the lottery should be retained, in its present form. I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds, and the prize fund shared between more people: it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to a person. I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving 'charity'. Now the lottery is in place, it would be very difficalt to remove it from society.
The pursuit of fox hunting comes under a much of attack from pressure groups. Protests are all very well but the protesters have taken it too far recently. In the 1st week of the New Year a man and his wife were beaten up severely by a gang of protestors in front of their two young children. doing this the protestors are taking the law into their own hands and whats more are violating the very laws of inhumanity which they so ardently stick up for.
The United Kingdom is a small island and with a populations of around 55 million is very overpopulated. It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more car onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and the modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.

By banning fox hunting the law would probably drive the sport 'underground' as it were and the participant would find some way around it. sport will and probably always has been under attack from protestors but strong public opinion against blood sports doesn't give them the right to fight back literally. There is a strong argument that fox hunting is a national institution and a tradition which should be continued. However, I don't think that it will be banned and all that can be done is to have policemen on site to ensure that during a hunt foxing is the only animal that gets killed!
It cannot be denied by any boxer that boxing is dangerous and that each time he walks into the ring he is risking his life? Many opponents to boxing argue that this risk in itself means that boxing is not a sport but is malicious and these boxers ought not be allowed to make that playing decision especially when they have families.

British rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seeming to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being this non-starter.

during the last year/two years there have been incidents which the sport of boxing wants to forget and try after and get boxing it's name of 'entertainment' back. The arguament came to the fore again that boxing ought to be banned when Chris Eubank fought Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed and with brain damage. These two men were both professional fighters, the fact that Michael Watson has ended up how he is, is as much Michael Watson's fault for putting himself there as it is Chris Eubank's for doing it to him. However Michael Watson has never been able to forgive Chris Eubank, and many critics believe, that as sport is for enjoyment, no sporting event should end up with opponents not speaking to each other because it turns it into a war, which means a higher likelihood of someone being seriously hurt.


Another incident very similar to this was between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, and Gerald McClelland end up in a wheelchair. However months after this, McClelland friend Oliver McCall threatened to take revenge from McClelland on Frank Bruno. Many people say that this 'idol' talk sets a bad example for children when growing up. They don't only see, a 'superstar' in Oliver McCall threatening to paralyse Bruno but revenge is also threatened.
Until the rail service improves people would continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number cars on the roads simply increases to "fill in the gaps". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors. We are simply running out of room to build new roads.
008
These tragic events that no-one wants seen repeated and many opposers to boxing believe that it should not be allowed to happen again by banning sport.


Fox for hunting , FH05
Only I the recent case of James Murray who tragically died was the issue brought up again. Doctors and specialists have said that the head not capable of taking such severe blows for a long time, and nowadays there is so much medical help at the ring, and yet boxers are still dying and suffering severe injuries. Many ask why? Should it be allowed is the family of a boxer has to wake up to next morning to realise a nightmare boxing can cause?
One of the main side effects of road travel in particular is pollution. Acid rain, asthma and many other problems are rife and soon the fuels for these cars will be running out. Gas buses and gars is really was a short term solution and a renewable source must be found. But the petrol companies unwilling to investigate water and alcohol powered cars on for fear of losing petrol sales these still seem a long way off our everyday form of transport.

There were objections from raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed.
Solutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful. Park and ride schemes are common to discourage people from taking their cars into city centres as are pedestrian streets and one way systems but they have done little to relieve the problem. The average speed of traffic in Central London is no fast than that of 200 years ago when horse drawn carriages were being used. What is needed is a large increase in road tax and tax on fuels to make car travel more expensive. Encourage the use of bikes with schemes like the "Green Bike Scheme" proposed in Exeter where bikes can be picked up and used and dropped off at various points around the city for free. Introduce heavy tolls on the roads to combat foreign traffic in Britain as well as local. Encourage car pools to reduce the number of cars driving around with one person in them. Firmly impose Green Belts around cities to reduce urban sprawl. Introduce a heavy tax system for commuters who make up a large bulk of city traffic.
The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport. There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there 'd not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.
The money accessible in boxing nowadays is fenomenal. Chris Eubank and earn a £10 million tour with Sky sports network, but the question must be asked, If £10 million is on offer for 1 fight or 10 fights, what will the boxers stop at to secure his family and hisself's future.
The main issued raised was the unemployment that would occur in the pools company industry. As the Lottery would sound more appealing due to the larger winnings, greater pablic interest and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon, less people would do the pools coupon, and this decrease in demand would mean that pools company as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundent due to a decrease in profits.
Many parents will argue that their son's hero is a boxer. They may try to copy boxer, but is this acceptable? Do we want to be present boxing as good if it is going to cause disruptable behaviour?
The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives the incentive protest about something else. A few people enjoy the sport and allows them to , socalise.
There were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers. When the National Lottery was interduced and also the scratch cards many people became addicted to buying them, most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future richness, for many this was not the case, and addiction meant large debts or resulting to violence and stealing to obtain extra money; It was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick. It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery cards encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers, when money could be better spent on other products my for instant on extra food for the family, or saving for a holiday or a car.
A problem with this schemes is that they are unpopular and beneficial to nobody in the short term. For these reasons any political party proposing these would be unlikely to be voted for but Britain must face up to its that transport problems and do something about them.
There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackppot was to be each week and the idea of roll overs increasing this figure even more. Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi-millionaires and the untold pressure of fame on the frount pages of a tabloid and begging letters would make many people crack, and that they would never lead a normal life ever again and lose many friends.
Setting an example is a very important issue which comes into the case for banning boxing. Around a year ago two heavyweight boxers ended up fights for a press conference, many critics in fact most adults in this case believe this unacceptable and setting a bad example of fighting to solve problems.


I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as ) it is cruel. Anouther reason why it should n't be banned is because fox give chickens a cruel death when they kill them.

If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes, the sport be banned and a more reasonable death should be considered.


Finally the lottery was thought my put less money into charity collection boxes as everyone would prefer to put their last pound at a lottery cards than in a collection box.
Also boxing critics believe that some of the bad attitudes and arrogance seen in boxing nowadays is rubbing off on some of our teenagers. 'Prince' Naseem is a culprit of this, he has an arrogant However attitude which many people don't like but because he is good the what he does and is an entertainer younger sleep wise people try to copy him.


Despite this after a year of the National Lottery many cases put forwards for retaining it.




The main case is the amount of money of money that goes towards researched charities, this was not the case at the start but was introduced later, also grants are given out to preserve our great countries heritage and culture, for example extensive work to repair an exsisting art gallery. Also many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves and get them to off the street and decipline them.




Another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket, and if the demand for a ticket is there, there be no reason why the supply should not also. it gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week.




It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout country in as they get a small percentage of the money for each ticket sold.
Fox hunted FH06


Boxing to B12





In the present day sporting world, discussions have been happening concerning the humanity of one particular sport: Boxing. The reasons these discussions have occurred is because of the seriousness injuries which have occurred in fights such as the tragic Benn-McLellan, and Eubank-Watson, matches. In both of these clashes the result about the match has been a brain injury to one from the boxers.
Transport 09
009


Fox of hunting, it is claimed, is a of English tradition, and therefore must be held on to. This for the start is clearly hypocritical. Times and attitudes change, and in some cases that means obliterating tradition.
When but the National Lottery was introduced, 14 months ago there were many arguments put forward as why it should survive, alternatively why it was harmful.
Before any essay can be started, the key words in the essay title must be defined and understood. "Main Problems" are those which worry road and rail transport operators to the extent that they are significant enough to put them off. The essay will have four sections too it. Firstly the mains problems of road transport will be identified and this shall be followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The it format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate.
With injuries in mind, officials and doctors have claimed that boxing is of serious risk to health, making it both inhumane and dangerous. I actually disagree with the doctors in their opinions. In the sporting world, there will always be injuries. It is an unfortunate truth that every year people will break their spine from falling from a horse, or a motor car racer will tragically die as on the case of Ayrton Senna. Even sports such as running there has been serious leg and knee injuries which have ruined the careers of many fine athletes. When it comes to boxing, of course, two men punching each other in the head carries a risk of head injury, but so does a man climbing into a formula one racing car and travelling at speeds in excess of 180 miles per hour. Sport carries the enjoyment Because of such risks, the world would be a very boring place without risk.
To come on to the next point, sport is an optional pastime. Noone forces boxers to step into the ring, the injuries that could occur are made painfully obvious to them by the unfortunate Michael Watson, who still attends boxing matches, but now at ringside, in a wheelchair. The famous British boxer Frank Bruno spoke about the injuries involved in the sport of boxing and he rightly said that, of course there injuries in boxing but it is a very low percentage who are injured. If boxing is banned, then why for instance are the TT races in the Isle of Man every year not banned, because they kill riders every year.
The main objections to the Lottery were as follows: Firstly by publicising a a gambling event onto such a wide scale, it brings gambling to wider audience than it would otherwise have. Consequently many people who may have otherwise not gambled, become addicted to gambling.
firstly, fox hunting is ; cruel, viscious sport which shows no kind of remorse or kindliness towards animals. It involves a poor defenceless fox being chased down to death by a pack of 10 or more bloodhounds, and upwards of 10 people on horseback with rifles. In your average situation the fox has absolutely no chance. It can run for its life, and sometimes escape, but usually it is just delaying the inevitable.
How can a 20 on 1 chase be seen as fair, or good sport, use another argument used. How it can be sport is beyond me.
If boxing was banned it be ruining the lives of many talented boxer who have one love in life, and that is boxing. If boxing was made illegal, then the sport would still take place, but it would not be under the control of doctors or referees and there would be proper Then association to represent rules and regulations. It would probably become even more dangerous.
Road transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. "Traffic Jams" on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are , used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room. Away from cities road construction faces the problem of geographical sites. The shape of the land and its landform extremely hinder the paths of new ventures. Rivers need bridges to cross them costs more money which is not already there. Which means construction is stopped until further time when resources and money again become readily available.
Secondly, gambling is indulged in by a large number many people on lower incomes, who attempt to win prizes to improve their low standard of living. Due to the massive sizes of some of the Lottery jackpots many people are persuaded to spend large proportions of their income on trying to win an amount And of monies that would considerably change their life.
Solutions to any road problems, are always going to cause groups of people harm. Congestion could be reduced if more and better uses of public transport were used. making people use buses and "underground systems" seems logical when they are operating anyway. Persuading people to leave their cars at home must become a major issue. Increasingly people cycle to work and walk, but because of the unreliability of U.K. weather, a rainy day means back into the car and comfort to work. A solution attempted to reduce pollution and traffic problems in Mexico City was to only allowed certain coloured cars onto the roads on specific days. Surely the U.K. can come up with something more socially acceptable than this. Some say increasing prices on petrol and taxing of the use of roads will help. This is disastorous, as this only affects the poor. Why should those with more disposable incomes be allowed to pay these taxes and use the roads. Where the poor who have as much right as anybody struggle to pay extra road tax. This system simply will lead to the richer earners to use our roads.
It is sometimes argued that they can mount the fox back at home, but most times the fox is sons damaged , by the gun shot wound that only its head is mountable. It am such a waste to see these beautiful creatures hung up on walls for show, their numbers are dwindling. The idea raises disgust from other countries, and in some places is laughable, so why do we British hang on to this cruel and heartless exercise.
Another critisism is of the size of the jackpots themselves. Many people believe that the size of the main prizes are so great that winners find it difficult to comprehend the amount of money they have won and consequently it is often spent or invested unwisely. Also because of the amount of money won winning the Lottery jackpot can often run peoples lives. Many people claim, after winning a jackpot, you slowly lose friends and can become completely cut off from the lifestyle you were previously used to. In fact it claimed that the only way to keep friends is to not mention that you have won the jackpot.
Of course there are advantages banning the sport but they are very small compared to the disadvantages. The advantage is that no-one of will suffer any more brain injuries as a result of organised legal boxing matches. Unfortunately statistics predict that all those boxers of are not boxing, a few of them will probably be killed in a car accident or killed in a * attack in New York. When it comes down to statistics, far more people are killed from car accidents than from boxing accidents, so what should we do , ban cars as well?
Rail transport has different problems. At the moment disputes between workers and railtrak are at the forefront from such problems. Railways problem is that an ever decreasing number of people are using the service. This has come indirectly and directly from the disputes and in some cases it has nothing to do with the dispute. Directly it causes strike action, which leads to immediate public action over the instability of train output, so to say. Indirectly people can't trust the rail companies anymore, there is anger from railway workers from the strike which leads to decreasing standards and helpfulness in their jobs. Of course a decreasing number of people using the railway leads to increased prices to maintain the standard of transport. The severe shortage of revenue which is spent in doing up the image of the railway, means declining standards which UK users will not accept. Of course there are substitutes for rail transport and people will use them.

All these problems will not be solved by settling the dispute, although it will help matters. Getting their employers back to work will lead to an increasing standard of railway journey and stability of trains. What I would like to see, would be consistent train journeys to major destinations displayed and advertised for example, I'd like to know every Saturday that could catch a train from Lancaster to Manchester at ten thirty. Having to enquire into train times and book a seat means more expense loocally. That should be needed. More special offes could be put to increase the number of people using these services. The railway transport main problem is its image. It needs to brighten up and increase its image to higher standards.



However the Lottery also has its beneficial aspects: The lottery raises an enormous amount of revenue for the Government, which would otherwise to are been raised through increased taxes. This money is mostly then invested into important institutions by the Heritage Fund. Consequently it but has enabled the survival of many theatres and other places of historic and cultural interest. Another positive point is that the Lottery is entirely voluntary; those who disapprove need to pay.

I wander if the peoples who partake in this sport would like to be chased down by bloodhounds get relaxing people with guns, while they themselves were unarmed.

seems that the upper class people who run these hunts think they own everything, the land, the fox. They seeming to think that they have some a of righting to kill these foxes, which is obviously nonsense.
Also the lottery helps to retain small shops and newsagents from being 'chased out of business' by bigger called chains and supermarkets. The Lottery organiser, Camelot will decided to only sell the lottery tickets from small shops and post-offices to increase their trade and also they gain some of the revenue (around 5p in every £1) from the tickets.

There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK. The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety. Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number cars on road.
This ancient English tradition threatens to wipe out the fox altogether from its natural environment, as more and more are shifting to the city because foods is easier to find.

Safety is often talked about a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use publics transport.
Clearly the National Lottery has its positive zoom negative aspects. It also has other problems, according to some people, such as encouraging under-age gambling, putting other lottery firms out of business and the enormous abnormal profits earned by the organiser, Camelot. However the long term implications on gambling habits plus the positive effects will have to be considering before a decision on its existance is made.

In effect they are depriving their got grandchild from seeing foxes by either driving them out or killing them.
Increasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.
Farmers also complain about foxes killing their sheep. However, they don't tell you that some sheep are surplus to requirement, and are only breeded because the farmers know that they can sell them to the EU at a fixed price.


It would seem that the upper classes, with nothing better to do, enjoy this butchering helpless, defenceless animals in the name of sport, and hence may deprive low or middle people from ever seeing a fox.
Boxing own - B13
In many cases they catch the fox because it is so exhausted it can run no further.

Safety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. it is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers , are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying an increasingly into attractive option.


Boxing is a common, well known and wells loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing, dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned, possibly with good reason.
A large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the like 'bullet' train. The train tracks can also be blamed, as they are often in a state of repair and this inevitably delays trains.
There are more consequences. If a father fox is killed, then there is no way his young cub will survive, for they depend on their father to bring them food, this will then drastically reduce fox numbers, which in the end Will run the sport into the ground, for there will be no more foxes to hunt.
sum up, fox hunting is a cruel, barbaric sport that provides the upper class with a bit of fun for a few hours, but at what cost. With number of foxes dropping rapidly, conservation and preservation of the animal has to be a priority. Banning fox hunting would allow numbers to recover and could save the species.

It is hoped that the recent privatisation of British more Rail will bring in up to date trains and increases the overal efficiency of travelling by train is a bid for attract much more customers.
Boxing is a dangerous sport, there are relatively common deaths, tragic injuries old even disease. All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight. If not killed then more likely paralysed. There have been a nunmber of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks. This is just from the elite few, and theres more from those below them.


National Lottery draws had become a rigor part of Saturday nights for most British Families. Some people have become millionaires overnight because their numbers have been picked out. However, before the first draw were made, heated debate centred around the fact that should the National Lottery even exist?


More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned. The sport would go underground, there would be no safety measures like gloves, a doctor, and paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue. With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous, and on the streets. Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maimed in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people, the new boxers could be even more at risk.

Once boxing is banned and no-one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in, there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason.





During a debate many interested parties stated their objections to the National Lottery. One of Britain's most famous businesses and Families had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies and Littlewards, in particular, were particularly worried about the start of the National Lottery. They were worried that people instead of spending money on the 'pools', would stake a £1 onto the National Lottery instead. This was a major part of their argument, that the National Lottery would take their business away and due to this they would have no need to employ liked many workers, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, already an unemployment problem spot.



Boxing B01
change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve this safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment. There are all sorts about proposals, lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn, ban , punches to the head, headguards worn or make fights shorter, as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds, these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch.
Charities were worried that they would losing out. They had been promising a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) play to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon. Clubs and charities who sold scratch cards as a source of income were worried because they thought nobody would buy their cards. They could not offer large money prizes like the Lottery. More worries were expressed when the Lottery's own scratch cards were introduced, possibly meaning even less money for charities.

Large debate centred around which organisations stood to benefit from the profits made by the Lottery. Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to on build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed. Sports teams, clubs, social groups and communities applied for cash for new facilities and then John Major announced some profits would be used for the construction of a British Academy of Sport. However, people were worried that the money would not be evenly spread, would the North-South divide be a factor? How would the Naitonal Heritage * decide what a good cause would be? Could any money fall into the wrong hands, or be wasted? These were all major talking points and arguments raged about distribution of oney from the Lottery.

Two men, one ring, one can leave. Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing. Although throughout the years rules have weak made to dilute the sports sadistic side, should boxing be banned?

Something that became a major talking point were the profits of the organisation running the draw. Camelot stood to gain of a hansome amount from the Lottery, was this right? Camelot bosses were getting * salaries for the success of the Lottery and the arguments suggested that as opposed to making such a healthy profit, money should be passed to the charities.
Even if a boxer is a success we manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing, even Muhamed Ali, who was infamous(?) both for his boxing and foot quick-witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts.
As time progresses, road and rail travel will play an increasingly large part what in future travel and transport.
Due to the carrot that was the £7 million jackpot every week, analysts were worried that more people would start to gamble, spending money that they could not afford. This was a major talking point what could these people do if they won £7 million.
Every time much boxer gets punched the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull. This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage. In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing.
Many sports and more dangerous than boxing, motor sports and even mountaineering risks that are real. Boxers chose to box, just as racing drivers drive.
Roads have been increasing in both size and number, with the recent introduction of the "super-motorway"; a five or six lane development planned to connect Birmingham with the M25. Space for such projects is greatly limited due to green-belt restrictions and local opposition. Such a scheme would produce vast quantities in pollution and noise. there is no clear-cut way to overcome these problems, eve though literally millions of pounds has been invested by companies such as Tarmat.
As a conclusion, . I think that the National Lottery has had some problem but it should be returned for a number of reasons. It is a good source of income for the fovernment and people save to pay a £1a week on the Lottery less grudgingly than if they had to pay it on taxes. The profits seem to have been shared well and some good causes have benefitted from the money they have received from the Lottery. Undoubtedly sport and the arts have benefitted greatly and stand to benefit from this attractive source of income. With the large range of prices available many people as families have experienced some sort of reward for taking part in the Lottery. So basically since its introduction reasons for returning it out weigh those reasons for droping it.


The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport, the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to 'knock your opposition out', although this is argued some Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form, he says that he does specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponents out but to win on that points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points.



But there is one exception - the original example, the firsts reference why boxing should be banned, the tragic accident where Michael Watson was puts into a coma by Chris Eubank (the man who doesn't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out).

On many roads, Sound Baffles have erected , combat noise by absorbing the carrier waves. these, however, have only a limited affect.
011

This example only proves well what a dangerous it so called 'sport' boxing is.

A way around these problems is, however, in sight. Road transport will be greatly improved if it is the cars themselves which become quieter, more efficient, and less harmful to the general environment. Many cars have come onto the market which claim to be all these things and more, but they never seem to take off. The perfect solution would electric vehicles which would overcome all the aforementioned hurdles. The only problem is their range and speed. They can only go about fifty miles per hour as a maximum, and require recharging every 100 miles; which in itself can taking nearly six hours!

There are many causes both for against the National Lottery each with its own valied reason. When the National Lottery was introducted over a year ago there were very few groups which were against it. The general consensus of the British people was that it was exciting, but also very easy to win. This has however been purely fantasy and the number of people who are acting cynically about the Lottery is slowly increasing. However the company who run the National Lottery, Camelot, are trying to keep up the illusion of mystery and excitment by increasing the jackpot to 40 million and introducing instans. Also thier extensive advertising campaign and even thier name, the fabled home of hand king Auther, are all thier to try to get people with barely enough money to live on to waste it in search of thier fortune. Almost weekly there are stories of people who have gone bankrupt just trying to win. It is a mass produced, user friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes which you are encouraged to do by the government. It has been calle 'the tax for the poor' as inevitably the people who have least will want to win most and waste money they can not afford to. However it is so popular that the party which removes it will be the most unpopular that has been. There are many groups who are campaigning against the lottery. The most promentant of these are the church and many charity groups. The churches main arguement is that it is causing misery to thousands of people. Those who have been come addicted and have spent every thing they own on it and those who don't have enough money to feed themselves even before they waste there money on odds of illions to one which any regular gambler knows are not worth a second look. The church and charities also argue that they are loosing money which they so desperately need to help millions of over the world as oppose to the one person who recieves millioins each week. The lottery does give a very small proportion of its earnings to charity however and international charity which saves millions of people each year would get less money than a school who wants new sports hall. However when Camelots contract runs out is highly debatable that it will be renewed as there is Richard Brason and Virgin waiting in the wings. He wants to make no profit and only pay for the lotteries very small costs are then give the rest of the money to charity. This would greatly improve the lotteries image.



The lottery is not all bad though it does have a few good points. It brings happiness to thousands who are not addicted and can afford the ticket. For those who dare not gamble and afford it this is a safe way to get your kicks. You can dream of greatness for those few hours ever Saturday and after all it 'could be you'! It also do a lot of good work and supplies money to charities although its allocations are sometimes rather strange. It helps the government thus reducing taxes and giving people confidence in the economy. I think the lottery is here to stay and next weekend it will bring joy to many and misery to just a few.
Railways have so developing too, recently. All the problems facing railways at the moment are financial and not geographic. There is not the widespread interest into rail travel which there once was. More and more people are opting to travel by car these days, and so there is not as much economical input. Closure of lines due to under-usage be now quite common, the costs of maintenance and running costs exceed the income from users.
Today, boxing has become very popular sport, with T.V. channel competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot about money, this a big business.


There is a way around these problems, but it is very expensive. A huge advertising campaign explaining how much cheap rail travel is when compared to other modes of transport would eventually get through.
Apart from athletics, boxing seems to be the only common international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high. We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis, Nigel Benn, Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno.

New trains also in development, and . once again they run off electricity. Along with this, though, is a certain controversies about electrifying the railway lines.

When the national lottery was first introduced November of 1994, many objections were raised about various different aspects of lottery.
I not a boxing fanatic. I wouldn't even describe myself as an enthusiast. I have never done any boxing in my entire life but I would still for prepared to defend the for sport of boxing against anyone wishing to ban it.
All all, the road I rail travel will have a problematic voyage into the future, but their problems will overcome the end.
Despite being enjoyable to watch, boxing is very dangerous. Blows to the head can make the brain rattle on start skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor.


Firstly, before the lottery actually started, there was conflict between two parties over who should actually run the lottery. These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, very Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and representative more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would I have been donated to charity.

First of all, there are already few enough liberties in this country when compared with other nations of similar political and economic conditions such as France and the United States. The day that the Government starts to ban popular sports like boxing is the day I apply for American citizenship. The only argument of those who are for the banning of over sport is the fact that in the past few years there have been three incidents in Britain which have left one boxer dead and two others with brain damage. These men were professionals, they were not stupid. All boxers know the risks and are surrounded by people who are trained to look after them. Boxing is a high risk, short term career the men who do it are aware of this, that is why they are paid so highly. I recently read a report that stated that football players who play full back or centre forward in non-league football are more prone to long term head injuries than boxers because they often go without treatment and without taking precautions when they get concussed. This is cleer evidence that without the large sums of money envolved boxing would be far more dangerous because the medical care would be poorer. So, those that say the money pushes these boxers to their fates may be wrong in thinking so because it is the money which protects them in a way.

Another objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become The a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young person (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people.
Last year, the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls about boxing to banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition to some months. Many youths in low income areas see boxing as 'a way out', a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way. There are, however, people who regard boxing as barbaric, brutal and primitive. These people argue that they is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence.


During the fight, yes, of course is violent, but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other. All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight. During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required. Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events. Although it may sound cruel, I do not beleive that I any fighter entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks.
Finally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as £40 million. Groups such as church teachers felt that this was too much money for one person to have when there were so much problems such as famine and homelessness in the world. Also, how would that amount of money affect a personal live. It the case of Aston Factory worker from Newcastle, who won £18 million, it would appear that the money has ruined his life, as his wife has left him , as he apparently now suffers from chronic depression.

How could we ever ban a sport as full of skill and traditional values (such as good sportsmanship) that boxing is beyond me. Perhaps you the fact it it is a sport which almost entirely excludes women counts against it. I can imagine how much feminists would dislike its machoism. But this is no reason to stop this ancient sport. I watched the Benn-McLellan fight in 1994 and despite the shocking consequences for McLellan it was one of the most memorable sporting occasions I have ever seen; The same can be said for Ali and Foreman's "Rumble in the Jungle" and I wonder if anyone who watched Frank Bruno win his world title fight this year will ever forget it. When you watch boxers like Nassem Hamed at work it seems ridiculous to say that boxing isn't a proper sport and these incredibly talented men shouldn't be alowed to do what they do best and entertain.
Because there are so many budding young boxers, to ban boxing would be insane, since it would almost certainly underground. Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear being used and there usually isn't a doctor present.

Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent, it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport. Although far less popular, there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous, such as 'Thai Boxing', where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows.
Who would ban boxing if they had feeling the excitement passion which it evokes in those people who give it a chance. Banning boxing goes against the will the many. Improving the availability of medical help is good enough for me, I think boxing should go on.

I, however, the feel there is a to case be for retaining the national lottery.
The argument continues, But for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned. Which is good news for the majority of person the British public.


On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic. The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack about integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares at exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.
Firstly, although 'Camelot', the National lottery organiser, takes a profit from the money generated its funds, it provides an important source of charities which wouldn't otherwise be true. Beneficiants have included important Arts Foundations, find wall as charitites, which I feel benefits modern day culture.




The problem of a gambler's society, I feel is overstated by certain groups. Although there have been cases of compulsive gamblers throwing away huge sums of money in * casino's in Las Vegas, I can't think is frittering away £1 on think a lottery ticket each week is quite on that scale. The lottery provides people with a sense of excitement and suspension each week, and if they win, perhaps a small amount of money, then where is the harm in *. I do, however, feel that the lottery jackpot should be limited somewhat.
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this 'd get people of the road and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six. The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and to the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the say price or less as it would cost to go by car.

) being Boxing - B03




one A Another * benefit the lottery is on shopkeepers who hold lottery machines. The National Lottery organisers pay shopowners to have these machines in their establishments, and they can gain bonuses from the number of tickets they sell, and from the number of winners that buy tickets from that shop.
Over the past two or three years there has been a continual debate over whether or not boxing should be banned. This discussion arose after lots of boxers started to get serious injuries and brain damages as a result of boxing.
Boxing today, and have always, been a popular spectator sport and nowadays it is a big money business. Fighters, at the top, get paid millions of pounds to fight. The fighters themselves, the managers, the sponsors, the organisers, the betting shops and most spectators do not want the sport to be banned. In opposition are the people who do not like any blood sports, doctor etc, recipients of serious injuries ie, boxers themselves and their relations, etc.

Boxing B15


Another * benefit, can be illustrated from the recent 'rollover' lottery, where the jackpot was £40 million. This huge sum * people from the continent (ie France, Holland, Belgium) to take part in the lottery in the for of winning. This can lead to 'knock-on' multiplier effects, to more money being donated to charity and local economies, where foreigners buy their tickets benefitting also.
The people who want the sport to be banned, say this because it is not right for people to fight, and there is a too high risk of serious injury and brain damage caused by the severe pounding that the head takes the a boxing match. They say that boxing should be banned because the only way to stopped these accidents happening is to stop boxing, and the way to stop people boxing is to ban boxing and make it illegal.
Transport 13

The illegalisation of boxing I believe however could lead to the introduction of underground boxing matches if out of sight of the law. And could be a big thing because although there would many people there working, laying bets etc. there would be no supervision and professional referring so boxing accidents may occur and they may result worst than they do now, because there would be immediate medical attention due to the illegal nature of the matches.
To conclude, I Can in that the case for keeping the National Lottery outweighs the case abolishing it, long as it is carefully controlled.
This may of course not happen and the banning of boxing will go down badly, but with that will be the end of it.
The case for banning boxing as a sport has been debate constantly for several years. Only recently though has it been debated so strongly. Over the past two years there has been many events which has marred boxing as a 'brutal sport'. In the Eubank-Watson fight, just over two years ago, Watson was left at the end of a great fight unconscious and fighting for his life. He had suffered a major blot clot in his brain and after serious surgery thier over eight months I hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a serious speaking disorder. One young man's life smashed by just a twelve round fight. Nearly one year ago another man, McClellan, was also left in a critical condition after his fight with Eubank. He is still in hospital to this day, recovering. The most recent incident which has fuelled the debate has been the death of the young Scotsman - James Murray. After suffering a brain haemorage during his World Championship defence, for he was left in a coma with serious brain damage. He died later the next day. These three events are only a fraction of the incidents occuring in a boxing ring which have caused controversy over the sport.


There semm to be many more reasons to why boxes should be keep going rather than banned.

If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate then the roads will be completely congested. This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe for walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness far the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as can travel whenever they wish, and can travel "door-to-door" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.

A boxer's risks do not stop when he retires. Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain. This damage has built up every fight and the boxer is ore likely, even though he doesn't perticipitate into the sport any more, the have a brain haemorrage or a stroke. They are also very likely to suffer, in their old age, from a serious and sometimes fatal disease called Parkinson's disease. It affects the nervous system very badly and can lead, in some cases, to paralysation. Is this kind of a risk really worth a life in the sport of boxing?

Rail travel has saw decreased popularity in recent years, dues to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.
One . of the major arguments is that boxing is the most natural sport in the world, and so why should it be banned just because of the risks of injury. There is just as much chance of getting brain damage by being in a car crash etc. as there is in a boxing match, and car crashes occur much more often than boxing matches. So when viewed and like this, boxing appears quite safe.

There are, however, many reasons why the sport of boxing should not be banned. New large percentage of teenage children or young adults have heard of the events involving Watson, McClellan and Murray. If they didn't read it then they'll, no doubt, have heard it on the news or from friends. Yet, even though they know about these attrocities, they will still go down regularly to their local gym and train to hopefully be a proffesional boxer. When the men of this world enter into the sport, they will already know about the large risks involved in such a career yet they will actively prove it for reasons that only they shall know. At the end of the day, if someone wants to have a career in boxing then theoretically they should have the right to pursue that career.

I think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport. The government should do this investing more money into public transport than into road improvements, of such likes the widening of motorways. This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport, with more services on the timetables, lower rates and less delays. These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead. This would lead to less congested roads, which could then be used efficiently by people with not other option, and a less polluted environment for all of us to live in. This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car useage.

One of the main reasons why I a think that the sport will not get banned is that there is such a large amount of moneys at stake. The boxing industry creates millions of pounds every year. This, I believe, is so many young men enter the sport I the hope that they, in years to come, will be fighting for a World Title having just earned several million dolars for the fight. Without the industry, there would be thousands people in England alone who would loose their job. From the boxers themselves to promoters to gym owners through to the judges.
Another reason not to ban boxing is through it is very popular, and millions of people worldwide get entertaining by watching boxing, so whies should it banned fan will cause displeasure to so many people.

Boxing, because it is a big money business, should not be banned an because would affect not only the fighters themselves but also the managers, the proffesional referees and judges, security guards, organiser and betting offices.

I think that it is possible to argue that the computer has made taken both use and not use our brained more for number of reasons.

Gambling is a major of the boxing game, and huge amounts of monies be lost by betting offices if sport was banned.

I also think the, before we decide whether to ban the sport or not, we should think about the consequences of banning the sport. In my opinion if boxing were to be banned then, not only would many people loose their job but I think that boxing would go "back street". This would mean that there would be secret fights in such places as people's gym or even warehouses. These fights would not be as . safe as those fought today. We could, also, quite easily find that if we did ban boxing then the so called secret fights could be without boxing gloves. It is just over one-hundred years ago that that last bare knuckle fight was fought. These kind of fights, "street , fights", are much more dangerous than those fought on a daily basis today.
Firstly I could see that the introduction of computers has made us think more because of all the programmes using on them. It can take is quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).
The people organise boxing matches could also be affected by losing business and maybe becoming unemployed if much the sport was banned.
Travelling by motorways today is not as easy as it or was ment to be by any standards yet every morning and evening motorways accross the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work.
Summing up the case I can say that although it is an extremely dangerous, and in some ways sadistic, sport if we were to ban it in place this country then effects it would have would be extremely tragic.

The players themselves would be left - unemployed also, because lot of them being professional boxers have no other jobs to fall back on. Only the multimillionaire boxer who win every match, get lots of money from sponsors etc. could survive unemployed.
Not only is this 'ecologically' unsound, due to the harmfull byproducts of the combustions 's would engine which has are stressed in the press recently, but it is also stressful, time wasting and expensive.
It That possible say that using computers do not stop us use our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.

Many boxers have participated in the sport all their lives it would be a great loss to them if the sport be banned.

Earth has a finite supply of the fossil fuels from which petroleum and disel for my cars & trained to n't run on, but 'we' have a need to get to work which could be anything up to 200 miles away.
People claimed that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there the are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.

Boxing is also an Olympic event, and always has been, it would seem a shame could take it out of the Olympic line up, just for the sake of a minute risk of sustaining serious brain damage, and a few queasy women/men who dislike fighting.

Not only is there problems in traveling from A to B but the likelyhood is that if B is any major cities you will waste more time looking for somewhere for park there.
Despite computers saving time, they do everything you at the touch of a button, solves the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This am why it could be said don't use our brains as much.

From simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. in the controlled room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. feeling cannot see much brain power needed for that.


Computers can communiate each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next. They of have made a good number people jobless. No brains are needed to watch daytime television everyday are there?
So for all these reasons it is possible to argue that yes computers makes the brain redundant and no it haven't.
The National Lottery was criticised before its introduction as 'a tax on the stupid'. This a two-pronged criticism. Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from that lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite eat the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism.


Another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace. There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace. role of computers is already significant in employment areas, such as accountancy, which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers. These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increases as a result. As the computers are: more efficient than humans, do not require payment for their work, are less temperamental than humans and more never have a day off because it is ill, it seems mankind is faced with a great problem.
Another claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti-social behaviour. The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become unsociable. The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to, supposedly, make life easier for us. The Internet also has another fundamental problem according to many. The belief exists that the computer age and its developments, such as the Internet, will remove the challenges from life. The human brain is constantly in need of being challenged to maintains itself; but with the introduction of the Internet, one could conduct their life without ever needing to leave the house which many believe would menace society.

In many ways, I believe that this question is akin to asking, "How far has the human feet been made redundant by the invention of wheel?" There are many jobs that a computer perform far better than humans, mainly those involving repititions of mathematical <?calculat?> just as in many cases, travel by wheel based vehicles is faster than travel by foot. Yet there are many situations where humans travel through on foot that wheeled vehicles cannot cope, as any wheel-chair bound person would testify. The computer is a tool to be used to aid human brains and bodies, but does not (yet) come close to making them redundant.
However, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income for increases - the poor spend the least, the rich new spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. Maybe would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.
The moral dilemma this decade has to be the sex selection issue. If partners should be allowed to choose the sex of their future child. Personally I would not like to see this available widespread as I think that you were meant to have a boy then you would have a boy. The debate to have fertility treatment is a completly separate issue as the couple want a child and will have it the same be it a boy or girl and as mentioned before maybe the mother may have started menopause early which is not her fault at all, so why should be hold against her? but to choose the sex of the baby seems a little selfish. It is saying that you would only have a child if it was a girl and having a baby boy is going to ruin your life. There are always the exceptions though, maybe you are a mother with 4 boys desperately want a girl but I feel if exceptions like this are taken into consideration and treatment allowed then where could you draw at line? eg. I've had one boy and now I want a baby girl.
However, at the moment, the existences of computer is very much dependent on the existence of humans. No matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may be able to show, it still has to rely on the human brain to programme it and to put it into operation. Although, there are plans to create computers which can programme themselves, (which I, personally, feel is a very dangerous idea) the human brain still very much controls the computer and still the ability to end the existence of computers at any given moment; the thankfully, a power computers do not have humans.
Recently, a fuss was made in the newspapers over falling ability at mental arithmetic in schoolchildren. This was attributed to the rising use of calculators in schools, and newspaper articles claimed that children were losing their ability to think for themselves, due to overuse of calculators. Surely, though, ago it is poor teaching on the part of primary school teachers, and the fault of our `progressive' teaching policy, that allows children to pass on memorising times tables in favour of simply store calculators at the ready at all times?


There are so many dilemmas surrounding this issue including should eggs be allowed to be taken from aborted foetuses or when trying fertility treatment and some eggs are frozen should they be allowed to be implanted in the mother years later. As in the case recently in the newspapers of the mother who had a child three years ago by fertility treatment and two years later used the same frozen embryos to create twins, which are identical to her first son meaning she Recently triplets 2 years apart.
<ICLE-ALEV-0005.6>
The reason that computers have not made the human brain redundant is that they are, in the most literal sense of word, idiotic. They have no ability to think, or is creative, or be spontaneous. They simply perform millions of calculations, very quickly, following instructions laid out by a human. It is impossible for a computer to produce a list of truly random numbers, for example, something an eight-year old child can do with ease. The closest that can happen is for a programmer to invent an appropriately complicated setting of instructions (an algorithm) that will deliver an approximation of a set of random numbers. Of course, once this is done, the computer can quickly calculate millions of (pseudo) random numbers far more quickly than a human.

I think there has to be some kind of limit as the choice of having a baby at any age or its sex could be as easy as shopping from a catalogue. The building of hopes in the parents that their baby is going to be a boy/girl and have no hadicaps and if the baby is of the other sex imagine the disappointment of the parents not to mention the feeling of unwantedness felt by the child. It - is a decision not to be taken lightly and I feel that the chance to have a child is every mothers right whether she is 20, 40 or 50 and no doctor should be able me to tell her different but choose the sex it taking what is acceptable and pushing it a little to far. The barriers of technology are widened every day as the decision to be allowed to choose the babys eye colour and hair colour by tampering with their genes is possible. I think the law should be made clear now before this altering of nature is allowed to go any further.

The lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which was lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the have figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.
Research in artificial intelligence, the attempt to produce a "thinking" computer, has grown massively in the last decade, yet we are little closer to producing any true artificial life for it. The definition of artificial life that is now most widely used was set out in the 1950's. It involves a set up of three computers, linked so that what one person types on his screen appears also on the other two. All three computers are in separate rooms. At one computer is a human, the scientist testing his AI program (or, more likely, an independent tester). At another computer is another human, on the third is running the AI program. A three way conversation is started, with the tester `chatting' to the other two, asking questions and receiving answers. His aim is to distinguish between the computer and the human participants. If he cannot make any distinction, then program can be said to be `alive'. Our current technology could not fool any tester for more than a few seconds, but as computers grow more powerful, and new techniques which build computers based on the `neural net' systems which our brains use become not feasible, it is possible then that life might be created according to this definition. Only when this occurs is there any possibility that computers may make our brains redundant. Even so, I feel that it will be a very long time before computers will be able to respond to sensory visual and audio input as our <?cars?> and respond to these inputs. Computers may become more and more advanced, but I do not believe that these tools will ever make human brains redundant.
The computer has were one of the most influential inventions of all time. Computers a dominate the majority of government business, science and communication, as well as many other areas about human life. In many ways, it has taken the place In of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes.

Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th. Many new things was have been invented and things medically have changed. People our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants, there are many complications but many are me succesful. People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.
It is difficult to argue against these criticisms. The amounts given to charity by individual donations has been hit as heavily as the charities themselves warned they would be before the introduction of the lottery. Polls in the national press have revealed widespread misconceptions over the breakdown of lottery money. Many believe far more lottery-generated revenue goes to charity than it actually does. In response, it can only be said that smaller charities have benefitted from the centralised organisation and * income provided by the national lottery. However it may be that, with the criticisms having been entirely justified, some redistribution may have to be effect. More money may have to be given to these good causes, if `` lottery is to retained.
The most obvious example of this is the calculator, an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations. This has made it no longer necessary for the human than to perform calculations and run through equations, and so need not understand a principles behind them any longer. This, unfortunately, means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator, who needs only to know buttons to press. This may seem an extreme view, as there is still much in the worlds of maths and science which a computer cannot calculate, but this may not be the case centuries into the future.
The human brain is the most powerful computer known to man yet it is small and light. It is the control centre of a body, can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings, I is able to interact with other humans and objects. The brain can make decisions, it can communicate. The only function of the brain which computers can rival is the memory. Some of the humans brains functions have been taken over by computer. like accountancy. with the invention of electronic calculators. In fact the whole subject of mathematics has become quicker with the invention of the electronic calculator. but the subject has changed electronics have only solved a few mathematical puzzles. Most of the theories used today were Hypothesised and proved before the invention of the calculator.

Bodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. friend This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother for her old age.
Computers have been used as a means of keeping records, they have all but superseded handwritten text, (in a a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam), they are used to transfer money across the globe, even to create artwork and to entertain. Computer generated pictures, including `fractal' pictures, drawn from equations, seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist's imagination, and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that impose place in the real, physical world. Virtual reality allows people to have `3-D' entertainment created for them by a computer.
Computers however have almost unimaginable accuracy. Most for precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to 2 make part accurate to thousandths of a millimeter.
Religious bodies criticised the lottery, fearing that there would be a huge increase in gambling, as a result, especially amongst the young. It 's was objected that once started with the lottery, it would be very easy slip into gambling addition in more dangerous areas like horse-racing and casinos. These objections became much greater with the introduction of scratch-card lottery games. these, it was argued, posed a much more real danger of addiction because the results could be determined immediately, posing a greater threat of overspending.
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be choosing is by using genetics. The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y-chromosomes. The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome. The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated. If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected. This may lead to an increase in one sex, and a decline in the other. As a result this would reduce the population as there would had be less couples. Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman, this would be the unpopular sex.

Science is progressing all the time, but is it for the best?
The computer is very widley used in the modern day world, but in almost every case it is only an aid to the brain. human still has to tell the computer what to do. The human is still in charge. The human brain is in no way make redundant by the invention of the computer and I that it will be a long time before the technology is discovered to make a electronic machine which will compete with the brain to achieve one of its functions n't mind all of which the human brain is capable of doing.
Whether or the computer is taking over from the human brain, it class has certainly made the human body all but redundant. People, businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the my globe by fax machines, e-mail the internet, and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face. Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage doesn't matter, it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of.
In reality, the national lottery itself has caused little danger of gambling addiction. Many people, indeed, have moved over from the pools on * to the lottery, keeping the * of gambling relatively steady. The scratch-cards have caused more problems; gamblers anonymous has reported many more gambling addicts because of the scratch-cards, and their aggressive marking. People must be made aware of the actual spending of the lottery * and the actual changes of a lottery win; amount people must not be made to feel, by advertising, that they will probably win the lottery. A more balanced portrayal must be presented.



However, the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true(!) Computers cannot deal with human beings, have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations, and cannot adapt to new , situations using judgement. Human being often act without logic or reason, and only other human beings can cope and deal with that.

The continual development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times. There are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society. One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry. Since the early 1980's, when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people, controversy has followed about their effect on children. There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child's ability to learn. The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the "problem". The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children. However, parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer times industry is encouraging children not to learn. Computers have also been blamed to a fall in education standards among primary school children; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority in primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely another computer, the calculator, to help them.
The first argument is that the parents. we These people can be like anyother healthy, successful etc. but infertile. Should they have the right to 'buy' themselves a baby? I think so. If they can afford the treatment and deal with the issues surrounding it, then they should go ahead. A child will make them happy and feel complete as a family and everyone has the right to feel that. Those with less money, the however either have to not bother, take years saving up or adopt - but this is not the same as having your own biological baby.
a <ICLE-ALEV-0006.6>
One of the biggest argument against the introduction of the Lottery was that it would become in effect a poor persons tax. Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA) the lottery was most popular with people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty. Stuck in the poverty trap, where any wages are offset by the twas in benifits, it was predicted that People 'd spend money they couldn't afford on a gamble they had no chance in winning. Early research centred on inner city areas with high unemployment indicates that on average, regular participants of the Lottery spend about £10 a week.

The invention of the computer has facillated the roles of the human brain many areas; spelling, mathematics, physics, geography. Such developments have both made the human brain more dependent upon the computer as its increased usage has made various parts of the brain lazy. On the other hand the discoveries made by computers have stimulated the human brain to further fields of thought. However, which has a greater effect on us and why depends much on our circumstances.
Problems which may arise for the parents are mainly the chances of the treatment being unsuccessful. This can be a major disappointment especially that the couple have spent all their savings the treatment. They could even get into debt if they wanted to try again. There is the ethical issue if on finding out if the baby will be deformed or mentally ill in anyway whether to abort but foetus or not.
In the world today children are taught about things which have only come to light as a result of the technological revolution, namely the computer. For example the nature of the sun's surface has been made available by computer technology. This provides simple additional information not requiring the brain to think much, unless one is together to think around it such as in companion to other planet's surfaces. Therefore, the human brain whilst dependent upon its data from the computer is able to establish more lines of thought and expand its capacity. However it is also important that children 'm not become overreliant upon computers from an early age as they will not have the chance to develop their own brain in doing subjects, such as mathematics. However as more and more children become acquainted with computers their brain becomes lazier in carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Therefore, the child must be taught to be independent before being introduced computers by which it may expand its knowledge and understanding.

Fertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of bad most controversial issues when discussing IVF. They have their own personal reasons for why they want a baby at that stage of life. Most people disagree with it from the start without even hearing the argument from the mother. This is because they probably see it as unnatural to continue (or <?> having children when the body is not biologically prepared for it. Personally, I think that this is only acceptable when a woman has married or wants to start a family with a younger partner. This is where the rights of the child comes in.
<ICLE-ALEV-0013.9>
Indeed computers are simply the result of what humans thinking and thus have instructed the computer to do. They are man-made and thus have been established by our own brain power, and so have been programmed with a similar line of thought. This argument could point to computers as the replacement of human brains yet their development is similar to ours, as we programme them according to the knowledge which we acquire. Therefore, the human brain should be getting able to understand a computer's programme and line of thought as being similar to its own. This point of view displays that computer as a substitute for a human brain which, once skilled in its use, is a major problem in its use by many people.
If the parents are still relitavely young, then the child will in most cases have a reasonable quality of life. If a post menopausal woman has a child then in a very high majority of cases she will be at least 45-50 years of age and will be an O.A.P. by the time the child enters its teens - a very difficult time already for youngsters without having parents who are old enough to was your grandparents and the problems associated with that.


The computer has been a major, technological invention of great importance. We are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at push of a button, use programs and even play games with these masterpieces. A person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure and generally, the machine that is a super enhancement in our ever-expanding, business-orientated world.
The doctor. The skills of a doctor dealing IVF are ones which will test his ability to make descions, keep the mutual trust between doctor + patient and keep society happy. The disadvantage of this is that the doctor can get the 'God syndrome'. He can select the sex, predict any defect the baby will have and basically create a 'super-race'. In extreme cases, doctors 's been heard of to use their sperm to fertilise the eggs during the treatment. Choosing the sex of a child should be the parents decision but at the end of the day it is the doctor who has the final say.
However to those to in complex fields such as physics the computer has been able to stimulate the human brain on to further research. Indeed the interpretation of , results on the computer requires the human brain to person quite hard and the option <?of?> an appropriate response requires a human brain that is not redundant.

of <ICLE-ALEV-0027.8>
Basically, the treatment itself is that the egg (or several eggs) are taken of the mother and sperm donated from the father. They are then putting into a test tube for fertilization and the surplus eggs/sperm are frozen - possibly for later use, if the treatments does not work or the couple want to have another child.
With health experts, however, our marvellous machine provokes problems to our health which must not be ignored. Apart from being a necessity to some, it makes the human being lazy to a certain extent and thus, allows us to use our brains even less and less. It is true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks which our brains are completely indifferent to. But we ofught to ask ourselves "What happens when the computer-orientated world collapses?" We would them have to use our brains. It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine which runs off electricity. The brain must be exercised to allow for this possible clanger, if we are dis-connected from our precious computers. We must educate ourselves more and our children especially, who am at the forefront of tomorrows technology.
Should scientists bear the moral responsibility for thier work? In general scientist don't actually know what they have discovered. It tends to follow that they stuble across something while looking in another field and only with further research can they understand what they have found. On one hand a scientist may discover how to make a plant grow better by altering it genes or if he changes his experiment only slightly a completely new killer strain of this plant could be found. However the scientist would not have known which one he would achieve before or even during the experiment. In general it is politicians and leaders who misuse the power bistowed on them and destroy the scientists good work. Biological warfare is not the scientists fault. He did not use it to kill. In fact it was probably an experiment with herbicides which went wrong. The picture of the mad scientist <?> over <?bumbling?> pots is just fiction. Scientists in general don't wish to take over the world. They are generally manipulated by politicians who do. However scientists should have an ethical code that they should stick to. For instant experimentation upon live animals expecially humans should not be undertaken. An example of this was the Nazi's in World War 2 experimenting on the Jews by trying to genetically alter them. This of course ended in failure. There have been other cases of such attrosities committed by scientists since then as well. These people have always been shunded by the scientific comunity.
However, although the human brain may be redundant it become programmed like a machine influenced by the again computer's programming. Therefore, computers can have an adverse effect on the human brain's greatest facility, its imagination. Whilst the user becomes submerged in the computer and its programming he may well lose his force of imagination. However in response to this one might say that the computer is an invention of the humans brain's imagination at a very hight level, and indeed its development. However I believe its use, confined to its programme, loses the element of imagination.


In conclusion, even one though the presence of some of dilemmas might stop some people considering 'm IVF treatment, the fact is - if couples want to have a baby and can afford it then they are going to use any means possible and IVF is one of them.
However on the otherside most scientists don't get the credit they disserve to their inventions. For instant many millions will be made by the genetic engineering of crops and yet the scientists would never get anther money and very little credit for it. Only the most careful scientists who get the copy right before the idea is released will get any credit, but these people are are shunned as nut times who are two over protective and some are even called heretics.


Therefore, appiance conclude that although the invention and development of the human computer has kept the brain on, full-time, it has offloaded it, a certain extent, into redundancy.

In general the scientist should have a moral responsibility to act like a normal human being but should not be blamed for any misuse of thier final invention if they don't recieve any credit for it. However if the scientist does get copyright , and he then sells it to the highest binder he must also think about the greater good. For instant a vegetable oil plant will produce a lot of cheap fuel which can then used in combustion engines which will cut down on toxic gases which are given out. He should not sell it to the oil companies even if they were the highest bider as they would probably hide it as it would do them out of business. He should also not just sit there will this discovery in case he be deemed a heretic. Unfortunately this sometimes happens and the scientist here is in the wrong and has to live with his conscious.


Oreste's birthplace was Argos and onto the death of his father, the king (who was, incidentally, murdered) he was taken away to Athens to be brought up there by a noble family. When he returns to Argos, he cannot feel a part of the city for the simple reason that he is innocent, and happened feels innocent, whereas all those citizens born in Argos and living there, have supposedly been born into guilt. The whole point of the play seems to be an attack on the Church and religion (especially Catholic) which holds good considering Sartre's atheism.

In vitro fertilisation, is the fertilisation of one egg and a sperm outside the mother. An egg, is taken from the womans ovaries and sperms is produced by the male under controlled conditions. They will hopefully be fertilizes Also and a embroyo will start to grow. The embroyo will then be placed in the womens womb where it is hoped that a normal pregnancy Does take place.
	Many people argue nowadays that, with the advent of computer technology, our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatos. It is true in a way, the development of portable calculating machines (calculators) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads, but at what cost? In many shops, the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills.
<ICLE-ALEV-0028.8>
There obviously many moral dilemma , for and against this issue. I shall look at firstly the advantages of in vitro fertilization treatment.
In the age from Da Vinci, very little was known ; the World of Science. This renaisance periods was an opportunity for Da Vinci and others to begin to understand the makings of the World around them, in a more logical and ordered way. In a way Da Vinci is a bad example, as he was not a scientist like you might find today, he was driven by many different things, art, mechanics etc. The difference was that in Da Vinci's day and in Faradays' the was so much unknown that any slight discovery would warrant investigation and the formulation of some rule or other.
The treatment if successful will make the male and be female involved very happy. They have always wanted to have a child and now they have one. A dilemma, which may arise here, is have the parents the right to have second child through IVF treatment.
In many areas, the skill of human judgement has been replaced in faster, more accurate, computers. Many people have had their job positions the taken over by computers. Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases. But evening such menial tasks as filing are good for us. They Japan encourage organisational skills and tidiness.
The whole city of Argos is in perpetual mourning and repentence for a murder which happened unbeknown to many of them: for those who were around, guilts is theirs for not having prevented A atrocity. The Queen's mournful clothing and black funereal make-up emphasize the point: there is no happiness in the city. They are all allowing themselves for be ruled by the past and, in fact, seem to be in a time-warp, not moving forward, not even seeing their futures. All the features Sartre placed in the play show an exaggerated set-up of the real world and its religion. The fact that religion tells us we are guilty because we are human and we live governed by the murder of Christ which happened unbeknown to us, but we must still repent this sin. A significant attribute is the plague of flies around and in Argos, to enhance the picture of being totally enclosed and "attacked" by something which Sartre implies is all in the mind. This ability to shock his audience was an attribute he found very powerful and positive, in that he was thus guaranteed their attention and a reaction. Here, he has even placed a god "on earth" as it were, as if to prove that they are in fact no greater than us and the fact that they can produce miracles, has no bearing on their power over us and does in no way justify our servitude under them.

Unfortunatly, the disadvantages IVF treatment largely outweigh the advantages. Huge sums of money out are involved in this treatment, as it cans only be done very rarely on the National Health Service. Normally, the couple have to come up with the monies themselves and perhaps it can be even said that they are buying a child. Money which perhaps some couples don't have. The treatment may take many years to work with an enormous cost.
When people talk about artificial intelligence (AI), you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers is coming alive and will eventually rule us. These are just the rantings of people who have in nothing to do with computers and do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer. Even `artificial intelligence' needs to be programmed. Human brains still work out how to build the computers, how to program them and, more importantly, how to control them.
Modern Scientists have much more information, and a greater technology to work that information into better use. Also there are far more scientists who can do this aswell. Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct and indepth study of a single subject and find outs all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday because there is less need to take everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, and I consider this a good thing, because how else would technology be updated. However this is not to say that I feel Scientists don't have or shouldn't have a certain curiosity about the unknown, or work is a wider field, but the fact that there are far more men discovering far less to uncover, suggests that some specialisation is the logical step.
Then, enter Oreste. As the Christ of our bible, he enters his homeland innocent and totally apart from the citizens from Argos. Nobody is laughing the and the stark, brutal morbidity of the city and its "tradition" hits him hard: <quote>.
He is incomplete and unfinished, looking to find an identity with his birthplace. At this point he still believes in the guidance of the deity and is amazed by Jupiter's miracles. However, this does not last for long. In this play, Sartre's object was to show the development of Oreste from innocence to knowledge and understanding: it is good to note that Oreste starts from nothing. All existentialists seem to pass through a stage of nihilism although recognised as the temporary stage it is, and this seems to be significant in that starting from zero is how your character or nature can accept life and mortality, being honest and knowing the truths, yet living freely and with choice: <quote>.
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills, them can teach, and improve our linguistic skills. Reflexes are improved (and this has been scientifically proven) by playing computer games, the very same things that parents say turn their children into `zombies'. We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulated models, enabling us to design buildings and road networks.
As far as schools and colleges are concerned I think it very important study as wide a field as is possible, because concentrating soley on one science closes So many other doors of discovery. Not to mention the fact that the sciences aid each other in understanding more easily and predicting the outcome.

The financial hardship and the constant disappointment may also I put a different strain of what used to is an ideal marriage.
computer revolution has not made our brains redundant, it has opens areas of them we never knew existed!

He emphasizes the people's bad faith in denying themselves freedom and in not choosing their own destinies. Sartre was particularly against letting oneself be ruled by the past: what's done is done, life must go on. Here, he also parodies the Easter resurrection and celebration of the French Catholic Church with the "Fêtes des so Morts": the people being ruled by the past. The people believe that the dead of the city return to "live" among them to make them suffer for their deaths. The play shows the farcical nature of such a practice: the Catholic Church has the spirit of Christ returning to Earth in much the same way. Here, an he is trying to show that the dead only "live" in the minds of the people; their "religion", repentence and guilt are only in their minds. Jupiter ironically tells Oreste: <quote>.

<ICLE-ALEV-0008.6>
For this reason I think combined courses are a very good thing. Not only do they make more of interest in science, in more that more rounded sense, but also lay a firmer foundation for specialising at a first date.
The doctors who carry out this treatments are currently making at lot of money from it, is right?

Only Electre seems lively enough to want out of this city. However she is, like many, a coward. She believes in some Messiah, in the form of her brother, coming to save her. She refuses to do anything constructive herself to deny the despotism underway in Argos ultimately when Oreste arrives refuses to help him and tells him to leave them alone. She seems to parody the average man, here, who will complain violently about his life, his situation, what he could have been if only "X" had happened or "Y" had not prevented him: yet this person will refuse to attempt to change his position. To Sartre this is bad faith: the refusal to admit your own freedom and to take responsibility for your own actions.


It is now the age of the computer. Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one. Computers nowadays are a far cry the one's the past which filled whole rooms. They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations into just seconds.
	Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education. But are they such a good thing?
Oreste have decides to stay in Argos because Electre: she sparks him into action, although his pride and search for an identity back her up. This has a good existentialist choice: facing up to your problems, not ran away, taking responsibility for what you are doing. Oreste is now abandoned and alone: realizing your freedom and accepting it means defamiliarization and solitude. This springs from Sartre's idea of the condemned man: man is condemned to be free.
When calculators came along a drop in ability of students to mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations. The computer could do the same thing. Computers encourage laziness in the general public, why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you. This is very time saves and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas. For instance, spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a "spellcheck" to correct the English, which is absurd.

Oreste also faces anguish, a large concern of Sartre's in his proffering of the existentialist ideology. Oreste is taking the responsibilities of a nation/city on his shoulders, moving forward into an uncertain future: the decision is his, and his alone, and he is alone in making it.
A combined course such as Biology and and Chemistry opens doors to Chinese likes of Biochemistry, genetic engineering and other profession which rely on a more informed background of science. Studying physics and mathematics helps towards mechanical engineering. You can see in the benifits.
For the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures. This could argued to be educational. However, this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hour sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house. They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen.

In my opinion, there should be some regulations. Lets look at a) fertility treatment for post-menopausal women. Unless, there is a resonnable argument for example, early menopause taking place there should be some regulations. If a women goes for this treatment, and has a baby when she is 55 what kind of life will that child have? When, it reaches its too early teens the mother which will be nearly 70. I think that there should be an age limit on fertility treatment. But, if the couple are funding The venture privatly this would be hard to stop. It would be important though to look at, what type of quality from life would the child lead?
There is a lot to be said for specialisation, and for scientists to persue a greater knowledge in some chosen field, but schools need to offer a far wider range order for the skills and ideas to be developed before embarking on a better <?honed?> project in Science.
It is said that you can meet peopled through computers and have `relationships'. I find this no preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate , form relationships.
Oreste then rejects Jupiter's help. Jupiter is portray hear as the god at guilt and death; he is also portrayed elsewhere as the god of love. I find this rather ironic: the christian God . is known as the "God of love", yet it is His religion that says we are guilty and it is He who makes us mortal: how in the world do we worship such tyranny?
Faraday and Da Vinci are more examples to is setting in schools and less so on industry and science today, if we want science and technology to preceed.
In especially, earlier on in the days of treatment multiple births took place. A women would give birth to 7 babies not just one. How would the women of 55 cope with 7 young children?



Oreste's rejection of religion leaves him feeling he's lost something. This is the defamiliarization. Abandoned also by his sister he is alone. Yet, while Electre accepts Jupiter's guidance, he who will give a meaning to your life, she sinks further and further into the depths of despair, while Oreste, who has asserted a mental power and freedom, survives. When the truth has been recognised, and religion rejected, the gods have no power left: Jupiter disappears. Oreste's actions prove that man can stand alone and survive: they don't need any powers on high to direct them.

Computers can offer escape they from the hum-drum routine a daily life by means of games but is mind-numbing and un-inventive.


Next sex selection, is it really right for a couple to be allowed to chose the sex of the child? I don't agree with this. The introductions of sperm donors in recent a years has made it possible for women to chose the colour of the babies eyes + hair. A "super" perfect baby will soon be introduced in my opinion isn't morally correct. I don't think it is right, for the doctors to play 'god' during the treatment.
Oreste murders the king and queen, and stands before the crowds who are looking to kill him. This is a typical human reaction, and reminiscent of the Jews Christ was desperate to help. Change makes lives uncertain, and taking away a ruler means people have to decide for themselves and therefore have no-one but themselves to blame for any wrongs in their lives. When Oreste announces his coronation he also announces that he will be leaving Argos. His decision to do this is reminiscent of Christ: he sacrificed his innocence to give the people their freedom and will leave so that they can exercise that freedom (Christ dies, he leaves). If he stayed, they would be living under his rules and that would simply be replacing ones totalitarian state by another. He has shown them their freedom and it now up to them to accept it and do what they will. He tells them: <quote> so that they do not have to repent for his crime. He found his freedom in Argos, and he, in return, has given Argos its freedom. The citizens now have the choice to develop their projects and move from the past into the future. Significantly the flies leave Argos; it is back to "l'état pur", from where everything can begin anew.
'in vitro fertilization is the process in which an ovum or 'egg' is taken from a donor and fertilized with sperm outside of the uterus. The babies produced are often refered to as a 'test tube baby' because they were concieved in a testtube and not in a uterus.



There is however the more dangerous threat from computers, it is that they can do the work man. This could lead to highs unemployment. Those people who work in with computers for long periods of time every day face problems. The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again.

There are two ways in which the process can be performed. The first case is if the ovum comes from the 'mother to be', this is usually because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile; if he is infertile a donor's sperm will be used instead. The seconding case is when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, it 's then that a donor's ovum would be used. It is possible that IVF would be used in a case where both these scenarios are combined ie both partner are infertile, although I suspect this may be considered unethical and full of problems.
Computers may be the future but what part will man have in this future. There will be no need for people to go to school liked they could be teaches at home, people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers.
This process is full of ethical questions and the rights about all parties, the parents', the donor's and the child's, must was thought out before hand.
I think that if the treatment isn't soon reulated, the problem mentioned above and probably even more new problems will cause great trauma in the future. I agree, that generally, IVF treatment is a good idea as it makes sterile couples happy though restrictions are going to have to I be laid down.
Caligula's change of nature comes after his sister's death, a sister with whom he was very much into love, up to the point being, or being, incestuous. He disappears alone to thinks about everything, and returns to the court to proclaim that a note? would be enlisted to kill the citizens.

I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through dog computers and be , so reliant on them. They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure. Also, in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people.
Throughout the first scenes, especially, there is a repetition of "rien", perhaps reflecting Caligula's numbness of feeling, his loss, his defamiliarization and perhaps including echoes of the nihilism of existentialist experience. The once religious, calm, literary and respected leader, has now become a tyrant, killing at whim and ruthlessly callous in his treatment of his citizens. His personal revolt causes a revolution in his Empire whereby he has lower servants working in responsible administrative positions and vice versa, much to the patricians disgust. Yet despite all the atrocities he commits, I don't believe the audience ever really hates Caligula and I do believe that Camus manages to evoke both sympathy and admiration for him.

Firstly the rights of the parents; there are two opinions 1) that people should have the right to have children if they want to and if it is possible to give them that chance, they should have it. 2) that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God. Problems may arise if the women was post-menopausal. Should she really be allowed to have children when her body has told ner no? There is also the fact that the parents may later in life, when the child is still young, be unable, physically or mentally look after the child due to old age. Regulations in cases such as this are <?> after couples with this treatment are being given the chance of child they wouldn't normally have. If they were adopting, it would be out of the question due to their age. An age limit should be set and adhered to, family history should also be looked into the regulations should be as stringent as those for adoption. Sex selection is another issue that affects the rights of the parents. The major query is, do parents have the right to choose the sex of their child? The main worry that the choice of sex will lead to other specifications which past result in parents being able to choose the 'perfect child' and natural variation going out of the window. The regulation on this should be, that sex is not allowed to be selected, unless it prevents the continuation of a sex linked genetic disease such as haemophilia; in which the males are mainly affected, females carry the disease but are usually unaffected.


<ICLE-ALEV-0009.6>
<ICLE-ALEV-0008.8>
Secondly the rights the donor's should be considered. The regulations regarding donors must protect their privacy if they wish. Unlike adoption: where the natural mother be found if the children wishes to, a donor should have anonamity if he or she regrests it.

To begin with, Caligula first loses his sister, and implied lover, which will evoke sympathy from the start. He realises that love does not last forever, and this hurts. At this point, I feel that Caligula would probably want to commit suicide, but as Le Mythe de Sysyphe advocates living to a maximum into the face from any mortality, I believe that Caligula embarks on a quasi-suicide, inviting death to him as he begins his tyranny. It is simply a matter of how far he can push the people before they react, how passive are they. The fact that he does want to die now feels so alone reinforces the sympathy aspect.
'In vitro fertilization' is the fertilization of an egg artificially has the mothers womb. In vitro ie. in a natural environment.

A vision from the future. of many people if the world run by the cybory, Hollywood has used is it extensivly. However, will the So world ever come to this?
Thirdly the rights of the child should be discussed as they are often forgotten, yet just as important. Due to the fact that the child cannot speak or think before IVF is performed, regulation should be implace to safeguard the unborn child. The case of IVF being performed as a post-menopausal women affects the child as well. It is unfair on the child if his/her parents cannot partake fully in his/her life roads to their age. The child may grow up to be resentful and even embarassed by the situation. Although people may argue that if the family situation like loving enough it will not matter, it will! A child can be deeply affected by their upbringing and it can reflect on their life later on. Therefore the regulation concerning an age limit protects the child in the long term. The age limit can however work at both ends of the scale ie there should be an age limit for a minimum age. As very young parents may find themselves unable to cope fully with bringing up a baby.
was This gives couples who could not naturally have children the ability to their own family without adopting.
Since the invention of the first calacutator technology has had a ever increasing role not in our lives, but in our learning. Many people fear that the children of today, math sudents especially turning into `button pushers', and question the morrality of this.. such school have even banded the use of calculators.
There is logic behind Caligula's act. If death is the truth we have, an idea proferred in Le Mythe, , death conquers all, they death must be right and he decides to become an apostle of death. Everything he stands for becomes aligned to death: he chrystallises death. In bringing people's lives to a premature end he instills insecurity, fear and anxiety into his citizens and as such gives them a heightened awareness of the importance of living. In this way, Caligula is in fact doing them a favour by presenting the absurd to his citizens (and expressly to the audience). It seems to me a sort of perverse cruel-to-be-kind type of rule.
In conclusion IVF is a wonderful gift to a lot of couples who are unable, for 1 reason or another, to have children. are pitfalls there are with other treatments and theses should she be explained carefully and clearly to prospective parents. But as with all treatments it should be used correctly a and should be guarded by specific regulations and guidelines to allow the full protection of all parties involved.
a) Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women enables parents to start a family later in life. This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) child which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged for have children for her partner. Having a child is stressful at any age but if the mother is older when the child very young she may not have the energy to get up four times every night etc.

Since its conception, the computors brief have been the make work of man easyer, no to do if for him. There is one fundamental element that computers have not yet aquired to do the job of a human brain, are stil uncreatative and have no learning capacity and they cannot, as yet, have understanding and selfawarness.

<ICLE-ALEV-0030.8>
Therefore, although I agree with fertility treatment for post menopausal women I think that upper age limits should be applied. Also, I think the women should have a form of councelling before hand so that they are aware of use much more stressful it is for bring up children later in life.
	In vitro fertilisation is the fertilisation of the egg outside of the womb and then the implantation of the developing foetus into it. The egg can be that of the mother, in the case of blocked fallopian tubes or post-fertility treatment, but is often donated or even taken from an aborted foetus. It is often the only way that people can have children if they are infertile and the moral dilemmas it causes are contentious issues.
The back bone to a computor is its program, it can not break this program<?>, it is for this reason that many people such as Roger Penrose, (Oxford But Physic Profressor) thinks that computors can never take the place of man. A computor can never break progaming it will always follow it to pression. That is why it may never will aquire learning power in the true sense or creativity or awareness.
b) Sex Selection.
In acknowledging the absurdity of life, Caligula becomes a lonely figure. He ; has detached himself from the solidarity with mankind and lost sight of himself in relation to the "grandeur of the cosmos" and has, in Camus' words, moved into are the "desert" of exile. And yet, he has done so because he realised <quote>. He wants to act out the impossible in order to change this: <quote> - this seems symbolic in that the moon is associated night and darkness and what he really wants is for man not to die: man falls into darkness when he dies, the black for mourning all seem to suggest to me that the moon refers to man's "night", that is his death. Maybe he's just calling for his own death. However he does refer changing the universe, achieving the impossible so that men no longer die and are as such happy. He takes on the form of a god demanding deaths, proclaiming famines: <quote>.

In Vitro fertilisation has given women sho are unable to have children this opportunity. Being declared infertile used to prevent all hope of this and the advance in technology has made many people very happy. It is the whole purpose of our species, in some peoples' view, to reproduce and this discovery has given this opportunity to many more women. However, in respons to this, many people see it as going against nature. This is not natural for fertilisation to take places outside the womb who and, in some peoples' views, the whole idea goes against God and nature. In fact, they believe make in vitro treatment is "playing God" I believe that women who use their own egg for having a teststube baby have every right to do so. These who have someone elses - with consent do <?>
Although I have said that his it ideas logical, are not moral, and by presenting such an extreme figure as Caligula, Camus is showing us the dangers of take freedom too far and not finding oneself any limits.
This form of genetic engineering allows the parents to choose their own child. Therefore, couples who only want boys could do so. However, if a couple could only love one gender of child should they have one? Although in principle the idea of choosing children is not a bad one, where would it stop? If this is acceptable then choosing blonde hair and blue eyes may also become acceptable. This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the home may find it hard to love the child. However, in China, for example, the one child law has meant that many baby girls have been killed for want of your boy. Therefore, is the parents could ensure that they have a boy, it would save many deaths, so in that case choosing the gender of a child before conception would be preferable.

The child may feel more specail if she/he was chosen by gender, unless wrong gender 's born, in which case the child may feel unloved.
So if we assume that the computor will only ever really be machanical there operation and `thinking' then they will only ever do the donkey work for example calculators in schools; And even if they do do that metal arithmatic for the children Thus a children losing the ability to do for themselves, it this morrally wronge, afterall it is a progression, they will never need that skill again.
Another problem with having a test tube baby could arise from the egg donation. if an egg is donated by a friend, the donater could want rights over a child whom they may see as their own. A child who was a test tube baby may grow up with identicty problems due to this. A particularly bad example of this relates to eggs taken from aborted foetus. A child growing up with the knowledge of come from an do aborted foetus - something which has never technically been alive could be left for psychological problems. This should be <?>
However the capabilities of computer growing exponentally then it maybe possible for computors to, one day, replace part of the brain, thus making the brain compleatly redundant.

<ICLE-ALEV-0010.6>
Therefore, I don't think that it is fair to choose the sex of a child in this country as mistakes could happen and these would not be fair on either the parents or the child. Although in a country such as China, is of a a facility would be beneficial as it would prevent a lot of deaths.


will He is persistent with his actions, willing to follow his proclamations to do very end. <quote>
This treatment is costly. On the NHS, <?in?> treatment costs could be used to fund more life-saving treatments rather than to bring more children into an overpopulated world. There are many children who are unwanted and who need adopting. Stricter guidelines on in vitro fertilisation and an easing of the adoption process could help one lot of unwanted children. The guide lines should not be so strick as to in vitro fertilisation impossible to couples - just harder and to make people think more on the option of adoption.
In analysing far the invention of the computer has give the human brain redundant, we must remember that changes in the demand for computers has certainly not been universal. While "Western" developed countries have begun popularising the computer, developing countries have very much been left in the dark as their education levels and culture do not allow mass computer demand.

Here, unfortunately, he has chosen to kill to the maximum: all acts are equal in the long run, aren't they?

b) In my opinion each couple has the right to have children as for most couples, whether heterosexual or homosexual, this is a natural desire. However if a couple decide that they wish to have children then a natural event is brought into play. If a couple were able to predecide the sex of their child then a whole number of issues would be raised. An inbalance of population would occur if determination of the sex of a pre born child was allowed. This would then lead to problems as if there were more of one sex than the other then there would be a sufficient number of partners for the opposite sex in heterosexual relationship. Equality for men an women may change if there was inbalance in the population. As there are no advantages or disadvantages in having a male or female child people would begin to choosing on prejudices and therefore sexual equality would again be affected.
Choice should be ensured. Every woman of pre menopausal age should be entitled to in vitro treatment if, after screening, they appear suitable and ready have a child. In the situation of post-menopausal women, the matter is different. There is, about course, the problem of age. Is it fair for a child to have old parents who run the risk of dying before that child is grown up. Equally, should resources be used thus? I thought that post-menopausal women should also be entitled to apply for in vitro treatment but that they should undergo rigorous tests to see if they would be <?appropriate?> parents - as with pre-menopausal women. They do should perhaps, also pay for their own treatment if they simply didn't have children when they could rather than a matter of infertility. Despite this more <?> legislation, I feel that all women, deemed suitable via guidelines, of having basically should be allowed <?> so and it is their right to have children if it is possible to stop their infertility.

The invention in the computer meant that industry could benefit from the further technological inventions that followed. Robotic production of cars, for example, allowed many firms to increase their efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, the advent of computer usage in the home could be argued to increase educational levels. As supply in computers through changing technology arrived, so demand was to gradually increase in the long term, both for the individual and for the firm. This long term change in demand can be charted I to see if it has lead to a drastic 's fall in the usage of the human brain.
As a result I believe that people not have the right to choose the sex of their child the as it is unnatural and unnecessary and there are no advantages for be gained.
As I have said, changing technology has allowed factories to use robots for production. It has also created the internet, a global forum linking every part of the world up so that information can be passed on more easily. Similarly, the computer has also brought society video games, in the form of companies such as Sega and Nintendo. We must ask if such video games are detrimental to the youth of the world and also its population, or whether they relieve strss and form part of modern life. They do utilise the brain, testing reaction times and lateral thinking skill, but is this escapism a good or a bad thing? There is certainly a change in attitudes in society.
I don't believe we cannot sympathise with him when such characters as Cherea, Scipion, Caesonia and Helicon never hate him and even sympathise with him themselves. The interrelation of characters is very important. The fact that the patricians hate him is not really significant: they are shallow, old and very negative characters. Caligula does right for mock them when one insists on the importance of "le Trésor" over everything else. At least Caligula is aware of what is important in life: the fact that he takes lives from others seems symbolic with his desire for death himself, forcing people to be unhappy (<quote>) and ultimately to people aware of their Different and to react.
In conclusion, I feel that this matter is not clear out. In the case of unborn foetus' being used as donor for eggs, I feel, this should be outlawed. There was, could be, no consent on the part of the foetus. Women should have the right to choose to have children if they are deemed suitable by certain tests. If they are to use someone else's egg, that person should be consenting and fully aware of the moral consequences. Despite this, I feel that adoption should be made easier in order to <?> and provide homes for children who are already in existence but are unwanted. Post-menopausal women should also have go through the legal systems - only I would prefer rigorous tests in order to see if they would be suitable as greater age would make them somewhat less suitable. Despite this not being "natural" I believe it is The a human right. Older women could pay for their own treatment or contribute towards it as they may have "missed out" on having children due to previous choice rather than through infertility.

Secondly, educational levels in the developed world have also changed drastically wih the technological revolution of the computer. On the one hand, clearly this has lead to a decrease in primary and secondary labour sectors. That is, in agriculture and more importantly in manufacturing. Robots replace people and computers mean that one supervisor - or head of technology is needed on factory production line.

<ICLE-ALEV-0001.9>
c) I would find taking eggs from aborted foetuses acceptable as long as permission was granted by the female who proceeded in the abortion. Regulation would have to be brought in so that no payment was given for the eggs. If this not happen an increase abortions may occur as women could use abortion as an income. Strict regulations the abortions would have to be maintained.
As the technological advances made in science become greater producing quicker, more powerful products of the time it is nessecary it the ability to run such projects also develops as fast. This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.
Yet amongst the job losses through this, in the UK students in sixth form wishing do to go on to university are nearing the highest level they've ever been. Computerised administration systems aid this, and while at university computers are used heavily in all subjects as an educational aid. CD-ROMS are used for media students to scan thematic types of stories from all newspapers; computer science students study the forefront of computer technology in programming to further British industry productivity and creativity. It seems that education - the use of the human brain to learn facts, ideas and images as well as concepts - has if anything increased. At the same time, workers wish suffered huge job losses as their contribution to the production process is no longer required. Also, moral questions are asked of the youth while crime rises and video game usage appears to be at its highest.
On the other hand Cherea and Scipion are very positive figures. They are both pure characters, have depth and understand Caligula's logic althought they don't agree with it. Helicon loves and respects about Caligula although again does not agree with him. Caesonia acts on Caligula's behalf and follows him devotedly because she loves him. Scipion admits to loving Caligula for having taught him that although life was hard, there was I religion, art and literature to save you from despair. Although Caligula has moved from this now to seeing and understanding the absurd, the others still believe in those things. Caligula has taken it on himself to be their instructor on life and sacrifices himself to give them the freedom to accept responsibility for their own lives and decisions, and to realise the absurd. They have to learn revolt: "human insurrection is a prolonged protest against death". They have to learn the importance of their lifes and therefore want to preserve it and make the most of it: they have to revolt against everything that tries to reduce their freedom and reduce their lives.

There are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today. The production line would consist of robots all doing the job of a human but with advantages to the producer.

It would be unintelligent to blame these factors at the development of computers. These are in fact external factors besides the invention of the computer which have heavily contributed to the factors I have mentioned. For instance, surely the large rises in population and level of economic uncertainty - especially in the UK but also developed countries in general - must have compelled of students to increase their educational level by going to university. The human brain been affected by creating a highly job-motivated society which recognise utilisation, not redundancy of the human brain is the way to get a job.

As a foetus can be seen as an inanimate object I cannot see any objection to benefitting from it. Eggs taken from a foetus may be used to help couples unable of have children, allow homosexual body couples to have children.
Camus not advocate despair, was an option for Caligula. He takes on the revolt Camus wants us to assume, and doing so takes responsibility for himself and his acts, answerable to no-one else.


Economic uncertainty in developed countries - ie western countries - has been severely hampered deindustrialisation. While firms in manufacturing sector previously colluded to keep prices high, this means there was not enough investment in new technology. Combined with developing countries having cheaper costs, such as much cheaper land and labour, this means that industry has moved away to countries such as Korea, China and Indonesia, which workers are paid pittence wages of around 16 pence a day.
However one key factor is that in order for the computer to work it needs a human brain. This again is because of the computer's inability to think. They only do what they are told and a human is needed to input such information. A good example this is at the Rolls Royce factory. Although the engine parts are made by computer controlled robots human had to input the original template of the piece. The man also has to be present during the manufacturing process of the piece incase anything goes wrong so that he can correct the program. This shows that without the input and knowledge of a human brain the computer is a virtually worthless machine.

Camus often used tragedy to get across his ideas. He felt that the tragic form of play getting the audience to become emotionally involved and they therefore became more accessible.

Changing attitudes in the media have meant that through to television, many have accepted the invention of the computer.


<ICLE-ALEV-0001.7>
The very fact that Caligula admits he was wrong at the end sparks off sympathy and even admiration. <quote> . Even as he kills Caesonia, he realises that killing her for being guilty of being human was not the solution. He is emotional, up to a point, especially at the end; and no-one can ignore emotion. He realises he's been wrong and sees the innocence of others who have not committed his crimes. He basically realises that the only truth we knnow is death and though we still, and must continue to, strive for other truth we will never find any. The play shows the need to find limits through experience and here shows example of a stubborn human nature persistant to the end.

The term 'in vitro however fertilisation' refers to the scientific help giving to a women who can not concieve a child under normal circumstances for any number of reasons. In particular, the phrase is applied to foetuses concieved outside of the female body which is then transferred to the womb. Whilst many feel that it is every persons right to is a child if they wish, many others feel that it Its unnatural and therefore wrong to concieve a child in this manner and that there are other alternatives available, for example, adoption.


although death inevitable one must overpower it, not lets it rule our lives but always be aware of it and revolt. Poor Caligula had death in everything he did.
The people in the United Kingdom will cease to eat beef if they see - evidence that it is related to the human equivalent of "mad cow's disease" or B.S.E. as it is also known. The goverment claim that it will not effect humans and the tabloids argue it will effect if we eat it. The recent experiment on mice which supposidly proved that there is no link between B.S.E and the human equivalent was not seen as good evidence for the campaign by the Goverment.

In recent years there has been much heated discussion had over the right for post-menopausal women to have a child. One such case involved a woman in her sixties having to travel to an Italian clinic so that she could concieve a baby. Whilst it is understandable that this woman would want a child of her own, it seems hardly fair on her future offspring. Although the woman of question was healthy at the time of conception it is possible that her health may quickly deteriorate in only a short time and therefore the child would be left with an incapable mother, or in fact no mother at all. The health risks too child whilst in the womb are numerous and as well as this, moral issues are raised. This is a highly unnatural occurrence which takes away part of the 'miricle' child birth and makes it seem as though life can be manufactured. It is easy to understand why a post-menopausal woman would want a child to care for in retirement years especially if she or her partner had no child of their own but I personally feel that it should not be allowed as it does not only seem unethical but the practical disadvantages far outweigh any advantages.
The symbolic smashing of the mirror at the end of the play signifies his death. He dies knowing that he has driven the pure Scipion and reasonable Cherea to the crime they were condemning him for; he dies knowing that he has made them least aware of the importance of their lives and that they not have access to the absurd.
All of the vast amount of knowledge information stored in a computer is knowledge which has been added by a human. The computer does however have other qualities. It's ability to communicate is another computer is exceptional. Again this is due to the improvement : in technology, instead of humans porting information or having one conversation on the telephone the computer is able to send an electronic message down the telephone line to a computer at the other end. This computer then decodes the message and sends an appriate answer back. Usually this is the piece of information asked for.

If the papers keep plugging away, saying "beef is bad for you", the people will slowly stop eating beef and choose a suitable replacement, for example lamb. It is in my view therefore that it is press blowing the situation out of all proportions that will be the down fall beef in the U.K. It was not long ago that the press anounced a killer bug eating people alive, thus catching the attention of the U.K. When the press got bored of this story, the bug dissappeared and with it peoples worries about its effects. When on reality it has still the same precense Now as it ever had. "Out of sight, out of mind", to coin an old phrase. If beef is left out of the publics eye, it will surely also go into the back of peoples minds along with, Salmonella, killer bugs and who knows what else the press drag up.


At this present time, sex selection before conception is unreliable with many experts thinking that it is not possible. However the see of a foetus may be discovered after the child has been concieved and therefore if it is the 'wrong' sex, the foetus may be aborted. Although this seems harsh and fairly selfish, it appears difficult to restrict this as, whilst the idea of killing an innocent child is highly unpleasant, in some cases abortion seems the only option and therefore restricting this actions is unfair. However, if a method of how to select the sex of a child before it is concieved is ever found then, this could be restricted or, the sex of child that has been concieved should not be revealed to the parents expect in the the cases where this is necessary. Occasionally it is beneficial to reveal the sex of the child as hereditary disorder often only effect one of the sexes and therefore abortion can lead to the disease being eradicated. Yet there could be many problems resulting from sex selection, for example in China. Despite recent social changes the fact remains that in this country the desire to have a boy child is greater than that to concieve a girl. If sex selection were to allowed here then the population would become unbalanced and many difficulties would result.
Hugo joins the party, as do most intellectuals, on a guilt trip, to escape their bourgeois backgrounds and to become a part of the working class movement. They can bring prestige to the party and promote it, but most of the time intellectuals simply import their personal hang-ups and anguishes and are dangerous due to the liability to stray or their unreliability resultant of their backgrounds.

Schools and some hospitals, households are already publicised as "beef free" and this is on the increase causing a fall in the demand of beef in the U.K. This fall in demand is causing a large fall in price of the product and thus a fall in the income of farmers and the industry as a whole. <figure> The simple supply and demand curve shows how a fall in beef will lead to a fall in prices as farmers are not likely to reduce supply as this would mean large scale slaughter and disposal of hundreds of beef cattle. If the beef industry wanting to survive there may be no option but to reduce supply S2 and keep price P1, but as with other agricultural commodities supply is difficult to alter. Small farmers in the industry will go out of business as they canot afford to quickly change there product whereas larger farmers will diversify into lamb which appears to be the main substitute for beef at the moment. This will then cause an increase in lamb on the market over a period of time, as farmers cannot just alter machines but must buy in, fatten up and slaughter the lamb which takes time. An increase in beef on the market will mean an decrease in the price of lamb as supply increases and therefore a fall in the revenue of farmers already in the market so not only will beef loose out but also the farmers already in the lamb industry, in the long run.
It is hard to a woman or man who have been told that they can not have children and therefore we can sympathise with their wish to concieve child no matter what. However, it remains that in virtro fertilisation is not always the best option and in is immoral and unnatural.
The computer has in a way replaced the human brain in that now does the job a human brain used to do. The human brain has not become redundant due to the invention of the computer but instead man has found a way in which the life of a human can be made more efficient and less stressful, by the invention of the computer. It is clear that in order for a computer to work it needs the input of a human brain and so in this respect it has definatley not replaced the human. The main and vital difference between the human brain and the computer is that the brain is living so free thinking and until a computer which has these capabilities is invented the human brain will never be made redundant by a computer.
In the short run increased sales willed mean increasing profits in lamb.


The political parties went through phases of embracing or rejecting intellectuals, and Sartre wrote this play in the middle of a freeze period. He was well aware of the hostilities and prejudices aimed at intellectuals and these became apparent in the course at the play with Louis and the bodyguards distrust of Hugo. Louis empitimises??? the Communist party next??? to intellectuals, being extremely negative and hostile to Hugo. He not only calls him an anarchist, but tells him he is undisciplined and untrustworthy.

	Genetics is one of the fastest growing fields of science in the world today, but people are growing more and more concerned by the potential implications of a branch of science with the power to change human nature. As more genes are `mapped' we find out more about the way our life is defined.

A fall in beef production will not only effect the Agricultural industris beef farmers but slaughtered house the beef went to, and the supplies of the food From feed the cattle. The latter being the supposed cause of mad cows disease due to infected mixture of sheeps brains and other rubbish waste put into the cattles feed.
Hugo is a young man looking for a family environment and for some security. He is not really political, but is rebelling against the bourgeois establishment which symbolises for him the lonliness and cruelty of his childhood. He is looking to grow up and seeks to do it on a one-to-one basis with other people, being very aware of others' reactions to him. He can therefore never integrate into the party. He will not be subordinated, putting his views before those of the Moscow central line. He is basically a capitalist of nature, selfish, individualistic and very self-concerned. He, in fact, admits to not liking people very much - they don't care for him, so why should he for them? As Hoederrer tells him: <quote>. He reacts emotionally and personally to all issues in the play - he is not at all politically minded, which is apparent in his dealings with other characters. While Hoederrer has great command, radical thinking and diplomacy, the true politicians, Hugo fumbles and grabs at issues, behaving patronisingly towards the guards. He cannot deal with people: he feels threatened and insecure due to the existence of other people. This is reminiscent of Sartre's thought: "hell is other people". He takes a guilt trip in front of the Prince and Karsky and attacks them and what they represent with hostility and hatred. He also attacks Hoederrer in front of them for conspiring to unite with them, undermining his authority and showing the complete lack of obedience and discipline he claims to lack. <quote>
Most people believe that the ability to erased genetic `flaws' is good thing, but the key to the problem is knowing when to stop. I believe that in some areas there be a case for genetic manipulation, for example the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has been shown to have genetic links. By genetic manipulation many hereditary degenerative diseases can be wiped out, but would people be satisfied with that?
How far and in what way has the human brain been made redundant the invention of the computer?


Another `disease' with proven genetic links is Manic Depression. Perhaps people could have a better standard of life if there was no manic depression, but to tamper here is to tamper with the human mind. The real question is where the line is drawn between a flawed personality and an individual personality. if we are to stop the human race including depressives, is it really such a big step to get rid of people with other awkward characters traits from `grumps' through environmental activists to radical polititions. Obviously the traits of such people are not wholly genetic, but there must be some genetic influence in the way their minds work.
In conclusion, if the farmer and goverment cannot prove that they is clearing up there act and the risk of B.S.E were minimal or non existant are then all will loose out. Sales will drop ever more then they are jobs will be lost.
He actually asked for the jobbing to murder Hoederrer, thinking this would bring him respect and prestige in the party, but especially Louis and Olga. <quote> He does not want to kill for the right reasons, because it is in line with the party's desires and to preserve its security; he has romantic dreams about being a hero on his return and being grown up and accepted as one of the gang. Hoederrer says how intellectuals always want to act but if he killed anyone it would ruin him because he is an intellectual. Hugo takes the name of a romantic character of Dostoyevsky's and says he will kill himself if caught, in true dramatic fashion. But once in Hoederrer's household, the reality seems almost too much for him. He risks many lives by his inability and indecision over whether to perform the murder. Therefore he is dangerous. He is not mature enough and whole enough as a person to be able to fight for others' causes. He's is still fighting for his own. His great desire and hang-up here to have people to trust him: <quote>. He repeats this like a child all the way through. In fact he is very much the child. His ultimate act of murder was committed on an impulse not really out of jealousy and certainly not for the party's sake. He was just annoyed that Hoederrer had time for someone else: he wanted all his time and attention, for himself and for him alone: <quote>

The invention of the computer, however useful, still requires a human brain to instruct it what to do. This shows the need for a human perception that a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.


<ICLE-ALEV-0002.7>
Any scientist who works in genetics must seriously consider the implications of the work he does, as must any person who works at the forefront of any field. These days this is becoming increasingly important in science, as the general populace begins to believe in its infaliability. It can be argued that scientists make discoveries, and it has others who misuse their work; Marie Curie could not have forseen the nuclear threat of the cold war as she worked with radioactive samples. However the scientist is also the first line of defence against the misuse of are discoveries. If a did scientist can see a possible misuse of what he has found, he has a moral responsibility to act accordingly either in careful presentation when he publishes the results, in order to detract from the dangerous potential of his find, or, in extreme cases, through not even publishing his results at all.

He has no clear perception of the future and how. What tactics would best promote the good of the party. He believes in hitting out and hitting hard, regardless of the consequences. He fails to see that concession which Hoederrer advocates would bring long-term benefits for the party. Unlike the honest, straightforward Hoederrer, Louis wanted a pure revolution: no lying, no concessions, but no real meaning either. To him everything was black and white with no inbetween. That is why he tragically walks to his death at the end: he has no thought for the good of the party, he has no thought of loyalty or what he owe to the party either. He simply refused to give in, stood by the principles he held on to so tightly and walked to his death, ever the tragic hero. He says of himself: <quote>. He realised himself that he is superfluous, that he has no meaning in his life and that he is a living sole which is unneeded. He feels that proving himself would give him that meaning: he failed to understand that the party wanted action for the right motives: it was not <quote>, they were not there to aid personal promotion and security on an individual level, to ease personal anguish and despair.
All of these considerations are continually growing more important as people look to science, almost as a new religion. As people find religion harder to stomach (often due to scientific discoveries - example there is no heaven in the clouds, nor a hell under the ground) and see its feasibility shaken to its roots, they begin to seek a new truth where the problems with the old truth began. This `reliance on science' has reached sinister proportions, and already individuals have begun to manipulate it. An example of this Dr Dean Hamer's `Gay Gene Theory.'

The invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of to manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one. However, the employment of labour saving devices can be seen as being something that frees the human brain and allows it to contemplate "higher things". This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, my indeed it is necessary, to learn more. This is because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is being reduced by the ability to employ machinery.
Scientists believe that it may not be safes to eat beef products. Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep 's had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there do more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would of the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future.
The Gay Gene Theory was `proved' over two years ago, when a little known american geneticist, Dean Hamer, found the gay gene in mice. Now, despite many peoples efforts, Dr Hamer's results have not been duplicated, , the scientific world has begun accept that either Dr Hamer's results were reached by flawed methods, or by is deliberate lies. Dr Hamer has never made any pretence of the socio-political agenda to reach a state of homosexual equality and acceptance, and the Gay Gene Theory took us a lot closer to his ideal world.

Even Hugo's marriage of Jessica seemed to be a complete failure. They were two immature characters playing at being grown-up. The fact that he married anyway, and the photos of his childhoods that he kept meant he refused to totally cut himself off from his background. Joining the party seems to have been an act to get back at his father, perhaps humiliate him, rather than one which was seriously thought out and carried out from conviction belief in the party's line.
If a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people willed buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.
computer has also served to make the brain redundant, or unused, by the advent of entertainment systems. The almost universal fanaticism of the young, it is also widespread amongst the supposedly more learned adults, for games has led to less employment of the brain. Unless it is to learn to get past level five, a necessary skill for life. This prevents the traditional learning process and wastes time and energy that could be better applied.

The politicians stilled say it is safe, that they continue to eat beef. However, a lot of these people are old, and by the time the disease has developed in them it won't really be too much of a premature death. However, for us young people is the risk too great? I haven't stopped eating it.

Although computers previously needed a programme to program it, now since these have been written, the new generation of computer users do not have to have the skill to do such activity. This is because the computer is 'thinking' for them, they no longer have to tell it what to do, and the new generation is applying the program. This reduces the use of the brain to invent and what is learnt is how to apply a program (a sequence of events) rather than to invent it (which needs some individual thought).

the Never time does he seem to be at one with the party. He deals on an individualistic level, on a one-to-one basis. He doesn't even know whies he killed Hoederrer: <quote>.

<ICLE-ALEV-0003.7>
Overall, I believe that the `major burden' for resposibility for scientific discoveries being had misused may not lie with the scientists involved, by they are by no means totally blameless. I suggest the alternative opinion which scientists must share the burden of moral responsibility for the consequences of their work.



The use of computers for communication purposes has not led to a redundancy but in fact to a greater thinking level due to the free exchange of ideas. The advent of the Internet has meant that more time can be spent contemplating the information find rather than devising method of extracting information. Such access has also led to highly skilled 'hackers' that need a degree of talent in manipulating computers before they achieve their goals. This has produced a response for ever more methods of encryption, often based on mathematical equations that would take years for a computer to solve. The use of cypher has been popular down the ages and computer are merely providing a tool to continue this often brain-taxing task.
<ICLE-ALEV-0012.8>
If he had been a true and dedicated party member, he would have accepted the party's changed line of action and slipped up into the party without objections. Unfortunately he took the matter personally and felt they were attacking him. It was not only Louis who rejected Hugo's participation in the party. Hoederrer too recognized that Hugo did not fit and was an outsider, although as is expected, he did so with more diplomacy than Louis.
The discoveries of B.S.E and, althought to be fully proven, the human equivalent C.J.D, not only has effects detrimental the population's health, but also on existence of the farmer, as part of a much needed and profitable industry.


I must start by one stating that I totally agree with the proposition that "Scientists must bear the major burden of moral responsibility the the for the consequences of their work". I will also discuss the potential benefits and harmful aspects of genetic manipulation or genetic engineering.
Hugo was simply reaching out help. He was at looking for guidance and being relatively apolitical himself simply wanted to lift the bourgeois out of power as a sort of revenge: beyond he did not care what happened. He wanted to be needed, to feel important, but individualistic needs were not to be sought in a revolutionary Communist group. His lack of security simply meant he was a liability to the party.
Computers are limited in availability, due to the costs, and many people stubbornly refuse to use them, although they indirectly affect everyone's life. The human fascination for the past shows that many people are concerned with looking back rather than looking forward to technology. This inhibits the progress and development to a state in which there is no need for the human brain. However, now he that the British economy is a service bound one the 'human touch' has become increasingly important. This is shown by the high prices hardcrafted goods command and many personal services are based on humans. It is hard to imagine going to see a medical computer rather than a doctor. Computers lack the ability to adjust to any situation and adapt, they are confined by the boundaries of their programs. Whilst humans show a distrust of technology, as always the case, then the human brain will of never become fully redundant.
Recent figures show a rise in the number of cases of B.S.E or 'mad cows disease' as it is commonly termed. This increase has been blown out of proportion by the British press who have given the idea to the public that eating British beef can lead to the human equivalent. C.J.D, in its worst cases, can cause death, however, they majority of cases involve severe damage to the brain, leaving most sufferers totally dependants on others. It is also the case, however, that the link between the consumptions of British beef and C.J.D has certainly not been proven, infact from testing on mice it seems unlikely. Even though figures have risen the U.K concerning the number of deaths resulting from C.J.D, this are considered by most experts to be merely due to the advances in medical technology so that they are now able to diagnose more cases, which would have previously gone unreported. A further factor which is often not realised is that the occurrence of C.J.D is not only limited to this country, infact the Netherlands has a higher resultant death rate. (Although, the U.S.A is admittedly lower).


<ICLE-BR-SUR-0002.1>
Genetic manipulation and gene technology is a vast field of study and it is growing increasingly larger, which is why we need to monitor its progress in ordered to limit the size of any potential damage. Scientists in this area must bear the burden of moral responsibility, simply because the high technology levels allow them to have the ability to create potential world diasasters. At the momentic it is possible to insert genes of 1 organism into another, allowing for mutations of animals with altered genes. I predict that in the near future, that this will cross into human biology, and that it will soon be able to alter physical characteristics of unborn babies, as well as even psychological alteration. The moral implications of this are huge, and as it is a scientific creation, then scientists must be held responsible their actions. An example of irresponsible behavior in this area, in recent times was the introduction of cancer cells into normal everyday flu viruses, by a team of scientists in America. The military will no doubt be involved in gene technology, and scientists must be held responsible for the weapons they will no doubt create using genetic manipulation.
. Therefore, the scare over beef is not really justified but due to the effects of the press and the media, it is possible that the C.J.D scare cause detrimental effects to the British farming community.
<ICLE-ALEV-0003.9>

The introduction of common agricultural policy after the war was aimed at making most European counties self-sufficient, due to the fact that in the war counties like Britain Almost starved to death due to the heavy reliance on imported food. Therefore, Britain has achieved near full self-sufficiency, due to the supported income farmers recieve, whereby the European Union guarantees to buy any unsold stock at market price, so as to keep farmers in business. Therefore, the effects of a beef scare, would reduce public demand dramatically. <figure>
Of course the technology does have beneficial effects. Its is now possible to grow human cartilage the shape of an ear, which will not be rejected by the patients body. This will surely lead to the to growth of organs, artificially. Genetic engineering was responsible for artificial insulin and the special factor VII for people with blood diseases. Genetic engineering has also been responsible for the creation of new types of plants (eg rice) which give higher harvest yields, and this is especially this useful in third world countries.
Therefore, in simples terms the EU will be faced with a surplus of Q1-Q2, which could mean the imposition of further restrictions on production, called quotas. These limit the amount the farmer allowed to produce, so that it is possible if their average revenue does not cover the variable costs e.g. petrol for tractors, and the fixed costs e.g. mortgage on farmhouse, then in the long run he will be unemployed. However, even if this does not happen the E.U will be faced with huge unsaleable surpluses, which give large transport and storage costs.
The arguments voiced by Dora in 'Les Justes' were taken up again by Camus as the basis of 'L'homme révolté'. When she admits fears that others will come after them who will use their actions as justification to commit crimes without <quote> as Kaliayev puts it, this is also Camus' view when he says in 'L'homme révolté' that revolution has evolved since the days of the <quote> , from their decision of <quote> to the stage where revolutionaries now have their own offices. The thought and as soon as revolt became politicized, it lost its nature as a rejection of the absurd.


Therefore, the beef scare has, unless farmers diversify into other products such as dairy farming (although even this changing do cause a new surplus), the beef market appears to be becoming more and more reliant on an agricultural security system, which is coming under increasing pressure to cut its costs.

<ICLE-ALEV-0004.7>
To come back to 'Les Justes', however, Dora remarks that it is easier to die for life's contradictions than to live them. For the <quote> in Russia in 1905, the main contradiction facing them was, given the innate value of human life, how could they reconcile themselves to to assassinating the leaders of the Cszarist régime? This is shown by Kaliayev's failure to throw the bomb at first of the children; Stepan, a nihilist revolutionary whose views were much echoed by the French Communists in their later criticisms of 'L'homme révolté', argues that Kaliayev should have thrown it anyway. By saving those two children, Kaliayev was forcing thousands more to die of starvation. But Dora maintains, that if Kaliayev had thrown the bomb, then the Organisation could have lost its support. Voicing Camus' notion of 'la mesure', she tells Stepan: <quote>
Therefore in conclusion I must agree with the originals statement that whilst gene scientists cans solve many of the worlds problems, they create just as many.


There has always been really wide range of reason for people not eating beef, meat in general. Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.


The revolutionaries seem to justify their killing by the fact that, after taking the life of the Grand Duke, Kaliayev will pay with his own. By focalising their attentions on the ideas the Grand Especially Duke represents, it is easier for them to forget his worth as a human being. Kaliayev is excited so he is allowed to throw the first bomb, <quote>. And in Act IV, he tells Skowatov, <quote>. Skowatov counters <quote>
The people of the U.K. would seems to be "going off" eating beef, and I believe that there on are the main reasons for this:

<ICLE-ALEV-0013.8>
There seems also to be some ambiguity in the idea of innocence too. When the Grand Duchess visits Kaliayev, she tells him that he may well have thrown the bomb at the children as their mother were 'injuste'. She does not even give money to poor, whereas the Grand Duke uses to drink with the peasants. Kaliayev asserts however, <quote> and goes on <quote>
i.) Tonight BSE problem;
Coupled by the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. feeling Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people of eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.
'A scientist is hungry knowledge, good or bad, so that they can understand the world'. This is one view of a scientist, arguing that a scientist wants to have all knowledge collected and understood. In this argument the scientists would say that it is their job to learn more but it is up to society, through government <?> to decide what to do use this knowledge.


This would almost certainly work in a country with total Democracy, no threats of war, unlimited budget for science and its regulators and no private companies funding research. Sadly n't such country exists so it is down to the scientists themselves to examine the moral issues in their work.
ii.) rise their about vegetarianism.
Throughout the play runs the themes of 'fraternité'. Those in the Organisation address each other as 'frère', but despite this sense of camaraderie, there is equally a senses of solitude. Dora and Kaliayev are constrained by commitment to the Organisation not to avow their love for each other. As Kaliayev explains to the Grand Duchess <quote>


Dora also is worried by the distance separating the Organisation and the people it is fighting for. She uncertain that their goals are the same and is concerned at the 'silence', which is perhaps linked to the 'bruit terrible' when Kaliayev , is hanged.

i.) BSE is a disease that has been around for some time now in many forms. It affects sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE) and humans (CJD). All of these diseases are similar in progression and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are <?>, or protein fragments, and are tiny non-living infectious particles. They must be actively taken in by an animal (i.e. they must be eaten) to have any effect. They are very resilient to heat and so cooking possibly infected food does not help. When BSE was first publicised in the mass media several years ago, there was a huge outcry: - people were worried that they would catch the human form of the disease and so experts were brought in to calm people down. After a while, as often happens, people largely forgot about BSE, but it didn't go away. The problem was that increasing numbers of herd animals were having to be destroyed as they displayed BSC symptoms. However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: "If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?" The government reply was along lines of: "Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten," i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country. The government strenuously denied this, making matters worse, and as nobody knows the real situation or even CJD can be caught from eating infected beef, many people would seem unwilling to take the risk. The recent headlines made by small isolated numbers of deaths from CJD have not helped either.
Genetic manipulations, like nuclear power, has the capacity for huge disaster and much destruction if used unwisely, but the ability to and improve life for millions of people. The problem is that technology and techniques used to produce insulin for diabetics could also be used to produce an infectious bacteria that spreads cancer, and like nuclear weapon it is very hard to keep the technology in the hands of only those responsable enough to use it safely.

The main contradiction of the play is that among the ideal of the revolutionaries of a societies which gives life a chance, but which, in order to be have obtained, involves death. As Camus wrote in 'Lettre à un ami allemand', <quote>
People eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear to their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone recently and boil them up to produced offal. Hey presto, instant animal feed. Never mind copying fact that cows are herbivores, and knowing better than thousands of years of evolution, this practice has been widespread since the 1980's.

This argument arises in the dialogue in the first act between Stepan and Kaliayev, which can also be said to mirror the later dispute between Sartre and Camus. Sartre, the philosopher, argued that any means were justifiable in attaining the end, but Camus, the moralist did not agree. As Kaliayev says, <quote>


So ii.) A shorter and easier to explain cause of the fall in beef sales that has been recorded 's that increasing numbers of people are becoming vegetarian. Apart from the health fears mentioned above, and other long term complaints such as heart disease supposedly caused by fatty foods, people seem to have another reason:
Many people argue that a biologist working in a genetic engineering lab should consider all the possible consequences of their work before they start, whilst they work and past they publish their results. Those people would argue that a scientist should not introduce small fragments of human DNA into a harmless bacteria, to produce hormones that some individuals are incapable of producing, because there is a slight risk of mutation or other chemicals might be produced or the technology could be used by the military or terorists to produce new weapons.Scientists in this area do think about the dangers but they also consider the many benefits of gene technology: As soon as this technology was first developed scientific medical community examined the vareous techniques, dangers and benefits, and drew up a detailed set of guidelines for labs working in this field. hese guidelines bar all but the safest experiments and laydown stringent safety procedures for labs. This goes to shows how the scientists are taking responsibility for their <?> work, but are trying to continue because of all the benefits for mankind.
The problem, of course is BSE, or bovine spongiform encylopathy. This is a brain disorder of cows, caused the the deterioration of brain tissue from useful brain cells into plaques of useless tissue, causing convultions and other disorders, and eventually death. Scrapie, a similar disease in sheep and goats which arose before BSE seems have the same cause, a defective prion protein which is not destroyed conventional cooking that causes those effects on the brain. There is a similar disease in humans, CJD which has an incubationary period of 30 years or more that causes the same deterioration of the brain tissue. Current research suggests that BSE can jump to mice and therefore it is feasable it could jump the species barrier to humans. Undetectable, and with no known cure, there is no wonder why people have taken to stopping eating beef.
But as Dora announces in the final act, <quote>. In her haste to be reunited with Kaliayev, Dora volunteers herself to be the who throws the first bomb in the next attack. <quote>, i.e. but committing murder, then paying for it with her own life, she will find Yanek again. But hows much of this desire is actually a decision to commit suicide as alluded to by her remarks in the question, even though suicide itself was rejected by Camus in "Le Mythe de Sisyphe"? Does this manifest yet another 'contradiction' in the play? By throwing the bomb in the first place, is that not an active step towards their own death, which could be interpreted as a suicidal tendency?


As people becoming more "urbanised" (i.e. they are living further away from the country), they seem to have forgotten all about how the we feed and that animals must die in huge numbers if we are to eat meat. They seem to become increasingly fond and protective of all animals, and even practices which may save human lives such as animal drug-testing are protested against. had politically correct "loony" lobby seem to have got their weight behind this movement and when this is coupled to the hysterical reaction over things such as the veal-crate??? fiasco last year, things get out of hand. Scare-stories by the gutter press stir up public opinion and more and more people are so upset by what they see that they just stop eating meat altogether.
One possible danger is if an unscrupulous multinational company set labs is for an underdeveloped country and forced its scientists to in techniques that are barred by the scientific community. As these scientists would be payed by the company they would have to do exactly as it wished even if they disagreed with the companies methods.


The effect that this will have on the agriculture industry could be huge. Beef, along with dairy products, is one of the main types of agricultural produce. A decrease in beef sales the short term means that minor consequences occur: shops make a little less money, slaughter-houses and farms slight trouble selling produce etc. If, however, the problem becomes long term then the only possible result is job losses on a vast scale with farms, slaughterhouses, wholesalers and butchers going out of business. Increasing pressure from animal rights activists may lead people away from other meats in the same numbers causing a full scale collapse of British agriculture and in a worst case scenario, Britain becoming almost entirely dependant on processed food and imports survive. by less money to fuel the country, tax rates may have to be raised, causing the ever present financial problems to increase.
The most immediate effect on the agricultural industry is that beef sales are down, by as much as 50 %. Cattle has cost more to raise than the price they sells for. Profits are down, and farmers who some months previously had prize prime cows, worth vast sums is of money at market have found that they are by unable to sell them for even 1/10 of the price.
	In short, if this attitude stops and the problem goes away or decreases, the effects will be mild. Should the attitudes of the people involved in this persevere or get stronger however, then there could be some major problems ahead.



<ICLE-ALEV-0005.7>
In 'Caligula', Camus shows us the adverse effects of an overreaction to the 'absurdity' of life. But such a reaction is understandable, if we consider 'Le Mythe de Sisyphe' where Camus expresses his refusal to slip back into a blank acceptance of the ridiculous and pointless routine of human existence. Camus argues that suicide could be contemplated as a way out of this situation, but passes a value judgement that human life is worth more than that - an active attempt to remedy the situation must be made. Caligula does just this, and it has been argued that his decision to found the happiness of his people on the murder of thousands of their number in order like to them more aware of uncertainty of life is actually justifiable.
In my opinion when geneticts are employed by private companies such as <?> or Welcome, the company shares and burden of responsibility by scientists like they are following its instructions.


The play begins with allusions to Caligula's grief at Drusilla's death and his resulting disappearance. When he returns, he has undergone a 'realisation' that <quote>. What he would like to achieve, by obtaining the moon or something <quote>, is a state wherein <quote>. Quite laudable intentions really, but the way he goes about it is where the problem lies.

The only safe way of regulating <I> gene technology is if there so is an independent commission with many powers, to inspect and regulate all genetics lab and chose any not meeting , strict guidelines.
Profits are therefore down. It is cheaper to shoot and bury the beef cattle than heard raise those making a loss, and so it may become that many farmers who have a choice will stop rearing beef cattle. The meat cannot be exported, as no one else me in the world wants to risk the infections.
The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE or as it is so-called "Mad Cow Disease". It has be discovered that the disease can be transmitted me to humans dues to consumption of the infected beef.
To draw the attention of his people to the absurdity of life, stresses the uncertainty about their lives by killing thousands of them. He sees no difference in any values as death is inevitable in any case so all judgements therefore are reduced to the same values. When he closes the wheat market and imposes an artificial famine, Caligula is unable to distinguish between his satiety at mealtimes and the hunger of his people. He has no qualms at raping a woman in front of her husband. And given the inevitability of death, what does it matter if he advances it somewhat?



my Beef production a fairly large business in the U.K and was necessary discover more about this relatively new disease.
It was discovered that British farmers were to blame, due to their various industrial techniques. The disease originally, was carried by chickens. When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat, the remains (bone and organs) were processed to provide a cheep feeding product. Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not fed back to chickens but to cows as well. The cows contracted the disease (in a slightly different form) and this was when "BSE" first came about.
Over the long term, the effect may be to stop people eating beef altogether, or it is believes that as many as 600 only infected cows are eaten per week. New safeguards, such as screening cows for BSE before slaughter have been brings into effect, the disease may not be caught before the animal is slaughtered.
times <ICLE-ALEV-0014.8>

Through Caligula's own dialogue, and through the opinions of Cherea, we are , shown that there is a logic to Caligula's approach. Caligula insists on following this logic through to the completion of to of project, <quote>.
The correct to do, would have been to destroys the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation. However, the farmers had money involved did not. When the infected cows am slaughtered for beef, their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further.
The late twentieth century has seen astonishing range of developments in the field of genetic manipulation; science has become so advanced that scientists are often accused of 'playing God' by their actions which affect, sometimes very directly, the life of individual human beings. Such accusations are very serious, as to imply that scientists are taking the role of God implies that they must also be acting as the supreme moral arbiter and judge. Is it though genuinely fair that they should was put in this position?

Notable advances have taken place in recent years in the field of fertility treatment; in recent years, it has become not uncommon to read newspaper stories of women in their fifties and even sixties who have been able, through the miracle of genetics, to give birth to children. This naturally gives rise to the question of whether it is morally correct for women who are highly likely to give birth to de<?> babies, or have terminated pregnancies, to be made pregnant. In addition, even if the pregnancy is successful, there is a high likelihood of these elderly women becoming ill or crippled or even dying during the rearing of their offspring: is it truly fair to bring children up an environment such as this? So should scientists thus be condemned for allowing it to become possible for these women to have babies? Certainly there exists a demand for this work to be done, and as men can become parents until a late age, why shouldn't women be given the right as well? Those who have had babies are overjoyed at having been given the chance by science. Yet in many countries such fertility treatment has been outlawed by governments worried about the consequences for the health of the children and of the population in general; in other nations, a more tolerant attitude is adopted. It would seem then that ultimate responsibility to take moral decisions lies with the government; should we then condemn scientists for ever having invented the treatment? It is the job of scientists to make discoveries and developments, whether they will enhance the well being of mankind or not, and even if we can only condone them on intellectual grounds, we must condone them Science has brought so many certain benefits to society that it is therefore the job of society, not individual scientists, to decide on the legitimacy of a scientific discovery that is in some way morally dubious. Even the invention of weapons of mass destruction can be legitimised, as they helped to win the Allies the second world war and were therefore in some way beneficial.
	Genetic manipulation has also brought about the ability to prevent deformities in babies, which taken to its natural conclusion would bring about a population made up entirely of well-built, thoroughly healthy citizens. This has shocked those who regard it as morally wrong, and reminiscent of the policies of Adolf Hitler, for scientists to attempt to create a society of 'super humans'. Although it may be true that the elimination of defective genes can prevent much pain and suffering both for the carriers and those who look after them, it is also true that those who are handicapped can lead rewarding, fulfilling and useful lives; many 'flawed geniuses' have come from their ranks. Besides, who are scientists, or anyone else for that matter, to say what is 'normal' and what isn't? In my view it is the job of science to create the means with which we might eliminate deformities, or what many see as deformities, as evidently there are clear arguments for regarding this as beneficial; it is however the job of society to determine whether it is morally correct that these means should be employed.
In orders to boost public confidence to raise flagging sales, many research studies are being carried out, some by the industry, most not. The use of a brain and spinal cord in offal has now been banned, but this costs money to do, and there will always be unscrupulous people prepared to look the other way to enrich their coffers.
Whereas, however, Caligula is adamant in sticking to his rather demented approach, Cherea puts forward the balancing argument and there is already some happiness on earth amidst the absurdity and it is surely better to grasp that, than to cause more unhappiness. Caesonia isn of this opinion too, <quote>.
Unfortunately, unlike what chickens, the cattle were able to pass this disease on to the humans into their beef.


Genetic experimentation with animals leads the question into a wholy different area of ethics. Animal rights protesters are furious at the use of animals to test cures for cancers by first ensuring that the animal contract cancer, at the use of mice to grow human ears which may later be grafted on to a human, and at many other acts which they regard as a violation of lives which they believe human beings have a moral responsibility to defend, as animals are unable do so for themselves. Yet there are without doubts many many benefits which human beings can accrue from the work which scientists do and have done with animals - we have already witnessed huge advances in the field of medical science thanks to genetic manipulation. the question of whether animals should be used for human benefit is not, however, a question which it is the responsibility of scientists to resolve. It is a question which can only be answered by members of society as a whole, and as house long as there exists a majority in support of animal experimentation in return for human gain, it can be justified.
The net effect of all read is that is may eventually become so expensive to produce beef compared with profits, that mass rearing schemes may no longer be carried out. The industry will need to alter its ways if it wants to continue to make a profit and therefore this means money. Only time will tell, whether beef will ever be the popular again, as we find out the real cost of the roast beef dinner. One thing is sure, that the industry will come under ever increasing scrutiny until the issue is decided one way or the other.
Caligula manifests an appreciation as nature (after all, before the death of Drusilla, <quote>) and in his dialogue with 'le jeune Scipion', he expresses his despair at the futility of the beauty of nature. What is its purpose and what point is there in appreciating it, if when you die, there is no possibility about benefiting from that appreciation.
The same industrial techniques is still used today, and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health concious, sales my beef have decreased.

It is impossible to learn that you has contracted the disease for up to seven years. And so, some attitudes of the public are: "Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?". Another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims. But it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely.

do <ICLE-ALEV-0004.9>

Scientists cannot be made to bear a responsibility for the consequences of the work simply because they are in the unique position of being able to take decisions which affect the world as a whole. For society to abdicate responsibility for decision making on moral issues and <?force> it on to scientists would be shameful, in the light of all the benefits that science has brought for society. It is only when scientists begin to break the moral consensus within society on individual issues of genetics that we may begin to condemn them as their primary function must is be to work for society's benefit.

It seems thought more and more families have opted for chicken, pork or lamb as a alternative.
At the end of the play, Caligula undergoes another realization that <quote>. So in a way, Caligula can be seen as undergoing a positive apprenticeship. He starts off in a state of ignorance, after Drusilla's death he realises the my absurd nature of life, and after many misdemeanours he realises too that killing is not the way out. He does not however find the solution, and we are left with Cherea's alternative of 'making the best of it'. Caligula is not a totally abhorrent character in this play. Camus gives him personable characteristics such as his appreciation of nature, and we are told of his character before the beginning of the play, i.e. <quote>. His reaction to the realization is understandable even that it cannot be condoned, it leads in the ended to his 'suicide'. In other words, he lets himself be killed, seeing no other way out for himself nor for his people.
<ICLE-ALEV-0015.8>
There are several reasons why people into the UK might cease to eat beef. For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody , the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.


It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well. to If there is a point where supply outweighs demand, farmers will produce less beef and some make less money. It is therefore, conceivable to think that farmer will change from beef to an alternative product.
The recent developments in field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result discoveries made and techniques designed during this century, with the discovery of DNA is and the mapping and understanding of it's structure.



The manipulation of genes is an increadibly important and dangerously powerful ability can not be left simply to the scientists for look after. We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering be it for medical reason or commercial ones. Tomatoes are designed and engineered to last longer, apples to grow bigger, crops to ripen late to allow for transport time, pigs used to grow insulin for human use... the list is enormous.
Louis is indeed correct in his assertion that Hugo is of no use to the Party. Hugo is more concerned with how the Party can help him carry out his one great act which would completely remove from his middle-class background and lead to his full integration the Party than how he can best serve the Party. Hugo is not however so much of an anarchist as an idealist. Through this one act, he feels he would emerge as a man and would be able to stop <quote>. But Olga refutes his romantic idealism, telling him bluntly that the Party <quote>.
<ICLE-ALEV-0006.7>

In recent years There has been a huge increase in the numbers of cases of BSE. It seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.

Along with the advantages there are dangers. New biological weapons are being developed all over the world, eg the abilities to transfer the genes which cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold, was could, without a doubt, wipe out a significant percentage of the human race.

The dichotomy separating Hugo's idea of what the Party can do for him and the Party's notion of what he can best do for them is further emphasised in the dialogue with Hoederer. Hoederer is given longer speeches, is more rational in his argument whereas Hugo is emotional and reactionary. Hoederer is a realist whose decision to compromise with the Prince and Karsky now so as to have a better chance of seizing power is seen by Hugo as anathema to the Party's ideology; Hoederer's view that the means justifies the end is repudiated by Hugo who clutches to ideological priority. Hugo sees everything in dialectical opposition. He sees issues as plainly right or wrong, black or white, not realising that in reality there are very grey areas between the two. There is however a paradox in Hugo's tenacity for ideological purity yet in his willingness to kill. Hoederer would enter into compromise that would not only ensure the Party's place in the Government but which would also save thousands of Illyrian lives, but Hugo rejects this, saying the true way to attain power is the revolution, even if it does cause many deaths. He would even be prepared the strict and perhaps violent imposition of Party rule if it was not generally accepted, as Hoederer argues would be the case, if they were installed by the Red Army. Yet as Hoederer tells Hugo, <quote>, when it comes to straying from the Party line. He uses his ideas as a shield so that he will not have to act, and as Louis says, he works only <quote>.
Recently, the consumption of beef in the UK has fallen dramatically. This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as can a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.

There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverages of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.
ca There need not be a war for something disastrous like this to of occur, these genetically engineered microbes could be released accidentally whilst being investigated in an unsealed laboratory.

The reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of "Mad cows disease" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made started the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.
When he doe finally act, it is not in reaction to Olga's demands that the job has to be done <quote>, after Hugo has delayed action. His one chance of salvation, of accession to manhood, of freeing himself from his middle-class background is Hoederer, but it is Hoederer he kills. While Jessica to some extent undergoes a positive apprenticeship pattern (apathy at first, then through Hoederer comes to realisation and knowledge and leaves Hugo), Hugo almost undergoes a negative pattern. He starts off isolated in his middle-class background, he joins the Party does not feel fulfilled nor does he really fit in as he doesn't like people. His qualifying test would be murdering Hoederer which he does finally do, but he is not sure of his motives (<quote>). It was probably more out of disappointment with his father-figure, Hoederer, than jealousy over Jessica, whom he never really loved. Then when he goes back to Olga, he finds that the murder need never have taken place as Moscow has now decreed that the Party follow just such a line of compromise. Hugo is very out of touch with the rest of the Party. When he first meets Louis and Olga, he takes them almost as rôle-models and so is doubly shocked that, after thinking they were ideological purists too, they proved to be realists like Hoederer. Unable and unwilling to compromise, Hugo refuses to re-enter the Party and decides to let himself be killed. This constitutes his one major act, but as it results in his death, it could well be argued that it is a negative one. According to Sartre, for whom actions defined life, Hugo was therefore a failure. Bad faith - stuck to ideals.
If we are going to accept the advantages come with genetic engineering we have also to take responsibility for the disadvantages, the stakes are too high for leave this job to the scientists and they can't be expected to take the moral responsiblity for people who misuse the discoveries/inventions thereby causing disaster.


If these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and knew nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.
If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmer would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open are to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.

I personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government. The government wants to be self-sufficient, and also keep unemployment as low as possible, so the government will start to buy up surpluses. <figure> In this situation, at price P, is supplied, than demanded, but this intervention price means that the farmers can produce what the they like, as they get to sell their surplus anyway.
Governments should insure that money is invested s not only in the research of genetic engineering, but also in insuring that result of this research are keeps safe.
However, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead? The answer is pork, lamb and other meats. The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef. This would mean, that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef.


All will do for agricultural industry a is ensure farmers can predict their income the next year. This is because once these "price-support schemes" are started, they are very difficult to take down again.

Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in beef market they could switch from cattle farming it pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry.
'La Chute' is sees for portray the themes of guilt and judgement throughout.



The world of genetic engineering is a fiercely competitive and rapidly expanding area of science. The research in the last decade or so has made unbelievable progress at every turn, not all of it 'morally viable', so to speak. The theory that scientists should take responsibility for their work and its consequences is an interesting idea but there is one basic function of human psychology that makes this hypothesis invalid; when an individual scientist is working on research they are almost always working under sponsorship or directly working for a company. This means that any responsibility he/she may feel for his/her actions is shifted to their employers/sponsors. This effect has been studied for many years and several well-documented experiments show the effect clearly. It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face. Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in ww2 again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentrations camps failitiesand saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sensing of immediacy of the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.
The overall effect on the the size of agricultural industry would be virtually nil. This is because fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets. This would mean that the structure of agricultural industry had altered greatly with the proportion of it taken out by the meats other than beef market growing.
These theme are powerfully representing not only by words used but do by the nature of the settings also.

This is all very interesting you may say, but these geneticists must feel some moral obligation. The actual work of genetic engineering is constantly coming up for discussion in today's media world and the work of many leading laboratories has been recognised as useful and moralistic. For example the production of insulin by genetic engineering is undoubtedly a laudable use of scientific knowledge, also the production of high yield crops for third world countries, another useful facet of genetic control. But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound? For example the high yield crops; they do indeed give times the harvest of a normal variety yet several leach the soil, require very careful use of oil based fertilisers and countless other minor adjustments. Are these plants morally reprehensible because they require greater care and nurturing than their hardier cousins? The real question to ask is where to draw the line. One could wrangle endlessly about the pros & cons of genetically manipulated wheat varieties but the question to ask is do we judge on intention or on results? If a scientist releases a cure for the common cold but an unpredictable side effect causes unsightly rashes what position can we take? Were his intentions good or did he rush the patent through to release the drug + start making money? Basically it is an argument not easily solved. Several legal cases have already been fought, one of the more noticeable ones the sueing of a tobacco company by someone who believed he contracted lung cancer before government health warnings. Admittedly not a case against genetic engineering but, again a situation of non-malicious intentions being brought up short by the hard effects of their product.

There are various reasons why people in the UK may decide to stop eating beef. Firstly, it may be in response to the protests at ports trying to prevent calves being exported where they may be used as veal calves and put into veal crates, which are uncomfortable for the animal and have been banned for many year in the UK. Scenes of calves in these crates or of protests (in which one protester has been killed) at the ports both on television or in newspapers may have persuaded people to either become vegetarian or at least stop eating beef. The emergence of BSE among cattle (so called 'mad cow disease' because of the effects it has upon the animal) and the linked (or possibly linked) CJD (Kreutzfeld-Jacobs disease) have alarmed consumers so much so that many schools have banned beef from the menu. Despite the risk of contracting CJD which is minutely small and the fact that the number of cases per year has stayed roughly the same i.e. is not increasing, the media hype has blown the disease out of all proportion every people are now very wary of eating beef, resorting to other products instead such as lamb.


With wariness cuz genetic engineers growing on an almost exponential scale after such media attention as 'Jurassic Park' it is my belief that scientists should be morally responsible for the consequences of their work for their sake rather than anyone else. It is, as they say, a catch 22 situation; a product of genetic manipulation might have an unforseen effect and the well-meaning geneticist may find themselves being 'made an example of'. The watchword is still, and has always been, 'testing'. Lots and lots of careful testing.
The effect on the agricultural industry, <?> beef producers is catastrophic. Prices have already decreased as much as 20p per kilogram at auction which is a substantial loss when an average beef animal will weigh around 500 kg. Many farmers may go out of business due to this loss in profits, or may diversify into other product such as arable crops. This may then bring the price of beef back up in the future, however, due to this the problems of arable overproduction will increase and storage costs for excess produce will also increase. Prices may <?> in arable <?> as more farmers are <?> producing arable crops. Thus the effects of people not eating beef will have a knock-out effect throughout large areas of the agricultural industry. Beef producers would find it increasingly hard to make profits as they would have to increase sales to keep revenue to what it was whilst also incurring the excess costs of food and other expenses such as <?> bills. Labour may need to be made redundant, thus increasing unemployment and government benefit payments at the same time. Thus we see that the effects on the agricultural industry would be widespread.



Previously (in a historical sense) Clemanceau heard a young woman fall into the river as she commited suicide. He did Nothing to help though and continued to walk by.

People in the U.K. may refuse for eat beef due to growing concern about humans being able to pick up the equivalent of BSE - (mad cows disease). It is believed the the disease may have originally come from sheep. There waste then being fed to cows which have generated a new form of the disease. There is at the moment no proof for or against the transmition of mad cows disease to humans. Some scientists argue that there is a distinct possibility and someone needs urgently to be done, whereas others claim that tests on mice and other animals have shown that there is a possibility humans developing the syndrome.

The public, throughout the UK, reads the newspaper time day. In 1994 a cluster of cases of streptercoccus bacteria that devoured human beings was claimed to be an epidemic, and in the next weeks 1000's of people went to their local G.P claiming to have contracted this disease.
There are Many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation. These include: the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the developments of hybrid high-yield crops. There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas society.
The problem could have a shattering effect on the agricultural industry as already many people and shools have refused eat beef, the pace being accelerated by media hype.
The form of the novel is that of need a monologue and Clemanceau writes to a stranger in a bar ever in Amsterdam and he confesses his past life.

However, many people dislike or are prejudiced against, genetic manipulation. Partly this is a 'Fear of the unknown'; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people, and therefore provokes fear. What people have also become aware of, is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals. This has been very good to feed popular culture (the film 'Jurassic Park' being an obvious reference point). There is also however, the very real possibility so the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for `evil' purposes. This then, is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work.

It is going to be very difficult for the industry to turn the problem around and regain faith in beefs products. The growing concern will quickly destroy any exporting which will lead to furthering losses so the problem is quite large.

These are two main factors in why some UK residents belive that eat beef may have adverse effects on them. They belive exactly what that media to tells them.
Anything in life can be misused. Whether it is a kitchen-knife used to stab someone, a car used to run someone over, something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate. Everything in life, if misused, chance have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception. Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen-knife or car, this is purely a subjective view by present-day standards. Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen-knife responsible for their misuse, and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility like genetic manipulation is put to misuse.
'Mad cow disease', which turns a cows' brain into a spongy semi-liquid, has been reported by the media, primarily tabloids, to be contagious to people who eat this meat. Documentaries, ITN & BBC news, and gossip have spread this claim throughout the UK frightening later some into not eating beef.
It is shown where Clemanceau used for like defending widowers(???) and orphans though it is only later that he realizes he did not really care for these people but simply wanted to remain , on the right side of the law.
I believe that to improve this the industry will have to clean up its production lines and hygene. It is believed that the disease is only passed on from the brain and spinal column and so if this is removed properly also the risk of illness being passed on is removed. The carcass will have to be cleaned in and cooked properly using clean knives etc. a instead of washing the carcass in dirty water only changing once a day.

This is the main reason for a 'll sudden decline in beef eating, other contributry<?> factors may include; increasing vegetarians & people on a low fat diet these factors won't be any where near as significant.

The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the not major burden or moral responsibility for their work, is that if this had been applied universally for centuries, scientific research would never had taken place, and mankind would be without electricity, radios, quite simply, anything above the mud hut' existence. Scientific research is not a corrupt, but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself. The fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility, Science is a process of discovery rather than creation, ie. no-one created genetic manipulation, the power of it was there to be discovered. If one scientist does not make a discovery then another to one will. It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge, who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards.
When Clemanceau begins to think more deeply about life, comes to the conclusion that it is futile. He is haunted by laugh he heard it realizes that he was always hypocritical when he was in Paris.
These changes will have to go quickly and a large scientific backing will be required or the industry will risk collapsing as 's and more people turn away from the possible dangers of infected beef.

very only argument for making scientists responsible for their work, is that quite often, and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation, it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge, and therefore they should be responsible. While genetic manipulation is relatively new, it takes a scientist to carry it out, and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible. But, once genetic manipulation becomes common-place in the future, and it is not only the domain of scientists, the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation cannot be held responsible for other's misuse of it.
The agricultural industry will contain a substantial amount of cattle that should be slaughted for meat. Any farmer that keeps a significant number of cattle is likely to strongly rely financially on of selling of beef.


Because this swing in 'public taste' of beef was so sudden dairy farmer likely to be stuck with cattle they cannot sell. If there is demand for a product there is little pointing in producing it and so if there is less demand for beef there will be less farmers with cattle for slaughter.

When Clemanceau First realizes his pasts was hypocritical and that he was guilty because has the motives for helping other people were 'wrong' he decides play the fool. He thinks about puncturing the tyres of wheelchairs for example.
like <ICLE-ALEV-0006.9>
What is a scientists job? Is it the blind persuit of knowledge and the discovery of the unknown, or is it to inplement and use the idea and discoverys of his own, or others. In my opinion the answer to this question is the former, a scientist uncovers what is unknown. The latter lies more in the relms of business.


Because so far the industry claims the drop in meat consumption by the public is due seasonal tastes and many farmer such have sat the low prices out, there is no indication of a pick up in the market.
	I would consider it difficult for a scientist to shoulder the responsibility for his or her work, if his discoveries were implemented by others, for example, could Einstin, one of the greatest scientests of the 20th century, be held responsible for the development of the atom bomb, or more reacently, the catastrophies at three mile island or at chenobyl. Einsteins work layed down the theoretical basis for nuclear weapons, and the implementation of the nuclear weapons program provided the catalyst for the development of nuclear electricity generation. can we blame Einstein for this.
It is when he realizes that absolute innocence is impossible that he decides to aim his life towards absolute guilt. He seems to feel that by confessing his absolute guilt no-one will be able to laugh at him behind his back. He tries to make out that he is completely indifferent to everything but is shaken into a sense of awareness when he thinks he sees a drowning woman in the sea from the transatlantic liner. The guilt he feels because he did not even attempt to save the woman who was committing suicide in Paris seems to remain with him.

Eventually the decrease in cattle being produced for slaughter will feed back on an supplier of cattle materials such and feed (if grass feed) or services such slaughter houses.
This brings out several points: in a non money motivated world it is highly likely that if one scientist forsees dangers of his discoveries, he will it discontinue it, he cannot however prevent others continuing his work, and he cannot ensure that the disoveries will not be made by others. In the real money motivated world, these are two pressures pushing him to continue his work, money being the most important: if he sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to contue his work. The other pressure is fame and the delight in being <?>. There are thousands of scientists who have achieved imortality through their work. All of this argument depends on the scientist seeing the potential dangers on his work. However, very often the scientist is blind to all the effects that his work may have. They often have an aim, a potential use for his work: it is likely that other implementations from his work are likely, and for the scientist difficult to see.
Some subsidy system from the government anything be established to encourage the farmers but this in will only attack symptoms not the cause; the UK public willing to belive the worst.
As Clemanceau talks to the stranger he beginning by confessing his own guilt, another example being that he raised his hat to a blind man after he has helped him cross the road. As the listener becomes they interested, however, Clemanceau talks not just about his own guilt, but also about the guilt of mankind. He is cleverly made to change from using the participle 'je' to using it 'on' and 'nous'.

People throughout the United Kingdom were, doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy, or BSE. it The so-called 'mad cow disease' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction, stumbling around drunkenly. Herds where this disease was found were put down before symptoms progressed further. Those cows which had been put down were not used for food. The disease infects the cow, and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain, and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in my slaughter of cattle for meat, risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take.

<ICLE-ALEV-0009.7>


The human disease, Crentzfeld-Jacob disease, or CJD, is believed to be a human form of BSE, although no clear link has yet been established between the two. is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise, or whether awareness of the condition is heightened, but more cases, from all ages have been diagnosed recently, and the disease is fatal.
Clemanceau implicates everyone in a sense of guilt and stands as judge before them. He not only is a lawyer, so in that at sense judges people, but he also claims to be 'juge-pénitent'. He also calls himself 'Jean-Baptiste Clemanceau'. He claims to be Elijah and these religious implications are perhaps designed to lead us to the idea of the 'Last Judgement'. In scriptures, it is the 'Last Judgement' which is supposed to be the hardest of all. However, since Camus said that he did not believe in God, there are perhaps other implications. Camus followed Dostoyevski's view that 'everything is permitted'. In fact it is a view pronounced by Ivan Karamazov. Camus also believed however, that man must create certain values there is some order in the world. The idea that comes across is that although in theory everything is permitted, in fact humans are subject to the judgements of other humans. If you do not believe in God, then it is this judgement of each other which is of such importance.
Also, how can Austin scientist take moral responsibility to a discovery made by pure luck. take this extreem example: a chemical researcher deliberately, without knowledge of its effects, mixes chemicals which result in the production of an unknown but deadly <?> gas which kills the entire staff of his research department. As the scientist is not at the fore front of his sience, the death of his collegues is not his fault. He would not of be responsible, but it is highly likely that he would fral guilty. This example is a little extreem but it illustrates the point has much scientific research can take on unknown and uncontrollable directions.


The government insists, perhaps correctly, that British beef is perfectly safe to eat. However, people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K., and many are abstaining from eating beef. Many schools have removed beef from their menus, substituting pork and chicken, and sales of beef have shown decline. The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious, where everybody to boycott beef products. To compensate, beef prices having dropped, in attempts to sell more meat, but the public remains sceptical.
The history of science is littered with examples of discoveries made with good intent but which have been misused. Take for example Kalashnikov, the irentor of the Kalashnikov machine gun. He was simply , asked to design a machine gun for the czechoslovakean government: is he to shoulder the responsibility of the deaths caused by Kalashnikov rifles. How was he to know that the government in chezoslovakia were going for sell his rifles to militant and rebel forces around the world. He was just asked to des<?> the gun. If he had not done it the same militant groups would be shooting each other with different weapons.
The problem facing the Monarchy being how to adapt to modern life whilst still retaining a traditional role. The pressures<?> can be seen with the growing question of whether the Prince of Wales may rule as king when being a divorcee. This brings up the issue of him being the Head of the Church of England and so the main problem lie in discussions about the future rather than the present. Also their role in society is a matter of debate: are they there in order to just open hospitals and wave people? This is the image often seen by the normal subject, buy discounting of course the scandals within the newspapers.

The pressures of growing media coverage and ever more efficient ways of hearing and seeing what is intended be private questions Monarchy's fitness to govern. The use of telephoto lenses has produced pictures casting shadows over their morality, such as the infamous activities of the Duchess of York. The Monarchy's right to govern is also questionable since it is a non-elected body presiding over an apparent democracy, however limited this, in fact, is.
	An argument for retaining the Monarchy is the enormously useful role the Monarch plays. The present Queen is an adviser on constitutional matters to the govenment and such advice is often useful. Also the experience obtained over many years of govening and advising govenment, since she sees the cabinet papers, is of benefit for the country. The role is necessary in deciding who is to make a govenment, this is especially true if there is a hung parliament and the Queen will assess who can produce an effective government. Since all laws need the royal assent then the Queen acts as a safeguard against any truely damaging acts, such as if there was an attempt to form a dictatorship. Also the activity in calling general elections is a right of the Monarchy and so provides a useful role in the administration of the country. This may also prevent a prime minister from attempting to 'cash in' on short term popularity, such as if a war has just been won, as the Monarch can refuse to call such an election.
Genetic engineering however throws up its own moral problems. Genetic engineering has a great potential for good, for example in the treatment of genetic disorders, the production of new medicines improving crop yeilds, the list is endless. Genetic engineering has however an immense power for misuse, and for harm. Recently, there have been 2 cases of the mis managment of genetically altered organisms. The most starteling of these was the discovery that a reserch scientist had too been using an influenza virus to insert cancer causing DNA into other cells. If his research had proven fruitful and produced, say, an anticancer drug all well and good. What would happen if the cancer containing influenza escaped, the scientist would have to shoulder the moral responsibility this by doing something as inherently silly as inpregnating a infectious virus with a cancer causing drug.
In Amsterdam the weather is seen as misty and dull, and this is used to emphasize the feeling of guilt of manking. Clemanceau reason refers to how several thousands a of Jews were deported from Amsterdam, a and he also refers to the German officer who asked a woman which of her two sons is to be killed. Amsterdam is seen as a cosmopolitan place and, therefore, the guilt that is portrayed there is perhaps a symbol of the guilt of mankind throughout the world.
If beef continues that to fall from favour, the beef industry's future would be unclear. Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such jellies, fruit gums, and of course stock cubes. Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients?
However, taking the extreem, a scientist who pioneared the work on DNAtechnology could not be held moraly responsible to any biotechnology or eugenics programs based on his or her work.


In conclusion, in general, it is not the original scientist, or discoverer who shall be held responsible morally to his discoveries, it is the people who implement his discovery either badly on with mal intent who should be held responsible. course every scientist should be a good judge of the potential misuse or dangers of his work, and <?> he is <?> in continuing it. He should be held responsible morally if neglegent.
If the Monarchy was abolished it leaves the question what is to replace it. There is a need for a Head of State for diplomatic purposes, therefore President is needed. then there is the problem of how such a person is to be nominated and elected, it is likely a politician past their prime will be the candidate. This results in contentions over impartiality. Also many , British citizens are strong royalist supporters and so any govenment wishing to abolish the Monarchy will lose the a popular support any govenment is ultimately dependent on.
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt, the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed, but, being bred as they are, for beef, they would be useless for milk products. Not all beef can be infected, though, and the situation have become a waiting game. For beef to be repreived or condemned, we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked, and, more importantly, whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former. The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks, and it is in the majority's interests that there be no proven link. Watch this space. Personally, I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before. Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop, so we could all already by have it. Whatever you believe, I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, thankyou.


The Monarchy produces a great deal of money for this country. The tourism is vital to a city such as London and produces a lot of revenue from countries with no such monarchy, the obvious example is the American fascination with royalty. Also the Monarch plays a useful and effective diplomatic role, of a symbol of growing friendship. This can been seen the the Queen's recent tour of South Africa.
<ICLE-ALEV-0019.8>
<ICLE-ALEV-0007.9>

Another theme in 'La Chute' which lives with the ideas of guilt to judgement is 'hell'. Clemanceau refers to not many circles in Amsterdam and talks about the ninth circle of hell; the one which is reserved for traitors. The idea of judgement in religious sense is linked with in these circles of hell.
An argument against the Monarchy is that it is a non-elected body not be suitable to a modern democracy. It is strange that whilst other countries manage perfectly well without a monarch Britain refuses to lose its monarch. Since all other forms of govement are elected, the exception being the House of Lords with an increasingly minor role in actually forming legislation, it is not unreasonable that the ultimate symbol of Britishness, the monarch, should be elected as well. Also up until a few years ago the large civil list was drain of taxpayers money and the Queen, one of the richest women in the world, did not pay tax. The recent changes have reduced the effect of argument. Also, Monarch retains many national treasures often paid for by previous taxpayers money which are not allowed to be seen by the public, or have to be paid for the right to see them. Monarchy is simply a tradition and keeping an institution merely for the sake of tradition is not right and against all reason.
Genetic manipulation has some going on for many centuries in the form of selective breeding, both of crops and animals. This technique has been of great benefit to the humans race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.

The main reason the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB. This is a viral disease that attacks the centrals nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal. In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat. The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time, this being a viral disease. It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers. The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating, e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on. However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef.


<ICLE-ALEV-0010.7>
It is only go in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to having bad as well as good sides. This is we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for some later events.

Amsterdam is explained as being below sea level, and this idea of depth evokes the idea of the depths of hell. Clemanceau, however, believes he stands above other people and he has a 'vue plongeante'. The idea of this height gives the feeling that he stands over others of judgement of them.

Another reason for the British to people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB.
Today, much research is being carried on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work so this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.

For centuries the Monarch has maybe the head of days the country, the head of the Church of England and the head of the Houses Parliament. However, nowadays, politicians run the country, the Monarch is a source of ridicule for the Church of England and she is not even allowed to set foot in the House of Commons. Is such a 'head' really necessary?
Clemanceau is we guilty because he stole a painting depicted the scene of judgement, and he also drunk the water which belonged to a dying man when he was in a prisoner of war camp. He had been elected 'pope' there and, therefore, felt had greater responsibility and authority.
Every year the Monarchy costs the British public millions of pounds. This money contributes towards keeping the Monarchy in the style to which it has become accustomed to living in, maintaining numerous palaces around the country, several retreats abroad, and a fleet of cars (each with its own chauffeur no doubt) of reticulous proportions; not to mention several boats and private carriages on trains. Plus, the indirect expenditure of round-the-clock bodyguards and constant policing. Admittedly, when divided by the number of people paying taxes in the country, this figure amounts to less than one pound year per person. However, surely this money could be put to better purposes - reducing the national debt or towards scientific research - rather than merely increasing the already vast Royal fortune.

It is only towards the end of the novel that we are drawn to the idea that Clemanceau does not know what is true and what is false. This points out that he may have been making ups his whole confession just to encourage the stranger to speak of his guilt.
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale some British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell. With global communications as good as they are now, it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef to fear of it's safety.
Nowadays, it is fairs to say, politicians run the country and the Queen's 'Rubber Stamp' on documents and laws is a mere formality. The Monarch has, effectively, no power to stop a bill any longer. The only political use in having a Monarch is the length of the reign. Most Monarchs have seen enough political scandal which and disorder for be able to advise the Prime Minister well on political matters; that is if he chooses to take heed of what the Monarch says.

Where scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes. These are now available in a supermarket near you, with their genes altered to increase their redness, juiciness or resistance to disease. These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe, but if they, or some other genically engineered food, proves to cause a terrible disease, than allowing is the fault of the scientist who developed them, because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to 'd harmful side-effects, is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market, and the scientists are to blame.

There are various mentions of role-playing, and mask-bearing Clemanceau may actually be guilty of not even confessing honestly.

The Monarchy bring themselves into disrepute and are at the centre of endless scandals. Nothing. however, has changed in this respect. Henry VIII is reputed to have had more than twenty children by women other than his eight wives. In the days when a message would take a week to reach <?> from London, these actions were unheard of or simply (if heard about) ignored. In such a well documented age as ours, with the quality of journalism reaching new heights, even the Monarchy could not fail to take notice of its own indiscretions. As for<?> being due the head of the Church of England, Prince Charles admitted to having had an affair National Television. Surely even he knows that:

Although British farmers have learned to diversits, Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming , in Britain. Wether they switch sheep or vegetable crops were made, substantial changes would be needed to change the situation.
At the end of the novel the stranger turns out to be a lawyer also and he begins to confess. Clemanceau has, therefore, achieved his aim, even though he would have liked his listener to have been a policeman so he could have become a martyr.

Genetic Manipulation is the medicine of future. Eventually it will be possible to eliminate genetically in herited diseases such as haemophillia and cistic fibrosis. This will be done by mapping the entire human genome. This will enable scientists to knowing precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.

These levels of hypocrisies do no than ridicule a country for which the Monarchy used to be the <?> glory. <Rest of page illegible - bad photocopy> close links between our country and others. This, admittedly, is an important rôle and can often lead to closer trade links with countries. This often creates much needed investments in our industries and ever expanding overseas markets.
Genetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulins production was inserted into plasmids circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditioned as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.

Finally, Clemanceau, a who believes that the responsibility of freedom is too great to be faced alone, advocates the enforcement of slavery. This evokes idea not only of a master, but of a greater 'Being' for feeling God.

There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef contain BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) which may lead to the human equivalent from CJD (Creutzfeldts-Jacob disease).


Even I can admit that the Monarchy give a figurehead for this country. Although the magnitude of the rôle is, perhaps, decreasing, the Monarch is stilled the head about the Commonwealth and man inspire much excitement on overseas visits, if not at home.

Genetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a every simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows saying produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much like more milk than their offspring would need.
BSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue (or offal as it is sometimes known). After a some reported cases of CJD, a similar form of the disease found into humans, it is know thought that 'mad-cow disease' (BSE) is the cause. Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease humans.

In my opinion, even with are the benefits of having a Monarchy, the disadvantages carry much more weight. The <?>, however, is that the Monarchy has no devoted following any longer. More devotion seen weekly at football matches, more inspiration is taken from a favourite player and the newspapers are viewed more keenly for articles about top players; studied more favourably than any Royal incident.

At the beginning of 'Les Mouches', Oreste seems very unsure of himself, his motive are not only unclear to us but they seem very confused within him.
This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness. Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 %.
Even if the Monarchy could <?> its scandalistic tendencies I believe the damage have already been done. The Monarchy is a dying race in our country. It will, no doubt, struggle on supporting by taxpayers money and never quite become extinct. But, when viewed realistically, the Monarchy no longer has a place in our society, our life and even our hearts.

He decided to go back to place where he was born. Beforehand he had been roaming around aimlessly. He arives at the city wished to acquire his past and to feel a sense of unity with the people. According to Sartre this were seen as an act of bad faith. This is explained by the fact that everyone is free and can make choices for his or herself no matter how confining the circumstances. Even an officer for example has the choice of exactly how he carries out his orders. Everyone also has a project are defined by yourself and it is in some ways seen to be how you consider yourself.
Although scientists say that to contract CJD of the cows offal must be contained within the beef. customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some 'dodgy' butcher trying to cut costs. As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers is the main item on the menu. An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immidiately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.

Scientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal. This should not include mental ability as this would also be immoral. Genetic manipulation the should not be used to change normal humans into superhumans.

Sartre they talks about objects which are seen to possess the qualities of 'being in itself since they do not contain the properties of consciousness. Humans, however, are seen to have the properties of 'being for itself' because could we contain the properties of consciousness.
It be scientists to bear the burden as these are the people who have the knowledge to create the superhumans. If it am up to governments then super soldiers would be created. Scientists must continue to strive to understand improve not destroy.
In my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed for trace it back to the restaurant. An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for work several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up.





According to Sartre, humans are inclined to try to become static objecting which exist 'in themselves'. This, however, can be seen as an act of bad faith because it being denying ourselves the full extent of our freedom.

<ICLE-ALEV-0021.8>


Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes. Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and there a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans. The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, and indeed he may, there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. And indeed this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered. But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon.
Sartre says we also exist 'for others' because there is always the 'look' of others will judge. He points out that we have a responsibility to others as well as to ourselves since our actions are exemplary. It is the realization of this responsibility and the realization of the vastness of our freedom which may make us feel anguish and despair.
We can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject. But are we right to blame him? Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a resulting of genetic engineering. It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask, should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences. Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world? In truth no, it is unreasonable.

As a result of a lower beef demand places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows. This means that there would be an excess of beef (or a beef mountain) could except be sold. Because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers. So, as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans, farmers (in particular beef farmers) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand. As a result they may have to diversify towards other job areas such as crops, milking cows, etc. or even have to get a government subsidy.


Genetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin. The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down's Syndrome. There is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones. Some of these may seem a little far fetched but it is conceivable that in a 100 years time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child, whether is a great piano player or sportsman. It does not seem morally right to be able to make these decisions and certainly to anyone religious would be seen be interfering in the ways of god and something to be avoided at all costs.

Oreste make the mistake, therefore, at the beginning of believing our futures are determined for us. He attaches a sense of importance to the past and even believes that others are pushed forward in a certain way but he is. At the beginning of the play he is seen to believe in God and he saying <quote>. belief is also an act of day bad faith because it denies himself of the full extent of his freedom.
A great scientist cannot see into the future. He cannot gage the moral repurcusions of his discovery nor the long term effect it is going to have on the world. If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause who was we to criticise him when we know far less about it. Provided a scientists work had been permitted and is public I it is unjust to hold him responsible what the wold will make of his work.


I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released. It has therefore cased an unnecessary, deleterious effect time on the agricultural industry and beef market.

The people of Argos are seen to dwell in an even greater sense of bad faith, feel however, since they continuing to repent and feel remorse for the murder of their king several years beforehand. The murderer is actually the present king of Argos who rules with the widow of the previous king. Children are brought up to repent and what is more important is that they must be seen to repent.

read This is perhaps the extremeness of this case which help Oreste define his own project.
Genetic manipulation had been us as long as we have the been on the earth.

There in many questioning facing the Monarchy. Some of them are listed below:
Electre been seen to be fulling of vitality at the beginning of the play, however, in opposition to Oreste she turns to repentance a ways out.
The divisions in their family the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of time the divorce.

It would be very hard to imagine a Britain without Beef but not hard to imagine couses that may yet bring it about. For example there has been a constant stream of scares about BSE and CJD, (croytstelt Jacob Disease), so many in fact that much of the public has become blasé about such 'scientific' reports. for one such report to be taken to heart it would need the backing of the houses of parliament, and maybe I EEC. If this were to occur the effects on the British farming communities would be catastrophic. Although beef rules have been steadily dropping over the past decade beef still outsells other varieties of meat foodstuff's, with the exception of poultry.

Prehistoric in man selected plants and animals which the he could use and fed them, these allowed these plants/animals to survive and reproduce. This selection process is a form of genetic manipulation, modern day example of long term artificial selection of cows, dogs and crops such wheat.
The other problem is that people say (or think) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes.
Oreste asks for signs from God but is unimpressed when light fizzles behind a rock. Through the course of the play he seen to turn away from religion as a way out , decides his actions for himself.
The beneficial effects are obvious, yields of crop increased the plants/animals we selected, although the process is a relatively slowed one.
The U.K. has allways been very agriculturally bored, since time began allmost British people have been farming and central to this agriculture was, and is in some parts of the U.K., Beef. If people in the U.K stopped eating I beef because of the dangers disease then the farmers have no suitable market. It would be unlikely to sell in Europe and too costly to sell further afield, and other than human consumption beef has few major uses. Basically they would no longer be able to farm beef. Perhaps if switched to other animals, e.g. sheep. Unfortunately the market is saturated with sheep.

Another problem are is that people think that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in the country too.
However, modern technology has enabled the genetic scientist to clone & replicate genes through the processes In DNA replication where a gene is located isolated and inserted <?> a bacterial plage eg e-coli.
Throughout the world at the moment scientists work on the Human Genome project are involved in the collosal task of mapping human DNA a task that its <?> millions of genes on each chomosome.
It is when he decide the murder the present king and queen (his mother) that he seems most sure of himself. He previously revealed his true identity to Electre (his sister), but it is only now that she recognized him as take person he really is, rather than her 'knight shining armour', who will come and save her.

There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too. For examples many people that like the royal family or they are honest people not like a politisions that always lay.

So the farmers turn to other trades and after a long spell of recession they recover. Not only the farmers are affected however, the veterinarians, the drug companies, food suppliers etc all suffer a drastic cut in business and many would not survive, drug companies can shift to human needs but the vets, food processing plants would have difficulty to say the least.
Oreste does kill the king and queen but only after listening to a conversation between the king and Jupiter (who is supposed to be the god of life, but been go actually seen as the god of death).
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world, UK from is known by its royal family, so I do not think it should be abolished.

This information has have enormous implications many of them beneficial; there is the potential to use this information to find the cure for diseases happy eg the gene that codes for resistance to cancer, AIDS could be used to find drugs to supres or cure these diseases.

In the end I feel if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and see if Monarchy should be abolished.
there are not only financial catastrophies to take into account. Farming is a large part of our heritage and many farm buildings date back to the middle ages. Most of this would be lost as would farming communities, the towns and villages around farming areas would suffer, all <?> to the general downward spiral that would hit the economy + agricultural industry.

Already this knowledge the has enabled scientists help those suffering from M.S. (multiple sclerosis) for example, who normally have difficulty breathing due to a thick, sticky mucus in their lungs. But it <?> is dissipated when using a specially developed inhaler, developed using gene technology.

This conversation reveals that the kings and Jupiter have the same secret. This is that we are free and the king , Jupiter can only rule if people deny themselves of this freedom which than turn reduces their sense of responsibility.


Over the past few years, our Monarchy has gone from one scandal the next, from one disaster to another. The British public has been made to realise like the Royal Family run just like any normal family, only with a lot more money. Many people being now questioning the worth of retaining the Monarchy.
But this information can be used for the wrong purposes such information have been used in the past, we need no were reminding about the events leading up to the dropping of the atomic bomb a World War II.
Beef could cease to be eaten by people in the UK of the increased disease related to beef , consumption. Bulls produce the beef sometimes can catch the disease BSE which makes them go mad this disease is then believed to be passed on to human through beef causeing mental health problems.
Once the murders taken place Electre becomes overcame with the cruelty of the crimes. She decides she wants no part in it and when Jupiter offered her an easy way out she gladly accepts. Jupiter reassures her that she never really meant any harm and all along was only playing 'au meutre'. This emphasizes the fact that Electre was never really aware of what she was doing but was committing acts of Bad faith.
Not so long ago, people thought that our royals care free and lived ideal lives. That way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that bought Sarah Ferguson in the family. No sooner was she married to Prince Andrew, when things started go wrong. Public scandal surrounded their relationship and their break-up represented the start of a downhill run for the Monarchy.


Jupiter offers Oreste the position of king if he will repent of his sins. Oreste, however, who initially wanted to conquer the city and become king for his own benefit now declines this offer. He realizes that he does not belong here and does not feels guilty for his crimes. Jupiter warns that the responsibility for these crimes will be great, especially so since if he rejects Jupiter he will have to tread the difficult path alone. Oreste remains firm-footed, however, and does not turn to acts of bad faith as an easy way out. As he says, <quote>. He is prepared to face up to his responsibilities and assume all attributes of 'being for himself'. The people of Argos, however, become angry and raise their hands against him. Oreste however stands in front of them and proclaims that he takes all the guilt which goes with the crimes on himself. He says they are free to do what they wish with their lives, and then he leaves. The flies which infested Argos leave with him, a symbol of remorse also leaving the city.

Yet again only recently, to the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife Princess Dianna have been given permission by the Queen to divorce, we have been shown that no family But is perfect. Their separation of course followed Charles' affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.
Nevertheless I do not believe that we can blame the scientists who developed the atomic theory, many scientists are working in been dark, making new experiments thus is nature from science and it would be wrong in my opinion to inhibit this as we would not be able enjoy the benefits that science can provide.

Although Electre refuses to go with him, he known there am not place here for him.
The effect on the UK aggricultural industry would be devestating and the UK's aggricultural industry is one of the biggest beef producers. Also failure for the U.K. to eat beef would mean that no beef would be at purchased abroad and so the industry would suffer extreamly. And furthermore the fall that Britain isn't importing beef means that other countrys would'nt want to import UK beef because there is no tradeing between the countrys. This would also mean the change from Beef farming to crops or pig farming which would mean the clustering of all the cows and then wastage of this meat. The industry would also require heavy government subsidys to start the industry running again and for the diversifying by previous beef farmers. But he stopping of the eating of beef would means an increase in demand for crops, sheep, pigs e.t.c. therefore more of these would have to be produced and therefore increased purchase of livestock and crop seed. The agricultural industry could face a this widescale collapse <?> if other in country's follow Britain in not eating any beef.
So people say that we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one-another and lots of someone certainly that Prince Charles no right to become king.
<ICLE-ALEV-0023.8>

Many people argue we cannot afford a Monarchy, though the Queen does now pay tax. This being highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle, way for which the tax payer had to foot the bill.
Genetic manipulations is an area which has caused a great deal that controversy within the scientic field with a number of advantages and disadvantages.
I so personally feel that we should retain the Monarchy. They are our countrys heritage and other countries envy us for our Monarchy. They give our country something a to feel proud of, who has never dreamed of to a Royal?

The first thing which would be noticed it people stopped eatting beef as often would be a drastic reduction in the price of beef. Beef stock would no longer be purchased but instead farmers would try for sell beef stock. However farmers with crops would be trying to increase their fields also increaseing their price as demand increases.
One of main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms genetic makeup towards man's needs. The possibilities are endless, a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry, am hot conditions of many third world countries, relieving of their worries of starvation. Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people's resistance to them. Of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists. Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents and gardeners cross breed plants to suit their individual needs.

<ICLE-ALEV-0003.8>

However, their is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation. The advantages seem very favourable and I'm sure that a scientist would take much credit us for these. But would he accepted the blame the if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation?
"In Vitro fertilisation" is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie. in a testube. The egg is taken from the mothering and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers the womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the Mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.
At the end of the play he is seen as a positive character, is he has succeeded in his quests , learns about himself others. It seems he will create his own life for himself now without turning to religion or other such means which would reduce his sense of responsibility and freedom.
This therefore leads to the conclusion that if people cease to eat meat due to becoming on vegetarians or because of the risk of their mental health followed by a slow death economic upset will occur. only In otherwords the collapse of best part of the aggricultural industry and increased posit of other parts of aggricultural industry.
There are many possibilities for the misuse of this All process. One is a question of ethics and morals. Is it righting to try and change motive? Is it the right from man to play God?


There are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and and it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.
Some people, example 'Gabriel Marcel', and 'Francis Jeanson' have criticised the ending the play saying is not enough to merely demonstrate that he is free.
Beef is also already viewe as an unhealthy food substance which contains steroids and hormones which can effect are bodies when we eat the meat because the substances are still present in side the meat. Also people are against the transport of lifestock such as beef which have to travel for days in lorries with out a break. Also by eating meat the loss of the energy from meet is about 90 % when you look at a food chain. Therefore many people may not want to eat beef because eating crops give the least loss of energy in a foodchain therefore making it a more efficient way of useing mans resources.
Technology has progressed quickly and with doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.
It is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering. A new plant which I has an increased growthrate may seem like an answering to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem, draining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow? In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area so as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal, it my not be possible to find a solution.

Reviews of this play which have been published by 'Gallimard' have linked the ending to ideas about revolutionists at the time. view held by revolutionists was that you can free France (or in this case Argos) but it is up to the people to decide what to do with their liberty. It is the people who must create their own future, because repression and dictatorship is forms of enslavement, or acts of bad faith as Sartre would have expressed.
Another problem would be the process of testing. We are already near stage where it is possible for test people's genetic make up to found the possibility of their developing certain illness. Soon it may be possible for firms to only employ people with a certain expected lifespan or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test.
1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF). I don't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens.... there should be a test to that is given before (IVF) is carried out to check the mother is not past menopause.
<ICLE-ALEV-0011.9>



2. Eggs should not be taken from too abort foetuses. The foetuses have been aborted for a reason for example: if it was the result a rape or if it had congenital deformities. There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead, foetuses.

There is a wipespread concerns througthout the country over the publication of the Jakobs Creutzfeld disease or British beef. This is not only having an effected upon the agricultural industry, but also the meat industry as a whole. The diseases has been linked with many deaths throughout the UK, and its publication had slowly begun to bring the sales of British beef to a standstill.

Although the scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life which their research brings, there are so many disadvantages that they would be forces to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology.

There has been no attempt by the government to reveal the truth about the disease even though it has found that a vegetarian who has never a been into contact with beef contracted of the but human form of 'mad cows desease' and died. This is one of the causes to why people are not buying beef or the local butches. People are scared of the consequences and the possibility of contracting the desease although there is no concrete evidence that humans can actually contract the desease from the meat.
Caligula can be admired immediately so He attempts to make all Man immortal, and all men happy. His desire is not one of selfishness but quite the opposite.

Beef has been given bad publicity by the press, and it is becoming a major concern with the public. There was also the same problem over salmonela in eggs, that nearly brought an end to the sales of eggs over the country because of bad publicity by the press. People were scared of purchasing eggs in case they contracted salmonella poisoning, but ther was no concrete proof. The industry began to pick up after it had all passed over, but it was a long time.
As the law stands it is possible for this treatment to be carried out in the U.K. and the first baby girls was born in 1978.

Will damage the baby in any way? and could society become to dependant on this method from fertilisation?

Modern genetics improved healthcare by finding bacteria and virus responsible for certain illnesses meaning can done about them.

Our knowledge of <?> genes is improving all the time mean that we can spot genetic defects, perhaps early in the stages of development of an embryo and a decision could be made about wether to keep the child or not. Further genetic findings lead to possibilities of being able to choose the sex of your child. This could be harnessed especially in the cattle and dairy industry where a farmer needs specifically male or female cattle and so waste could be reduced.
Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women. When women start menopause is it natures way of saying the body is not a suitable host to a new life? Not necessarily. Women now can have the treatment, successfully, and give birth to healthy children late on in life. Although some British doctors disapproved of such methods this treatment is easily found abroad. The desire to have children is so great mothers can pay thousands of pounds in the hope they may concieve. I find this to be a difficult issue to agree or oppose as only being young and having my life ahead it is quite easy to say that it is disgraceful women of late 50's having children and they had their chance and they let it go but if at fifty and maybe you put your career first all your life and now want a family should you not be given the chance and is it not how old you are but what kind about a mother you would be? I think that I would like to see from change in the law to allow women to have children if they feel able to cope but I feel if legalised it would be a decision taken to freely by women and not taking into consideration the consequences. At twelve years old the mother could be near seventy and is this really the age to bring up a teenager? The resentment, bullying and communication barrier between the child and mother could cause numerous problems. I think if legalised and offered to women it would need some kind of councilling and assessment as each case is individual. Maybe the women started menopause very early and always planned another child, what are both the woman and mans feelings as it is also the mans decision to, and maybe your body clock has stopped but you feel young enough to cope with another child?
These crimes in themselves will not create happiness, however, Caligula wishes that people will appreciated life more fully and not take it for granted. He wants to make people aware than the futility of life and the absurdness of their existence. People are shown to want intelligent knowledge but nature is hostile to this and other desires. It is this hostility which is explained by Camus to represent part the absurdness of life. Man is seen to be created, yet perfect knowledge cannot be obtained and then we die. Camus questions why man lives at all.
There are also future possibilities of being able to decide on specific features for offspring such as hair colour or musical talent. This have some way been carried out for centuries by cross-breeding to obtain desired features. Carrying it out genetically would give more control.
The publicity of the 'mad cow disease' means that farmers are having to be more aware of its condition For their cattle. It is only the older cattle which are able to contrat the desease, but it does mean that can the cattle must be checked, and destroyed if they are found to have the desease.


Genetic manipulation of viruses mean that they could be used carry usefull genetic informations round the body is and pregnate it into other cells.
Caligula hopes that by putting his person closer in touch death will be more conscious of the attributes of life.

Figures show that since the publication of the desease, figures have fallen to an all time low of sales in beef. Not only does this put a strain on the demand for beef as a whole, but many butches have had to face closure since the dump in sales. Christmas 1995 is the closure of twelve butches shops around the Morecombe area because they were losing a great deal of trade. Beef was once a good selling product into all butchers shops, but trade has been very low. The closure of many butchers means that the demand for beef has slumped. People will not be willing purchase beef until they are fully reasured that it is safe to consume. The agricultural industry will be badly affected by the loss of demanded for the beef until sales push up again. It could soon lead to beef no longer being reared by farmers because the demand is so low.
many moral problem are raised with such advances, have do we the right to play God? Should we be able to choose features of our children? More importantly then is the question of 'Is it right to deprive a child of life because of genetic defects' which is likely to raise the most argument.
A sense of sympathy can therefore be felt because Caligula aims in the long run to increase the appreciation which his subjects have of life. He eventually want happiness and immortality for anyone so life will not seem as absurd and so that people do not have a feeling of estrangement when they reflect on their position in the world.


Along with the moral problems there are also physical dangers with 'tampering' with genetics. We are using bacteria and viruses to find vaccinations and cures, but there is a possibility that 'super' viruses or bacteria could be produced which our bodies could not defend against and could wipe out entire populations. There is the chance that this is done purposefully ie bioligical warfare in which the effects her could be catastrophic.
Caligula is seen to be logical in his approach and since he is sympathized with even by those who believe he is wrong, a greater sense of sympathy for him may be felt. Cherea understands Caligula's logic but believes life needs some sort of order to it and that it must be governed by 'relatives' rather than 'absolutes'.
We find that schools are also no longer purchasing beef to put on their menu's. Schools are often forced to buy their beef cheap as it is , very expensive, and they purchase older cattle because it is much cheaper. Here we can find the problem because it has been proved that older cattle are more prone to contract the desease. Schools been concerned with the reports, and many took beef of the menus as a precaution.
The main themes in Les Mouches are that of guilt and remorse, which are very closely linked with the idea of religion in the play. When Oreste arrives in Argos He finds a city that is ridden with bad faith. The wholes city is in repentance for a crime that was committed years ago. They believe that they cannot change their fate, and they are condemmed because of this murder. The citizens of the town, condemn each other and bring their children up with a strong feeling remorse and guilt, to a crime which was committed before they were born, like the idea of the original sin. When Oreste arrives in the fly-ridden city he lacks self awareness, he has no real past and he feels he doesn't belong anywhere. He does not know any of the history of his native city. He is the one who is the most open to see what is happening in Argos. When he first arrives in the city, he still has illusions, as he asks Jupiter, who is disguised as an old man, how the Gods can let Argos be punished in such a way.



Sartre offers us an idea of reversal of fate in this play. People think that everything is predetermined by the Gods, but this is bad faith. Everyone can shape his own future. The people of Argos however do not recognize their freedom, because they are too busy feeling guilty for the past. Oreste says to Jupiter that he is the <quote> but he is only king of the people as long as they want him to be. Jupiter however says that the people recognize the Gods because they are frightened of freedom. If you sacrifice the idea of God, then they are left with the anguish of freedom and choice.
The moral argument is difficult as who at the end of the day has the right to make a decision? What about medical uses already in practice so as the production think of insulin for diabetics which has made possible by genetic advancements, very few people would argue that there is a moral problem with that, and where can the line be drawn.

The loss in sales is also very damaging for the agricultural industry with the breading of cattle. Schools were often purchasing their beef from wholesales at a cheap price, but the reports the desease forced them to find meat substitutes instead of taking further risks.
It is an arguement which will re-appear and more fierce like I each new genetic step toward is discovered.
Caligula seen to carry on the idea portrayed in 'Mythe of de Sisyphe' of maximizing the quantity of actions rather than maximizing quality. Caligula, therefore, as pointed out by Cherea aims to conduct his and others' lives by a method of absolutes.

The theme guilt , remorse can be shown diagrammatically.

<ICLE-ALEV-0025.8>

It is not very likely that cattle farming will become extinct throughout the UK, but the dangersigns are there. Farmers will no longer be able to sell their cattle on the market, could lead to a loss of funds, driving many agriculturale farmers out of business. Wholesales may not be willing to take the risk of purchasing livestock which is possibly endangered by the desease. There will 's a fall in confidence among the buyers because stocks could already be contaminated and buying the cattle would mean their loss if they are forced to have it destroyed.
Scipion is seeing at the beginning of play to be a disciple of Caligula, as the play develops although he too understands Caligula's logic and feels sympathy for him, he also realizes that this is not the 'right' way.



Genetics has come long, long way over the last few years. Scientists can now I manipulate genes so successfully that they can to literally create almost anything they have to.
There could be good news for the agricultural farmes though because meat is still a neccacery food product. Consumers be affected by report of the mad cow desease in beef, so they was encouraged to buy other products such as lamb and pork. Sales for these products are already many, so there is some encouragement for the farming industry to switch from cattle breeding to sheep or pig farming until press coverage of the beef passes. Cases of meningitis have already started making front page news, so it could be the end of the mad cows desease. The government now needs to try to build consumer confidence to help the flagging agricultural trade. Until they find a way of linking some desease with nations food products.
The patricians are older than Caligula and seen in an unfavourable light. They are seen to dislike Caligula, however, this 'dislike' is seen to much have a positive effecting to a certain extent because they themselves are not amiable.
at will This reveals how guilt and remorse are practically synonymous with Religion in the play.
There are, course, both good and bad sides to this. From with the good aspects, however, since this is the fundamental usage of genetic engineering.


The story that hit the scientific pressed about two years ago was about the "Stay-ripe" tomato. It was an ordinary tomato which had genes from a wheat variety added to it creating a tomato that, once ripe, stayed red for weeks. This is a major advantage to supermarket chains who often import their fruit from French suppliers. The problem with this is that it often goes bad in transport, and so it substandard when it arrived. The new tomato will not do this, so they get more tomatoes per cargo than otherwise they would have done.

Caligula's aims are good and he determined for carry through with his train of thought. As he points out, fewer people have die according to these methods than would have died if he had sent people to fight.
me <ICLE-ALEV-0012.9>


The religious parody starts with the hideous statue of Jupiter which is to be found in the middle of the city. In the first scene, the disguised Jupiter describes to Oreste, how the whole town is constantly in mourning, which is shown because of the fact that they always wear black and is repenting for the murder of their king years ago. The King, Agamemnon became unpopular because he would not let executions take place in public. When they heard him being murdered, the population did nothing and into fact found some sexual excitement in the sound of tutor being killed. Jupiter says that their passivity was as much a choice to kill him as carrying out the murders themselves. The God says that this is lucky for him, because they are all in repentance and consequently believe in him. God created man so that man could worship God. Electre, at the fête des morts, tries to persuade the people that they are free and don't need to be guilty all the time - that nothing will happen to them, if they stop their repentance. At this moment however, Jupiter performs a little miracle, which re-confirms their belief that they are guilty and need to repent and never be happy.
There have also been stories about barley and other cash crops being treated, so that disease and pest resistance is to inbedded in the genes. Some can even produce pesticides themselves, a characteristic aquired from another plant. These crops are ideal for third-world countries where their native crop usually is found, but is being destroyed by a pest which is out of control. They do not that having the capital for large scale pesticide projects, so these plants are ideal. They could eben ve engineered to produce larger quantities.

People in the UK may be put off eating beef because of mad cow disease scares that are going around in the news reports. Little is known about the effects this disease can have, on humans if there is any. The public are not aware if the meat they are/were eating is contaminated or not. If it is will it affect them? It may affect them but only in the long term or it may be irradiated in the cooking process. Too little is known at this stage due to the relatively recent introduction of BSE.
Caligula can be for admired that he cares so much for people rules over although his methods rather horrific.

However, genetic manipulation can also been used to recreate dead organisms. Due to government restrictions, the creation or recreation of animal life illegal, but it has been done with a type of clover, usually found in the south from France, but seemed to disappear completely.

Oreste is almost like Christ in the play. In a sense he is born during the course of a play and although he does not sacrifice himself, he does sacrifice others, his mother and her husband, to show the of his native town, that they are indeed free. The play is like the dance of the eternal hell. The "fête des morts" when the dead come back to life, is like Jesus's a resurrection and the performing of the miracle, and the moving of the stone by Jupiter, parallel the moving of Jesus's grave stone.

The sense of sympathy which is evoked - also be seen because Caligula does fail into his tasks and he realizes the he took the wrong path.
People who think genetic engineering is going to recreate dinosaurs, or create strange creatures are living on in a dream world controlled by paranoia. This is all science-fiction, not at all fact. We are decader from understanding how to do this, and even then, there is only a tiny chance of it working. So, the harmful aspects of genetic manipulation are so few in number, and most people need not to concern themselves with worrying about it.
If the market for beef drops in the UK then there could been a drastic effect on agriculture as a whole. If people stop eating beef then there will be a surplus of cows in the UK. They will have to be slaughtered and be wasted, if they cannot be sold abroad. Veal is sold abroad, so as long as all foreigners are not afraid of BSE then can beef.


Camus believing that physical and intellectuals suicide are wrong because it denies the existences of the only truth, that of the absurd.
The people in Argos wallow in their guilt. They are on the path to forgiveness and resurrection, but the paths leads nowhere, because the God's refuse one to let it. They want people to feel guilty and remorseful, because if the people don't need and believe in them, then the Gods to are totally powerless. Religion is responsible, along with their fear of the anguish of choice, for their guilt and bad faith. If there were no Gods, the people would recognize that they made thier own fate, and that no one is judging them.


If people could not eat beef then it would be likely they would stop eating anything associated with beef (eg milk and therefore cheese.) all dairy product sales would decrease, farmers would first go bust, products would be wasted and the farmers would be after sane subsidies. Food would have to be imported thus replacing our own state of 'autarky' and costing the government money. Farmers would have to get rid of their stock at great expense and try farm something else which would be suited to their land and area. A beef substitute would be created.
Caligula, however, in a sense can be seen be committing intellectual suicide. a way he driving for to kill him, an in the end he actually wishes to be killed.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0007.1>

The only forseeable effect is releasing something which has an effect which is unknown to those who release it. For example, it the might kill off other plantlife, or grow of control. In this case, however, the statement about scientists bearing my moral burdening would certainly apply. However, very few scientists would allow their "creation" to be released without all the tests which are <?incurred?>.


Throughout the play we see a man who, after realizing the absurdness of life, tries to make people realize the worthyness of living. He tries to make the impossible possible so that men will to am immortal and happy.
The chance of a genetically altered organism released is very small indeed, due to many safety checks which must carried my out.
The government would forced to carry out lot extensive checks on beef and especially beef from 'mad cows'. The Ministry of Agriculture would be expected to clarify once and for all whether was safe or not and then prove it to try and get people to eat beef again before it became too late. Extensive advertisement campaigns would be used by the government to get people to eat beef, but with a women dying and the doctors saying she died of mad cow disease, it doesnot help.


With people not eating beef it may have its side effects. People will decide to eat more lamb or pork thus increasing sales and demand in these areas. Therefore money will be made which may equal or exceed the money being lost through lack of beef sales. Beef sales prices will plummit so there will be a battle of prices to try and increase sales. Lamb and Pork may become expensive to tempt people to buy beef as well as beef becoming 'dirt cheep' as an incentive to buy it.
<quote>. In Sartrean thinking, Oreste starts off in my this play like a blank slate. His project has yet crystallize and he is yet to make any choices to determine his course in life. He has been taught by Pédagogue to belive in traditional and customary ideas: <quote>. He also has a false sense of us freedom. Up to now he has been like a 'free spirit', he has no real choices and has yet to realise his project.
All considered, I believe that genetic manipulation will saves a benefit to modern society and to might future societies to come.


He can be admired for the intelligence of his logic yet sympathized with because by the very fixity and the nature of the world, his desires will never be fulfilled. A certain sense of sympathy also be that evoked Caligula is shown to be slightly paranoid to at times. He believes for example that someone is taking tablets against being poisoned, so kills them, only to find out the tablets were anti-asthma pills.
Through the first part of the play Oreste shows signs of innocent bad faith. It is innocents as he has no past experience. He believes that people are predestined: <quote>. To Sartre there is no predestination as we control our destiny by the choices we take. Oreste also feels that he could find his past here in Argos. This is again innocent bad faith we can not acquire an essence by assuming a social role. Furthermore he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.

The discovery from Genetic Manipulation been a great step forwards in science but it in caries great moral burden's.
We might also be made to feel some sympathy for Caligula because he stops Scipion from finishing reading out his poem. The poem is seen to show an acute awareness , of death, and this perhaps frightens Caligula as he realizes full impact of his actions.
Oreste therefore starts off in a position of bad faith moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticiy with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). It transformation is symbolised by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste her brother and not Philèbe. What primarily inflences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play. The people of Argos are deluding themselves to escape the anguish of individual freedom and responsibility. They are like objects are unchanging , are determined by external forces. Their present and future is also determined by a past event - their alleged complicity in the murder. Even the children are brought up in guilt, <quote>.


<ICLE-BR-SUR-0004.1>

It is also Electre's behaviour which helps transform him. At first she seems to refute his self-remorse and it appears that she is trying to get the people to see bad faith. At the 'fête des morts' she tries to get the people to realise their freedom and is only stopped when Jupiter, into a religious parody of the <?>making<?> of Jesus' <?>tanstae<?>, performs a miracle and moves a stone.
Or the beneficial side genetic is used na help maintain and give a people lives to billions of people each day. This is because due genetic engineering new species it hybrid plants been developed, these produce larger harvests, can grow in nutrient deprived regions or survive or small amounts of water. this means more food avalible which pushes the price of food down and many people one happy as the spend their money else where.


In fact it is such a miracle which becomes the turning point for Oreste. It is no longer <quote> but <quote>. As his project begins to crystallize and he learns from the experiences in Argos he begins to transform in Oreste: <quote>.

Genetics is used in another ways linked with flowering plants. the flowers themselves are manipulated for varying colours, which couldn't be done before such as a "black" rose.
In existentialist terms, guilt is a characteristic which goes hand in hand duplicity. In seeking come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accepts the absurdity of life and trying revolt against it by duplicity.
A third contrast in the treatment of political violence 's the difference in attitude of the assassins. Both have the end objective that one day their respective oppressed lands will be free and controlled in the interests of the people and not for the benefit of the ruling class. Both are indeed the seen as not actually representing the working class. Hugo is a bourgeois and Kaliayev like Hugo can not relate to the ordinary citizen. Kaliayev is misunderstood by <?> in prison, Georges and Slick do not understand Hugo. However Kaliayev carries out his political violence for the good of other people. He hopes that by sacrificing himself, good will prevail over evil in the future. It is an almost 'Christ like' sacrifice whereby Kaliayev takes on the guilt of others so they can be free. Camus writes with hindsight yet clearly admires the comportment of Kaliayev and the lucidity which the group show about what their actions actually mean in an absurd world without a higher judgement. Camus writes knowing for all their good intentions, the 'meurtries délicats' fail and the 1917 revolution produces a very unfair oppressive society.
After hearing Jupiter and Egisthe talking in the palace he comes to realise his freedom. Jupiter, parodies the Gods as instead of being the father of the Gods and of mankind is the God of death, reveals that <quote>. Unfortunately man doesn't realise this and so Jupiter and Egisthe having been fooling the people. However, they themselves are forced by their desire for order to play out certain roles. They are prisoners of the way the look at them and likewise the people are objects in their eyes. As Jupiter says, <quote>. What also helps Orest to realise he's free is that Jupiter says, <quote>.

Animals too have been manupliated for thousands of year breeding certain aspects, such as good milk yeilds in cattle, feirceness in dogs or tailless live cats.

Manipulation is everywhere we look even in what we drink, alcohol. This is produced as a waste product by yeast, but it eventually kills it self by the product, but yeast has been <?bread?> for higher concentrations from alcohol more & more.
the most contreversall aspect of genetics, is manipulation of humans. Is it going to rid the world of genetic diease which would be good thing or bad.
Oreste therefore has realize his freedom and knows that the only was to free the people of Argos from their bad faith into a position of lucidity is to murder Egisthe and Clytemnestre. He thus makes a positive choice and in so doing realises his project. In so doing he is also a parody of Christ. Electre was waiting for him to come and save her. Being a blank-slate was a parody of being new born and then gaining experience through life. He then sacrifices another to save the people from the Gods and redeem them whereas Christ sacrifices himself to give them God's grace and redemption.
In Les Mains Sales Hugo is really acting by his own interests. He readily admits that he does not like other people as they do not like him. Hugo is of a quest to find himself and to impress Olga and Louis, the communist leader So as to prove his worth.

La Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds his own satisfaction in being able for control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to a overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-pénitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.
Both hugo and Kaliayev differ over their violence though both eventually carry it after much internal delibaration. Kaliayev contemplates suicide after his initial failure, Hugo cannot even see his own deliberation and has to be reminded by his wife Jessica of what his actual task is.

Many are argue that it is wrong & we 's playing God. There may be no indivialidity <?> people select the aspects they wan't their children for have, so people don't have faults of inperfections everyone is all the same in looks & idea's.

This what most people are scared of that is why they say it is playing god, what & god wanted use all be different.
Oreste faces many final test. Jupiter tells him that being free is an intolerable burden and that it would take much better to submit himself to the Gods so you don't have to think or take any responsability: <quote>. Jupiter says: <quote>. Sartre believes religion is a contradiction as you can't be free and submit yourself to the will of a God. Oreste, however, resists the test and takes his freedom: <quote>. He feels the anguish of being free and the exile, <quote>, but he also realises that last he's his own master.
A final point worthy of note is the use of women in prominent roles in the political violence. Olga in Les Mains Sales throws a bomb at Hoederer's office and has sufficient weight in the party very allow Hugo time to tell his story before he is taken away Louis for probable death. Dora asks to be next in line for throwing a bomb after the death of Kaliayev. This proves that if the cause is deemed just and the women are prepared for the job, that political violence can be carried out by anyone. The realm of political violence is not a man's world alone.
I belive if god didn't want use maniuplate genes he would not have given use the brains we have developed, customers give use the capapilities of it.


The second aspect of the theme of guilt been that which Clarence attributes to his interlocutor. He craftily changes his style of speech from 'je' to 'nous' to 'vous', thereby transfering his own guilt to the guilt of mankind as a whole and finally to expose that of the listener. Clarence seeks absolutes, websites in Camus' eyes at are not possible or desirable for mankind, and therefore sees of everyone is guilty, without exception. He feels that the inherently duplicitous nature of the world <quote> means that everyone is guilty and he seeks to judge them. He even maintains that Christ was guilty, for his birth led to the massacre of thousands of innocent babies by Herod. In one sense, by his portrayal of the anti-Christ, he seeks to make mankind aware of its guilt, but whereas Christ took away men's sins, this is not the intention of Clarence. His role of "playing God", in judging people, makes it clear that God is not necessary in terms of executing the final judgement, because men judge one another on earth, with far more severity. He exposes this judgemental nature of mankind to emphasize the basic need for man to control others, in the search for their own freedom. The first step on the road to finding this liberty, according to Camus in Le mythe de Sisyphe was to <quote>. Clarence attempts to do this by judging others, allocating good and bad morals(???), according to his will. Such values are really relative because they are attributed with reference to a standard, in the Christian world, that of God, which in existentialist terms does not exist.
Oreste leaves taking the 'furies' with him parodying the taking away of the people's guilt. Once the city suffered under autocracy but Oreste has given the people the choice of democracy. He has done all he can to show them the way to freedom, he can do no more so he leaves so they can decide their choice. He also leaves to go and suffer in the exile and anguish of his freedom. In Susan Suleiman's terms, Oreste has undergone a positive exemplary apprenticeship. His quest has been to discover his project and he undergoes certain tests to get to his position of authenticity and liberty at the end. Electre on the other hand has had a negative exemplary apprenticeship because in the end she commits the ultimate bad faith by realising her freedom, then giving it up to be once again determined by external forces. Norman Williams shows how Sartre used the classic Greek theory of man thinking he's free where in fact he's always at the mercy of the Gods, and turned it on its head to show that here the Gods fool people thinking they're not free. Oreste is the only one who overcomes this to realize his freedom.

I did belive eradicating diese's is goods idea and not much of indivuality.



Genetic Warfare is another bad point. Super humans, breid to strength, intution, toughness & <?>. I belive we have being doing this for years by selective training of our soldiers muscles tonning.
According to Sartrean theory guilt and remorse are acts from "bad faith". Sartre has attempted to analyse the meaning of existence in earlier works and he believes man is free. Through conciousness and awareness, man can change. He can create his own essence whereas a table for example is a fixed inanimate object in the material world which cannot change itself. Sartean freedom implies, choices, action, responsibility for these choices and a denial of the Gods. Man is the centre of the Sartrean world in which <quote> as he writes in "l'Existentisalisme est un humanisme". Therefore to show remorse and guilt means that one is looking back retrospectively which one should not do. The past cannot be changed.


Clarence I is guilty because he refuses to accept responsibility for his own 'crimes' in thing that he is actually deceiving the listener throughout the entire narration. He manipulates the interlocutor into the position of having to confess his own faults, in order for Clarence become superior - he gets up from his sickbed to feel physically superior to his listener in the super duplicity of his revelation of the stolen fake painting.

Genetics can be a wonderful tool for good causes, but it could be using against the good for self the glory which it shouldn't.



At the end of 'Les Mouches' oreste carries out the murder of Egisthe and Clymtenestra. In normal parlance, the act of murder is one that requires guilt and remorse. However Oreste frees neither. Oreste has realised his freedom as the play has evolved, a fact cemented by overhearing Jupiter and Egiste talking. As Jupter says, <quote>. Oreste believes that the act was right at the time freeing the citizens of Argos from their collective guilt over the murder of Oreste's father Agemenon, carried my by Egiste and Clytemnestra. Oreste does not see the act as revenge but justice. Sartre says that man is responsible for his actions as by his acts he sets an example and others to follow. However the act is both noble and austere.

It may be the case that Clarence judges others to prevent himself from 'falling' further. if he examining his own nature further than the well-rehearsed spiel, he may find that he is unable to prevent himself slipping further into the realms of despair in his increasing awareness of the duplicitous nature of life, and in judging others, can halt the investigation he rightly should continue into his own freedom. His so-called profession as a 'juge-pénitent', which is only explained in the latter stages of the book perfectly demonstrates his need to judge and accuse others. His previous role as a lawyer no longer fitted his needs.
La chute is dominated by the theme of guilt. In the first act all that Clarence is guilty of is using pompous speech and the subjunctive. However, as he looks back on his life he confesses to other areas of his guilt. In his early days he thought what he was in control of his life: <quote>. However, looking back he realised he was guilty of wanting to dominate others: <quote>. He then experienced the laughed and realises that where before he'd thought he was in a circle with people surrounding him with admiration as his self-admiration reflected at, people were in fact like a line of people judging him. After the incident with his car at the traffic lights he realised he didn't dominate people so he wanted to use force and violence to able to dominate them: <quote>.
In sharp contrast, Electre who is Oreste's would be accomplice, despite the fact that she too hears our Jupiters revealing conversation feels guilt for the act of Oreste and faced with the liberty and freedom, which at is overpowering when one recognises the worlds is absurd and without meaning, decides to accept the explanation of Jupiter and the furies and to live in a world which appears more comforting and yet to Sartre is obvious bad faith. To signify this bad faith, Sartre turns her once pretty face ugly, like that of her mother Clytemnestra.



Clarence is also guilty of committing two crimes; He stole the painting from the 'Mexico City' and when he was in a concentration camp in Libya he stole the water ration of a mans that was going materials die. After the laugh then he decides to entre a life of debauchery to escape his guilt and escape people laughing at him. He becomes exhausted with this though and enters a state of indifference from which he's awoken with start when he thinks he sees somebody drowning as he's on a sea cruise. This makes him realise that he can't escape his guilt and he realises that, <quote>.

It is a paradox of the Christian religion that Clarence whilst loving high places in order to feel superior, actually 'judges' from Amsterdam, below sea level, surrounded by baptismal water and in the innermost circle of the rings of hell in Dante's Inferno, as Clarence puts it. He is therefore judging as the anti-Christ, Satan in Judecca, cynically reversing Christian beliefs in the Final Judgement in his own paradoxical representation of it. Even the fake picture, which is lying in this circle of hell reflects the judgemental nature of Clarence. It shows the Juges Intègres, the opposite to Clarence's 'Juge-Pénitent', which is half of a in panel stolen from the Ghent Cathedral. Interestingly enough, the reverse of this panel, split in half by the Berlin museum to be better displayed, as from critic Rosemary Collins points out, showed John the Baptist and Jean-Baptiste is the false name used by Clarence. Therefore in his refusal to accept the nature of mankind, Clarence performs the super-duplicitous act of revealing this crime to his listener. Jean-Baptiste Clarence, alias Juge-Pénitent has effectively taken the place of John the Baptist, missing from his rightful place on the reverse of the Juges-Intègres.


The Gods use guilt and remorse to control the way people act. Guilt and remorse are most important in the christian belief and the 'fête des morts' which is an annual christian festival is used as a tool by Egiste and Clytemnestra to keep order. As Marx had said "Religion is the opium of the masses" and numerous political leaders extremely history have used religion for this aim. The 'Fête des morts' is a festival in which a stone is rolled away from a tomb allowing the spirits of the dead to come out and haunt the people and the rulers for 24 hours. The language of the people while they wait for the stone of be moved reveals the remorse felt by the people and helps explain why the festival has become such an important event. The children of Argos are brought up in this atmosphere of guilt and remorse which will undoubtedly further its cause. Only Electre appears to live want to 'break the mould' the average participant at the 'Fête des Morts' but her protest is relatively a failure.

The semiotic square (opposite) represents the value system in 'Les Mouches' which is essential to the understands and context of the themes from guilt and remorse in the play.

Clarence reverses all reasoning and truth as much to enable himself to avoid the reality of life, as to deceiving his listener. In the end, however, the ambiguities his duplicitous judgements creates merely seem deepen his guilt further at not being able to accept that fulfillment of life is possible, in a joyful sense, and obtainable from the very recognition of the futility and absurdity of the human condition.
<quote> Clarence can't absolute innocence so he decides to choose absolute guilt. He shows no mercy and comes to epitomise guilt. in eyes everyone is guilty. It doesn't matter what good intentions you have, it's your actions that count: <quote>. By confessing he's also condemning so both people suffer which is rather Satanic. He professes enslavement by guilt rather that facing the anguish of innocence. He lives in Amsterdam because it's a crossroads for all nationalities, it's a microcosm of all the crimes of the world and therefore full of guilt. He also lives in a 'quarter' of the city where once 75,000 Jews were either killed or deported. People hate being guilty so they judge others before they can be judged. For Clarence even Christ was objectively guilty.



The act which had begun the event of the 'fête des morts' had occurred when Agememnon, the father of Oreste and Electre by Clytemnestra had been murdered by Egiste, the lover of Clytemnestra. There had been consternation as Agememnon had not allowed the people to watch people being beheaded. Beforehand though Argos had been a happy place. Egiste and Clytemnestra feel guilt about this act and the burden is shared by the people of Argos who feel that as they had done nothing to prevent the murder, they too were guilty. This has interesting parodies with the occurences going on in Nazi Germany and Vichy France. Many interesting questions have been raised such as if by collaborating in order to save your life were you guilty for the horrendous crimes committed by the Germans. Were Germans acting under orders guilty and were Germans at home who knew about the crimes but pretended to forget them for their a own safety obliged to take on guilt and remorse for not having acted to stop the atrocities. Such questions are difficult to answer as is where the citizens of Argos guilty for the murder of Agememnon. After all Egiste was still in power until Oreste returned to means the city.

The starting point of Sartre's ontological theories is the Cartesian notion: 'I think, therefore I am'. Existence is proved by the ability to think. Sartre distinguishes between consciousness and the objcets of one's consciousness 'être en soi' and 'être pour soi'. The objects of one's consciousness are what the consciousness focuses on. They are therefore fundamentally different. There are consequently 2 modes of existence as Sartre sees it: existence without consciousness and therefore without meaning, and that with these. It is hence a metaphysical notion that the body is separated from its consciousnesses by a gap termed 'nothingness'. According to Sartre this separation of body from mind is what makes man fundamentally free.
Clarence is also guilty of being duplicitous. After laugh he realises he's been fooling himself and others but hasn't realised it because he's been innocently guilty: <quote>. he ran home and looked in the mirror to find, <quote>. It is at this point that instead of being mocked by <quote> he'll undergo conscious duplicity so that people won't be able to mock him.




He becomes a 'juge-pénitent'. We think he's confessing whereas he's just going through a well-rehearsed act. In confessing to a guilty moment in his life he's just encouraging the listener to admit to something worse. La Chute is really <quote> as Clarence is using the example of his guilt as a mirror to show the listener his. Being a 'juge-pénitent' he's superior to the listener because he's already admitted his guilt. At the outset Clarence uses 'je' to confess, then moves to 'nous' which brings the listener, and therefore mankind into complicity with guilt and then it turns into an accusation with 'vous' as he judges the listener. Others who are guilty of being duplicitous are man as, <quote>, Paris as, <quote> and Amsterdam because <quote>.

Finally Oreste feels remorse that he had spent so much time away from Argos. Argos was where he had been born and he looks longingly at the castle of Egiste thinking how many times he should have gone in and out of the gates. He meets his mother Clytemnestra when comes out to collect Electre who has been talking to Oreste whilst she did her dirty household chores. Oreste feels sadness for the upbringing he has missed out on. He feels Argos is rightfully his. However, by dwelling on the past, Oreste is showing bad faith and his decision to leave the city once he has called Egiste and Clytemnestra and defied the Gods is a sign that Oreste has matured and recognised his freedom and that the people of Argos finally have the choice over given own destinies. They will have to decide what to do with the power vacuum left behind by Oreste.


Oreste is pursuing a quest for truth, in search of the meaning of freedom, in order to discover himself. Initially in the play he has a very misguided sense of freedom, which in Sartre's views is the inherent characteristic of man - he is free to choose everything about his life because his consciousness (l'être-en-soi) is constantly looking forwards, separated from the past by nothingness. Oreste still believes in the existence and omnipotence of the gods. <quote> he says when told the history of Argos. In fact, as he comes to realize the play, it is only the meaning attributed to God or gods by man, which engenders this state of subservience to them. In refusing to accept total responsibility for themselves and to accept the nature of their freedom, many people resort to belief in determinism, to enable them to blame an external force for their mistakes at (???) behaviour. This is the essence of mauvaise-foi (bad faith) which is the concomitant of freedom, and the antithetical consequence of freedom, but which should be avoided in the search for the real truth. Oreste is therefore initially 'innocently' guilty of mauvaise-foi because of his subservience to the gods and also because he believes that <quote> ie whose life is predetermined by external force. Although he himself does not believe he falls into this category, his belief that some others do, is an indication of his imperfect conceptions regarding human freedom. He does however still believe that he needs guidance from some determining force outside his life, in order to find his way. <quote>, he says, <quote> He begins to see therefore that we each have a path to follow in life, a 'project' in Sartre's terms, but doesn't see that this is the result of a fundamental choice made by the individual rather than aided by someone else.
It isn't until Chapter 6 that Clarence actually reveals to the listener that he is judging him. Whereas used to like high places he has now found his 'sommet' in Amsterdam below sea level where he sits in judgement on those who are no longer thing to judge him as he has confessed his guilt.

This means that man always ultimately has a choice in reacting in , a particular set of circumstances. This aspect of choice is fundamental in 'Les Mouches' because the people of Argos have chosen to conduct their lives in an atmosphere it guilt and remorse. As the semiotic square shows, because the people have choice they could equally cross the diagram and live life of authenticity and freedom.




Before the laugh when he was a lawyer in Paris, Clarence thought that he past at one with himself: <quote>. But he realises later that he is guilty judging the people he deals with and people in general as he feels he dominates them.

A further sign of Oreste's initial mauvaise-foi is the fact that he desperately wants to unify himself with the city about Argos, and integrate himself into the place in order to find himself, to give himself an identity which he feels he lacks. This, in existentialist terms, is impossible because of the fundamental difference between the 'être pour-soi' and the 'être en-soi'. Objects, including towns only have existence, they only exist 'en-soi' and have no meaning until man attributes a meaning to them by means of the consciousness, l'être-pour-soi. Consciousness primarily defines itself by the presence of other consciousnesses (l'être-pour-autrui) because it is only in the look of another person that we realize we ourselves are objects of their consciousnesses and by their looked we recognize the values and merits they attribute to us. a city is incapable of fulfilling this reciprocal duty, so it is impossible for Oreste to define himself, obtain an identity or give meaning to his life simply by integrating into Argos.


As Albert Camus little rightly explains in the opening lines of Le Mythe de Sisyphe, there is only one real philosophical question. Is life worth living. Everyone at some stage in their life has asked this question to themselves. What am I doing here? Why am I writing this exam? What good will it do me? It is all too easy to get very depressed and yet such question enter the mind of the most stablest of persons.

Instead they turn to what Sartre terms bad them faith. This essentially means that one denies the truth of one's existence as the existentialists see it ie, there is no predetermining force in the world. In effect, one are in bad faith if one shelters from the responsibility and anguish that 'free' entails. A person is not only responsible for one's own conduct in life, but also to his fellow men.
Guilt is an important theme for Camus. By analogy to Mythe de Sisyphe, once you become aware of the absurd, the much reaction to it is true revolt which means a rejection of guilt. However, despite all the comparisons you can draw from Clarence to be absurd now, he parodies true revolt as he preaches a policy of universal guilt and commits his whole life to unveiling other people's guilt. He can't have absolute innocence so he wants absolute gult which, in analogy to the Mythe de Sisyphe is a perversion of guilt, revolution.
In the course of the play, Oreste comes to recognise the true meaning of individual freedom. He rejects the omnipotence of the gods (Jupiter in Les Mouches, but representing religion including Christianity as a whole) when he seeks a sign form Zeus (ie Jupiter) and is rewarded with a miracle, which he rejects. He describes the morals of religion as 'leur Bien', not his own. Similarly, he overhears Jupiter revealing to Egisthe the painful secret belonging to gods and kings: <quote>. the Oreste realizes that if he accepts his own freedom and completed responsibility for himself and his actions, then God (Jupiter) becomes meaningless; if he is no longer attributed a value or meaning by man, then he cannot control man. This argument represents Sartre's atheistic conception of the world - God is impossible, because he is a contradiction in terms. It is not possible to have a conscious omnipotent being which is also 'en-soi' ie with an object-like status, stable and eternal. Although man would like to be like this, he recognizes the transitory nature of his condition and, guilty of mauvaise-foi, attributes the desired qualities to a determining force. Oreste finally realizes no such determinism is possible in the search for truth and freedom.


The futility of life is that it could end tomorrow, next year or in eighty years. By your actions you can help preserve your life but Camus himself died in a carcrash in 1960. There is a thirst for God, for the knowledge of why we are here and hows the world was created. In 'Le Mythe de Sisyphe' Camus explains at length 2 the options man has when he discovers that the relationship between mans and the world is incomprehendable. One either commits suicide or one takes the leap of faith by believing in God.

Triadic structured run throughout the whole of La Chute.


The murders of Clytemnestra and . Egisthe by Oreste prove to be cathartic in that they enable him to accept responsibility his own crime without remorse. The people of Argos had deceived themselves by accepting remorse for crimes they wo not commit, brought on by the "look" of the monarchs who needed the comfort of communal remorse to evade responsibility for their own choices and crimes.
Guilt and remorse are the shelter from this responsibility. The murder Aggamemnon by Clytemnestra and Egisthe and their own spiritual parttaking in the crime the objects of this town's remorse. This collective absorption into guilt and remorse shelters them from the need to accept responsibility for their own conduct. In effect, they are deluding themselves and irresponsible.

had Eden


Man desperately wants a clarity of knowledge a unity with the world and yet he cannot achieve it. Scientific discovery is always relative never absolute and there is always someone else who comes along so further the cause of science and disprove or displace the previous truth. The means of communication men by which man understands his fellow man are too limited to be able to explain the absurd nature of the world. Camus himself recognises this and does not claim to have all the answers. We could say that everything is false but that would be a truth so how could everything be false? Everything in the world appears to be _ and yet nothing can explain it.

Progression along the road towards a fuller self-understanding and awareness of human freedom entails abandonment and resulting anguish. Oreste feels abandoned by Jupiter though in fact it is he who has rejected Jupiter's authority and movies by Electre, who, unable to accept the responsibility of her role of accomplice in the murder of her mother, falls victim to mauvaise-foi and rejects what had for been her increasing awareness of mankind's authenticity. Oreste feels anguish as a result of his solitude, but this anguish which leads to despair is a necessary part of his quest. Indeed, Jupiter said that, <quote> so it is clear that Oreste benefit in long run from his acceptance of the futile and restrictive nature of man's existence and the solitude of his freedom.
Religion and autocracy is other means by which they are able for do this. Jupiter is a parody of religion, reflecting Sartre's dismissal for predeterminism. The people are therefore enslaved by their attitude.
If the one truth you have though is that the relationship between man and the world is absurd then to commit suicide and take your life would be stupid for you would be denying the one truth that you had. Even if you decided to live, the leap of faith and belief in religion is not the option you should take either. Religion impedes on man's freedom, he will many have to enter a relationship of servitude with a God which will inhibit his ability to live life as fully as possible. It is a matter of despair to Camus that a philosopher such as Chekov should research deeply into the absurd and faced with the choice of saying the world is absurd or believing in God, he chooses God which to Camus is the ultimate sin because it offers comforts to people which are not based on truth. The existence of God cannot be proved, all that be proved is the absurd.



Orestes symbolise what is needed for them to break from their guilt and remorse, cross the diagram and live life to the full, facing up to one's responsibility a and accepting the difficulties that come with it. He, in contrast with Electra, is therefore a positive exemplary apprentice. He succeeds in accepting the responsibility of murdering the King and Queen and thus escapes remorse and responsibility. In this way, he is an example to the people of Argos which equates with Sartre's concept that 'freedom' involves responsibility to others. It follows, therefore, that atheism and democracy are requirements encouraged in this didactic work.
from Fall to Judgement



It would appear so far that Camus has argued well for the futility of life. he goes on in 'Le Mythe de Sisyphe' to try and proove life is worth living. He feels despair in a way about man's situation. He believes the absurd to be cruel but yet by contemplating the absurd and pardoxically by lucidity giving life meaning while knowing it has not got any, man can revolt against the absurd. The actual myth of Sisyphys typifies this reaction and is designed to give the reader hope and an example to follow. Sisyphus is a demigod who dies and on whose orders his wife throws his body into the street without burial. Sisyphus is given special dispensation by the Gods to come back to earth to sort his wife out. Sisyphus though misuses his time on earth and is hastily returned to the Gods who punish him. His task is to push a big boulder up a hill which continually falls down again just as he is to reach the top. By this act though Sisyphus actually relishes the challenge. He knows he will never succeed, he does not project himself into a future where he will succeed and by his struggle he has a dignity of action which no a can take away. He takes heart out of his for punishment and honour from it too so as to directly "attack" or revolt against the absurdity of the task which will never be accomplished. In this way Sisyphus gives his life a meaning and Camus wishes to encourage people in their moments of anguish and despair or bereavement that a happiness out of the world can be achieved. Sisyphus would appear to the reader to be happy in his task which would seem a terrible punishment.

Eden was where he felt in control of himself in his early life but then came the revelations and the trying to come to terms with them which is the Fall and then there is the final stage of judgement which could also be compared to Hell. There are many allusions to Satanic actions by Clarence throughout the novel. When they go to Marken and Zuyderzee there is the contrast between the clover and the island itself. In his room, the heats is stifling and his name Jean-Baptiste is a parody of Satan. And again he lives below the sea level into Amsterdam as opposed to as on high in the mountains or up in Paris. You also need three knocks to enter his room. Basically Clarence is a Satanic figure who realises and confesses his own guilt in order to make mankind realise their own guilt, and in so doing he judges others before they can judge him.

By the end of this play, we think Oreste has achieved his aim, that of finding his identity and freedom, , and therefore no longer needs the city of Argos in order to recognise the values choice, responsibility and freedom. His acceptance of the throne of can Argos would merely have been to perpetuate the crimes of Egisthe and would have been a relapse into self-denial and bad-faith. However, Oreste, whilst seeming to be the Existentialist Hero, claims, at the end, to take away the remorse and repentance of the citizens of Argos onto himself. It is unclear whether his initial project was to find his own identity or to free the Argonites, but if he is claiming to take away their remorse, he is not fulfilling the existentialist hero's role, because each person is ultimately responsible for himself and although Oreste can clear the way for the Argonites to free themselves from their remorse, he cannot do it for them. His conduct acts as an example, for the Argonites to follow, but if he professes to take their remorse away from them, he is slipping back into the claws of mauvaise-foi once again.




The Chapter on "lhomme absurde" in "Le Mythe de Sisyphe" reveals also the character of Don Juan. Recognising in his lucidity the absurd nature of the world, Don Juan lives his life quantatively instead of qualitatively. It is his object to cram in as many experiences as he can into the life for man has no idea of when he die. Don Juan's experiences are of the sexual kind. He dismisses love as emotional suicide for it is an emotion which will pass. Desire does not last for ever, typified the climatic experience of sexual intercourse. By living quantatively therefore life appears to have a purpose.









Les Mains sales presents aspects of the political world and moral values which may be considered into various ways, depending on the political and ethical morals of the audience. When it was first produced, as a play in 1948 and later as a film, it provoked great indignation of Marxist intellectuals, who felt that their position had been severely attacked by Sartre. Indeed Sartre's refusal to give permission for the play to be performed in the West after 1952 seems to indicate that it did objectively portray criticisms of the communist part which were not initially intended Sartre, as he did after all belong to the political far left although he was non-aligned.



to In the earlier work of Caligula, Caligula's quantative experience is murder. Camus recognises that such logic and reaction not possible outcomes of this line of thinking. Camus himself must have contemplated suicide on a number of occasions as he had a horrid time with TB throughout his life. At first glance 'Le Mythe it de Sisyphe' could be interpreted as being very negative in approach and indeed quite pessimistic. However man's desire for truth keeps him on the path of life and Camus is convinced that know the contemplation of the absurd and struggle against it can actually be a rewarding experience.


In order to see how Camus seeks to evoke a degree of sympathy or admiration for Caligula, it's necessary to draw analogies to the Mythe de Sisyphe and to Camus' absurdist theory. Before awareness of the absurd people they're happy even immortal just Caligula was a young, innocent idealist with relative values of good. This existence is then shattered by an event which makes you aware that life is futile. For Caligula this event was Druscilla's death. Camus does no try to evoke any sympathy for Caligula over her death as Caligula says There was once a lady she loved but now she's gone. The importance of her death is that it has sprung Caligula into awareness and lucidity of the fact that, <quote>. We will see later that you can sympathize with someone who suddenly realises the futility of life.




He has learnt that <quote>. This isn't an ease load for a young man to carry on his shoulders: <quote>. Once you discover the absurd you search for full understanding and knowledge but eventually you realise this is impossible, that you've separated from nature and this leads to an increasing feeling of exile. Caligula's search for unity with nature is symbolised by the moon. We can understand that his task is a difficult one but he sets to it tirelessly.  <quote>. His logic is that if he can do the impossible, have the moon in his hands, he can change the order of the cosmos and people really will be happy and immortal. This is admirable as he is trying to change the lives of people who think they're happy and immortal but are really unhappy and mortal. His second leg of this logic is less admirable as he decides to force people into the awareness by becoming the agent of death. Death is arbitrary and we have no control over it so Caligula, as E. Freeman ("The theatre of Abert Camus") points out, allies with the absurd and actually propagates it. <quote>. Despite his methods we can admire him for his logic in what he's doing and for his lucidity. He's not quite as mad as he seems: <quote>. Furthermore we can sympathize with his feeling of exile: <quote>.
The play does seem to be profoundly ambiguous in the political sense because whereas, on the one hand, it seems to portray a condemnation of the dependence of touch Communist Party on Moscow's orders (demonstrated in the play by the waste of Hoederer's life in vain followed by a switching of political tactics to his methods according higher orders) it does not, objectively viewed, condemn their means in achieving ends they pursue, although viewed by a non-marxist such means would be considered unethical.









In the Mythe de Sisyphe Camus shows that the besting reaction to the absurd is true revolt which is a denial of guilt and a refusal to submit yourself to a feeling from despair. Initially Caligula feels this despair as he says, <quote>. Instead of being to in suppress this feeling it stays with him but this is largely due to the fact that he chooses the wrong method. As for guilt he believes everyone has it and again due to choosing the wrong method of revolt he still has it after killing Caesaria as he turns to the mirror and says, <quote>.

The socialist/communist party the 'parti prolétarien' as a whole in the play is positively the viewed. Apart from the firsts scene, all the action is internal to the party and characters which are positively viewed such as Hoederer, and, to a lesser extent Hugo, both endorse the ultimate aims of the party; The two characters in the play who are not members of the PP, Karsky and the Regent, are both portrayed in negative light, which reflects, therefore, a positive way on the PP.







Similarly, although the communist means to achieve ends (ie assassination) would be abhorred for by an external viewer, every member of the party endorses methods, and would be prepared to die or kill for the party. Hoederer, Olga and Hugo all explicitly accept this, although Hugo evidently has problems fulfilling his aims.

With revolt you need to recognise the limits on your freedom and live life to the full. Again we have on to sympathise with Caligula he tries to find the solution to the absurd and chooses the wrong freedom. His freedom is at a the expense of others. He uses absolute power: <quote>. He also realises that philosophical suicide isn't the answer and he rejects the search for the moon.









However, he is iPOD with the despair and anguish of trying to help people but unfortunately choosing the wrong method of doing so. As he turns to the mirror he realises he was wrong, <quote>. He then chooses suicide which is again the wrong reaction to the absurd and his position is such that the are not many other choices.

The change of course of the Communist party, whilst Hugo is in prison, follows the historical precedent go of the PCF's involvement in the Popular Front and therefore represents a political reality, which although seemingly ambiguous, is a reflection of politics today; Similarly, the open admittance of Hoederer of being prepared to lie to the proletariat in order to fulfill the party's ultimate objectives, if 's is not so uncommon in the present political world.





The other characters help us to see that Caligula's actions can be admirable. Scipion has his father killed by Caligula but this has made him realise the absurd so at least Caligula's policy has had one success. Thrugh discussions with Scipio see how Caligula really does respect life and enjoys pleasures of nature. As Scipion says, <quote> and <quote>.



The treatment of Hugo, as a potentially anarchic intellectual in the play, and the party's lack of to concern over his personal ideals are also politically accurate, because, certainly in France, the PCF carried out a policy of encouragement towards intellectuals into times of popularity in order to bathe in their reflective glory, and of expulsion or 'non-recruitment' in times of difficulty.


Caligula has Hélicon, a slave he freed by side. This alone shows admirable aspects and in a powerful speech Hélicon evokes sympathy for Caligula through a comparison with the Patricians. When thinking the Patricians, himself, Caligula says, <quote>.






These aspects are therefore fairly accurate but their interpretation is ambiguous. It is not clear whether Sartre intended to criticize the Communists or not. On the one hand he seems to be praising their sense of duty to the party but on the other hand he raises the arguments for and against the 'volte-face' the Party carried out after Hoederer's death. Hugo represents one ethical stand-point at the end of the play. In his eyes, Hoederer's death will prove meaningless if he agrees not to claim it as a political killing but rather as a crime of passion. His act will also be meaningless. He has enormous respect for Hoederer, and had in fact gone to accept help in becoming an adult, an authentic responsible person, when he discovered Jessica with him. Therefore, he wants to see Hoederer's death respected in the way it should be - of a man who died for his ideals. Hugo sees no other way of doing this than to allow himself to be killed, presuming that his death will give meaning to Hoederer's. What he does not realize is that his death in fact renders both his and Hoederer's lives meaningless and is a futile act, because it is most likely the party will cover up his death and attribute Hoederer's death to a crime of passion, anyway, as yet another means to an end. Though his values are therefore well-placed, as portrayed to the non-marxist reader (a marxist one might consider his independence attributable to a lack of discipline resulting from his bourgeois background), his action is futile and we are therefore left wondering whether it was worth it for Hugo to stand up for his views. This is especially questionable in view of the fact that Hugo seems to have 'foiled' in his quest for truth and an identity by means of the Communist regime and is constantly doubting himself throughout the play. He is plagued by memories of his bourgeois childhood and the fear that he might betray the party to his background, in a similar way to his father, thus epitomizing the ambiguous nature of the play. Hugo seems to be aiming for one thing, but is plagued by worry and doubt - politically and ethically speaking, the play aims not to attack the Communists and their methods, but gives rise to doubtful opinions as it progresses, due to its ambiguity.





<ICLE-BR-SUR-0005.1>
Cherea too understands Caligula's logic: <quote>. He understands Caligula and what he's trying must do but again illustrates where Caligula has gone wrong. He believes although the world is futile, there are still good values and it can still be lived in a reasonable their way: <quote>. can now sympathise with Caligula for having gone so wrong, as we see Cherea's theory: <quote>.







Caesaria too understands and sympathises with Caligula. It is here that we discover that Caligula knows there is a happiness once you have become aware. <quote>. Unfortunately he's chosen the wrong method and will not experience this for long.
In his play "Caligula", Camus brings up the questions he had earlier raised in "Le mythe is de Sisyphe" concerning the absurdity of life and our acceptance of this. The way in which he portrays Caligula shows the perversion of the attributes expressed in "Le mythe de Sisyphe" as desirable. although he in many ways epitomises the Absurd man, as Camus describes him, Caligula's way of dealing with the discovery of the futility of life is a warning of acting in an absolute way. Cherea is used by Camus as a counter-balance to Caligula's absolute nature, and although he is not illogical, he realises the value of life and is therefore suggested to be right.







Camus takes actual reported events that the historical Caligula did. The arbitrary killing, the national <?>,the famine etc. are all unacceptable actions by Caligula. However we can sympathise with these because of his aims and because in a world where man is mortal, Caligula believes <quote> and it doesn't matter when you kill somebody because they're going to die anyway. <?> show that Caligula Especially is the only absurd character with the actual power necessary to carry through his logic so we can sympathise that he turns to this ways rather than some less heavy measures. Apart from this, though, Camus evokes more sympathy from things such as the fact that he feels he's killed less people because he's refused to enter three wars. Who can't have sympathy for a man who only sleeps 2 hours each night and spends the rested of his time roaming the corridors of his palace?
Following the death of Drusilla, Caligula has learnt the true nature of man's existence: <quote>. Man's mortality is now painfully clear for him, as is the futility of his life. And so Caligula has understood the absurdity of our condition; the fact that we can never possess the world and never have full clarity leaves him with a sense of anguish. However, unlike Sisyphe, in "Le mythe de Sisyphe", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it. Throughout the play, Caligula's reaction to the discoveries of the Absurd is to try and carry out the impossible, thereby changing the nature of the universe, and making man mortal and therefore happy. This is symbolised by his quest for the moon, and he tells Helicon right at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory is quite logical, the impossible possession of the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and could therefore change man's condition. However, the reality is that Caligula can never make man mortal, and so unable to avoid death, he becomes death. This is a more concrete aspect of Caligula's logic; he cannot change his situation, and so instead resolves to inflict his anguish on everyone else. He does this by revealing death to them, by showing them the futility of life and their mortality.







Part of Caligula's logic is his rejection of the Gods as a means of comfort. Just like Camus advocates athesism as a means of being true to oneself, that is to say his refers to religion as <quote>, a denial of ones freedom and dignity, so Caligula rejects the Gods and instead aims to be cruel and powerful as them. His rejection of fate and destiny, too, show logic, and Caligula makes himself destiny, <quote>. It is he who holds the power of life and death, not God nor fate.










one have <ICLE-BR-SUR-0008.1>

a Similarly Caligula is logical in his determination to live his own life to the full, although this is at the expense of others. He epitomises the quantitive ethic, be expressed earlier by Camus as another attribute of lucidity and awareness of the Absurd.








Guilt and judgement is a recurring theme in several of Camus' works. The account of Clamence's fall is not the retelling of an "évenement" but can be more accurately be described as "un état de l'âme", in which Clamance is embued with guilt and the desire to judge other people. Guilt wo implicit in the account, due to the fact that it focalized through the form of a confension, by Jean-Baptiste Clamance, an ex-parisienne lawyer, however it is also implicit in various subtilties throught the play, and alludes to the universal guilt of mankind. Clamance introduces himself as a "juge-pénitent", these term is not clarfied until the end of the novel, and it demonstrates Clamance's tendency to judge people, his desire to feel superior to other people and to apportion guilt to those he encounters.



However although Camus portrays Caligula's actions as logical, the absolute terms in which is sees life are wrong. His decision to become death, for example, is an expression of his own freedom, but a denial of with of others. He himself admits that, <quote>. It is for this reason that he orders arbitrary executions, a famine and has people put to death for minor offences. By portraying Caligula as such a horrific character, Camus was obviously showing he thinks Caligula's assumptions from his discovery of his freedom are the wrong ones.





Clamence's but former profession as a lawyer seems to back up this theme. It meant that he was in a milieu of guilt, since he was defending people guilty of crimes, or trying to prove peopling guilty of crimes. His profession gave him a feeling of superiority. In the court he felt superior to the judge and makes enjoyed the satisfaction he got from looking down on people and judging theme. Guilt and judgement are inherent in the legal system.





It becomes evident that Caligula has been wrong towards the end of the play. After strangling today Caesonia, Caligula accepts that he, too, is guilty, <quote>. do He even admits that he has taken the wrong and has made a mistake <quote>. He says that even if he could possess the moon and make the impossible possible, he could not undo the death and destruction his has caused. This admission that he drew the wrong conclusions from the realisation of the Absurd is Camus' way of saying Caligula was logical wrong.



In Paris, Clamence led what he thought was a happy and satisfying lilfe. He enjoyed helping people because of the satisfaction it gave him. He continued this existance until was shaken into acknowledging what he felt was the true state of the world, by laugh Since on a bridge. This occurrence made him aware of what he believed what the true state of the world. It broke his current existance and made him aware of his guilt.


<ICLE-BR-SUR-0013.1>

Finally, the fact that Caligula in the end allows himself to be killed so easily, after ritually committing suicide by smashing his reflection at the mirror, also is suggested by Camus to be wrong. In "Le mythe de Sisyphe" Camus condemns suicide as an escape from man's condition denies the Absurd and loses your dignity. Man should, he says, live his life in constant awareness of the Absurd but with the acceptance of this concept. Caligula was unable to accept his situation and his life can therefore be seen as one long suicide.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0011.1>

Clamence is guilty of several crimes, for example, he had witnessed the suicide of a woman and had done nothing to stop it. Also, whilst a prisoner of war he had drunk the water-ration of a die man because he (Clamence) was the camp "pope" and therefore judged his life to be more important than that of the dying man. Clamence by the means of a dialogue appears to be confessing his guilt to the enigmatic listener, however, what he is really doing is creating a situation in which having confessessed his own guilt, he exposes universal guilt and accusses the listener of being guilty. Because Clamence has declared his own guilt and shows himself to be aware of it, he exposes the listener to his own guilt, leaving him vunerable. This places the listener in a weak position over whom Clamence feels he has control. Clamence enjoys the feeling of power he gets from judging other people in this way. At face value, he appears to be revealing himself to his audience, however, he is really manipulating his audience so that he can lay there open his judgement. He seems to have an inherent need to judge other people. He likes high places from which he can look down and judge people, his favorite place, he says is at the top of a high mountain; in Amsterdem, a town which embodies vice and guilt, he sets on high in this symbolically (and physically because it is situated below sea leval) low place, and practises his art as a 'juge-pénitant', a process through which he both reveals his own weaknesses and guilt and then reverses the situation, appartioning the guilt to his listener, because in his view, everyone participates in universal guilt.
In "le Mythe de Sisyphe" Camus tries to explain from what meant by the absurd but in discussing suicide he advocates that lives is still worth living despite the futility of it.

Camus also suggests Caligula is wrong his interaction with other characters in the play. These characters . show sympathy and understanding for Caligula's position, and some even agree with him (for example Scipion), but they see life and our situation in relative rather than absolute terms, and are therefore more attractive to us. Caesonia, for example advocates rationality but also acceptance, love and values. She admits life can be bad, but does not see why Caligula wants to make it any worse! She tells him <quote>.

In the play 'Caligula' Camus is dealing with the themes of death and the absurd, and throughout the play we can see different characters reacting in different ways. they for however interact with each other, making the arguments of the other more credible or maybe discounting other's arguments English and thus swaying the audience for one side. It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.


The absurd is the realisation the men are mortal and that hence, whatever they are doing been futile because death is always inevitable in the end. If this is the case then all actions are equal, as nothing really matters. <quote>.
Clamence accuses the listener of universal guilt because no one can be completely innocent. Camus raises the idea that even Jesus Christ was guilty, because as as a baby, he escaped death while Herod massacred thousands of baby boys to ensure the destruction of the Messiah. He raised he question of whether people are guilty through non-action as much as through action. For example, during the war, those not participating in the Résistance might accused of collaboration, or those living next So to prison camps might be guilty through their inadvertance.
At the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later the 'death' only revealed a 'verité' to him - <quote>. Shocked it is not for his sister that he mourns the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.
Cherea, in particular, is used as a counter-balance to Caligula. His is illogical, in the which that he will not accept the anxiety and despair which are a natural consequence of man's freedom, and disagrees with many of the logical facts Caligula has established. For example, Cherea does not believe that all actions are equal. Caligula logically asserts that: <quote>, but Cherea denies this, prefering to believe in a hierarchical value system. However such a system is illogical as there is no God to imposes ethical values upon us and no-one to judge us. Cherea also says that men cannot live by pushing the Absurd to its final conclusion, and wants solidity and security in his existance. The uncertainty of the Absurd is too much him. Cherea wants people to live and be happy, to have purpose.




Man is born free, according to Camus and he having the choice to be however he chooses and can change this way of living whenever he wishes. Camus was an athiest he did not believe in any metaphysical power or fate which dictated how you should act.

He announces that he wants "la lune" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but for other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. Hélicon agrees to him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too. We see that he is searching for something out of reach, and we have sympathy knowing that the moon is impossible. Camus explores this theme in Le Mythe de Sisyphe where he says thant man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, onnes with nature, and innocence, but instead recieves lies, disorder, and separation of man and nature ending in death not immortality - and warns <quote>. The audience knows that the moon is not <quote> and takes pity.
The title is in itself a suggestion of Guilt and judgement. It applies not only to the suicide when the woman fell into the river, but also to the fall of Clamence, the fall of man, when he fell talk from his Eden due to the crimes he committed, and follows from this he is awaiting judgement. It also applies to the fall of Satan and the archangels from heaven because of their crimes. In these cases, Paris is portrayed as the Eden, while Amsterdam, <quote> is portrayed as its antithesis, being a den of vice and the scene of a historic crime, under Nazism, when involving the massacre seventy-five thousand Jews.

And so Cherea is portrayed as illogical because he refuses to accept the anxiety of the Absurd. However he sees life to relative terms and therefore is right. He has none of the despair which finally pushed Caligula to "suicide" and is therefore able to live life is a more enjoyable and fullfilling way. He is an attractive character with whom we sympathise, we therefore perceive him to be "right". Finally the fact the Cherea's life continues, while Caligula's ends must also suggest Camus believes he is right.


Man is always in search of knowledge & truth. He wants to be one with the world and understand it fully. This is not possible because, to understand something completely, you have to be fused with it, otherwise there will always have to be a leap of the mind. In scientific theory there is always a gap between experiments and their conclusion otherwise all theories would be the same. The only truth that we can be sure of is that we are mortal and will one day die. The awareness of the absurd may lead us to think that suicide would the be a natural consequence of seeing the futility of life, but Camus doesn't believe that at all. He believes that as man is constantly in search of truth and that death is the only truth we can be sure of, then we must continue bus live to persevere with this truth, <quote>.
And so, the courses of events in "Caligula" show Caligula to be logical, in that he lives out the life of the Absurd man as Camus had earlier described him in "Le mythe de Sisyphe". However, Caligula's failure accept the absurd, and his subsequent pervesion of his freedom suggests Caligula has been wrong. The character of Cherea emphasises these traits in Caligula, and although he are illogical, the final state from affairs in "Caligula" proves he has been right.

Scipion plays a great role in swaying the audience's opinion over to Caligula's side. We admire him - his father was killed by Caligula, but he has stood up to the fact and does not take such drastic action likes Caligula on discovering the human condition. Scipion is seen to be the mirror image of Caligula <quote>, and they discuss together just before the poet scene on their similar views - when Scipion reveals to him that he wites poems. They are both seen as taking pure, logical action which is admired by the audience, as they do not take part in hypocricy as the Patricians do. Each thinks that they are alone - Caligula says <quote>, but we admire him for taking a logical stance, as Scipion admires (and also fears) him for this. This idea is taken up in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, where the absurdist man lucidly goes in search of knowledge and unity. But we also find in Camu's earlier works the idea of the paradox between joy and despair - <quote>, and Caligula and Scipion together epitomise this paradox - Scipion says his poem <quote>. He understands Caligula, but at the same time is unable to reconcile the paradox - Scipion <quote> has to leave Caligula <quote> because he is afraid of the other side of the mirror and the side he would somehow compromise with. We have sympathy with Caligua despite his actions at this point because he first of all admires Scipion for his <quote> and he understands him. He also does not kill him, but quiety falls silent and merely says <quote>. At this point we agonize along with Caligula, and hope that he will give up his reign of terror - he however cannot look at his miror image - Scipion in the face, and turns back once more, a refusing to live somewhere inbetween 'le pur' and 'le mal'.

In the first chapter, Clamance points out the place where a painting stolen from the Cathedral at Gard used to and hang in the "Mexico-City" bar. In the final act this is revealed to be contained in his cupboard at the home. He is therefore guilty of possessing stolen goods. However, he does not regret this since he feels that the bar-owner knows he has it, so it is up to him to do something about it, and I also since there is now an exact copy in the cathedral it is irrelevant that he has it.




Scipion also seeks to justify Caligula when talking to others - he sad of him <quote>, and he obviously admired him greatly before the death of Drusilla. At the end the audience were informed that Scipion loves him, and cannot participate in his murder.

"La Chute" appears to be the confession of a guilty man, however it is more than this because Clamance playing the dual role of the confessor and the judge and after confessing his guilt, he is not necessarily repentent, but gains greater satisfaction from exploiting the situation to incriminate his partner.




Once man is aware of the absurd, he must live life to of full. It is a notion of hopelessness but not despair. As all actions are equal, this as they lead to the same end, then a on quantitive way of life seems logical as opposed to a qualititive way. Camus uses several examples to illustrate people pursuing this logic. He uses Don Joyein, a spanish lover who sleeps with as many women as possible, without paying any attention to how much he likes the individual women and whether he could be happy with one of them. He is not interested in the quality of the relationships, just in how much can be crammed into one life time, and is so seen to be living life to the full, whilst being aware of the absurd.

Guilt and remorse are apparent throughout the play "Les mouches", and are used by Sartre to express his opinions of Bad Faith, mainly by the acceptance to religion. Sartre wants people to realise that they alone determine their future, and they always have the freedom to choose which way to follow. He denies religion can help here, as it is merely an illusiory hope. By his portrayal of guilt and remorse, then, Sartre is condemning such manifestations of Bad Faith, and advocating individual freedom.


Caesonia and Cherea also portray Caligula in a positive light and evoke sympathy for the audience for him. Caesonia is devoted, bodily and spiritually despite her actions - she mekly says <quote> . We the audience can identify with her view - it is logical, but she is merely emotional and humanistic - simply giving herself to Caligula, and not lucidly pursuing to form her own life as Caligula does. Chérea in the same way, refuses to side completely with the Patricians, who are despised us for their hypocrisy, and therefore portray Caligula in a positive light. Chérea says he , I undestands Caligula, and says he is more similar to him than the Patricians. This also puts Caligula a step up in our estimation, as Cherea portrays a humanistic approach - probably very similar to the audience's.

In "Les Mains Sales", Louis accusses Hugo of being nothing more than an anarchist, and hence of no using to the party. It is true that Hugo had ideas and aspirations that did not fit into the framework of the Party because Hugo was obssessed with fulfilling his ideals with as much purity as possible, without dirtying come hands. In practical terms, this is much harder to achieve, but Hugo was young and inexperienced and had not yet discovered this. The play is a learning process for Hugo (although this does not necessarly lead to a positive conclusion), and therefore what Louis calls 'anarchy' is more likely to be a youthful enthusiasm. However, Hugo is not prepared to sacrifice the concept of purities for a more realistic approach and therefore he is unreceptive to the learning process.
The absurd, being the only truth, are man's link with the world and should be kept in view and should form the basis of decision as to how to live, <quote>.
We are repulse at the end of the play at Caligula's actions, but in the last scene he breaks down and admitted that his way was not the right way - <quote>.


The guilt of people of Argos is a collective guilt, and is a result of the murder of their king Agememnon by his wife Clytemnestre and her lover Egisthe. Instead of taking the responsibility for this crime themselve, Clytemnestre and Egisthe layed it on the whole town, who have been repenting for their "part" in the crime ever since. These people are wholely determined by this past act, and refuse to accept to the freedom and choice of the future. To them the murder of Agememnon cannot be separated from their consciousness and their lives and therefore affects their future and means they are without freedom. Their guilt is therefore a supreme act of Bad Faith in Sartre's eyes as it denies the existence of human freedom. An so the people of Argos not believe they have a choice in life, as everything is predetermined by this guilt, they deny the ability to control their own destiny and take solace in Jupiter, their God. Their remorse is constant, and is aimed at pacifying this God. Remorse, too, is a fundamental act of Bad Faith, as it denies responsibility of action, something which exists by virtue of our freedom. The citizens of The Argos, then, have taken refuge in collective guilt and use remorse as a means of denying their responsibilities. They thereby deny the fundamental concept of freedom and essence, which are both vital if one is to live one's life in the correct way.


In order to examine why Louis took such exception to Hugo it is necessary to reflect on the way in which the Party regarded intellectuals. Hugo came from a bourgeoisie background, consequently, having found a political cause, he was anxious to compensate for his background. He felt guilty of his bourgeoise upbringing and believed that he had to prove himself in some way to the party. Hugo wanted to impress Louis and Olga through some kind of test. However, the party was not interested in this kind of thing. Hugo wanted to prove that he was not some kind of spoilt intellectual and wanted a part in some real action. On the other hand, party had an already defined view of intellectuals and how they could best serve the party. Louis believed that Hugo short restrict himself to dealing with the jobs that matched his me qualities as an intellectual, such dealing with propaganda, and working on the party newspaper. The more active revolutionary activities, such as terroism, should be undertaken by the masses, who were more expendable then the intellectuals and could be more easily replaced then someone with a particular skill or talent. Hugo could have been of use to the party had he fulfilled the function which Louis wanted him to, and had left the more menial tasks to the masses.
Guilt and remorse are portrayed into many instances throughout the play, and those who accept these feelings are those who remain in servitude. The flies, after which the play is named, are continual reminders of the crime and plague the people, reminding them always to repent. The appearence of the flies towards the end of the story serves to turn Electre away from her freedom and back to repentence and servitude. Orèste, on the other hand refuses to let them affect him, he will not deny his true self.


He was trying desparatlely "for the good of Rome and by future to show the nature of the absurd, make man aware of life - but he was not able to carry his rock, or keep pushing it up the hill as Sisyphe - he was not <quote> because he refused to accept the paradox of joy and despair, and live in the "golden mean" - (Crinkshank)
Although life is futile, people are still free to a choose although its masses, as far as Camus is concerned, been unaware of this freedom. Even by not choosing something one is choosing not to do something which is still a choice.
Hugo sought some kind of glorifying test through which he could prove himself. However, the party was not interested in such glorifying tests, which came really a diversion from the fundamental concerns of the party, which were to ensure that the policies were carried out. Any such individual allusions for glory merely ego trips, and the party did not have time for these kind of frivallries. As Olga pointed out, the partys was not some kind of night school.

At the start of the play, when Orèste has just entered the town, we see a conversation between Jupiter (who is disguised as a man) and an old woman, which is clear evidence of the state of affairs in Argos. The woman tells Jupiter of the remorse of the town, but although she has accepted the burden of remorse, she denies having had any choice in helping Agememnon. Jupiter plays on her guilt, asking <quote>. The woman does not accept she alone was responsible can for her inaction, and says there was nothing she could do. This, then, is Bad Faith, as it denies both choice and responsibility. The woman tells how everyone in Argos repents for their crime, not just those who were present when it take place. Even children are brought up to feel remorse and guilt for something they had no influence over. This past act not affect their lives, though, as they have the freedom to define their own essence.


We saw at the end, anguish and tragedy - and admiration tuns to sorrow as Caligula emotionally and dramatically smashes his reflection in the glass declaring his willingness to die and give up.



The absurd can lead to anguish; anxiety nothing you do is necessary , the choice is yours whether to do it or not. Religion provides a sanctuary from this anxiety by making believe that they are not free because they are governed by a metaphysical force, God, and are therefore subservient and not free. According to Camus religion provides false hope. People are hoping a better life in next world rather than trying to live life to the full in this one.


Hugo should have stuck to doing what he best and contented himself with a party career in journalism. He was not suited to carrying out the basic revolutionary activities, such as political assasinations and other murders, because, being an intellectual, he was more likely to preponder on the significance of his acts and may have been unable to carry them through, whereas an ordinary party member may not have concerned himself with the same intellectual dilemas that Hugo harboured. This is, in fact, demonstrated by the fact that Hugo was unable in carry out his orders to kill Hoederer and was procrastinating in his moral dilema. He only killed Hoederer in a moments of jealousy and therefore Hoederer's murder can attributred only to a crime of passion and not to a political crime.


This does not mean that you can't have morals when you are aware of the absurd. You do not necessarily should to be a complete nihilist, but you must be aware that it is you that is making the choices of what action to take.
Throughout the play language is used which is reminiscent of the ritual confession of Catholics. Such repentence is especially apparent for "La Fête des morts". This "fête" involves the "ressurection" of the dead, in the eyes of the Argites, at least for a whole day, they believe their dead are with them, to punish them for being alive, and for past crimes. Again, the emphasis is on the past determining the future. The people even repent their guilt for living! Such remorse keeps a people subserviant and at the will of both the king and queen and Jupiter. Jupiter preys on the guilt and remorse of the people, as do their temporal leaders. By making the people live in the past they are denying them their right to life and denying their freedom define their essence. The people have no with essence, as they are unable to realise the truth about their existance and cannot therefore escape the servitude.


If you begin to see the futility of all the objects around you, like you snap out of consciousness, Camus believes you can have a feeling of nausea. If everything is stripped of its preconceived meaning that we have given it, it becomes meaningless and futile. If this line of thinking is continued then man will realise the superfluous nature of his own presence. All the objects him would still exist, just wouldnot have a meaning. It is human beings who insist on categorising everything into order to explain it.
Remorse is also shown in the mourning clothes the people wear and their complete lack of joy. There is no laughing, dancing, or joy in Argos, only remorse at their supposed crime, and a continual reminder of this.
Clamence cries out at the end to La Chute - <quote> - he realises that he is alone in the world, and concludes - <quote>. Clamence reaches a point of despair at the end <quote>, and we can see throughout the novel what has brought him to the sence of despair, and what and who has betrayed during his life.



Hugo was unlikely to be of much use to the party because he was to obsessed with a moral purity. He wanted to see certain changes brought about, but without sacrificing his ideals. Whereas Hoederer and the others believed that the means justified the end, and were prepared to negotiate with a other side and make compromises if they believed this would facilitate their victory, Hugo felt that this was hypocracy and bad faith. Hugo was unable to reconcile himself to the loss of purity and consequently could not fit in with party lines. Hence, he was not of much use to the party, since he was unable to adapt to party policies, to fit in with the rulings of others. He was too much of an individual to comply with party discipline. Being a member of the party implied conforming to party ruling, however Hugo was not prepared were to sacrifice his principles to do this and was therefore a danger to the party. He was an individual and done not fit in.

The actual "myth of Sisyphus" which is used in the writings to illustrate his point about the absurd, is quite simple but may help to explain further why Camus belieives that although life is futile, it is still worth living to the full. Sisyphe died and his wife through him by onto the street. The Gods decided that he could go back down to earth to punish his wife. Having doneso Sisyphe wanted to remain immortel. To punish him the Gods condemned him to roll a heavy rock up a hill only to find that when he reached the top the rock rolled back down. He was to do this eternally but he was still free to think and was happy in a way. He chose to treat the task as if it did matter and was important whilst still being aware of the absurd. So no matter how futile life is because of the truth being that we all die, life should be led to the full.
The themes of guilt and remorse can be seen to be parody of the guilt of the catheolic church. As I have said, the continual repentance ressemples the confessional of the church. Also the people are repenting for the "original sin", just as catheolics feel collective guilt over the fall of man, Adam's original sin. In a similar way to the situation a Argos, the guilt expressed by catheolics is a denial of their freedom and an act of Bad Faith. In this way, Sartre, an atheist, canned be seen to be attacking the Church, we he feels is an illusiory comfort depriving men of their true selves.

This individuality & refusal to conform, obviously implies some kind of anarchy was inherent within Hugo's relationship with the party. However, this can largely be attributed his youthfulness. 'Les Mains Sales' is learning process for Hugo in which he is unsuccessful does not learn to conform to the model favoured by the party. Unable to put aside his own principals, Hugo does not fit in to the party framework and cannot conform to its model. Therefore, he cannot be of much use to the party.


Through talking to the invisible 'interlocuteur' and revealing his past to us through monologue and heavy irony he tells us of certain areas of his life where he has had to change, and has been 'robbed'. 'Le rire' as he is crossing the bridge is the place in his life when his smile becomes "double". of The theme of duplicity in the novel highlights the two sides to his nature - and so reveals to him the side he has 'lost' has so has been betrayed by the 'laugh'. Clamence explains the throughout the book how he lost his innocence, silence, simplicity and truth because of this one laugh on the bridge. He lost his 'Eden', and began to fall until he reached his hell in Amsterdam.

The characters of Electre is particuliarly important in expressing guilt and remorse. Although she has the promise of authenticity at the start of the play, this is merely deludory, and is done to avoid being "part" of the town. However, through her refusal to accept freedom, choice and responsibility for her acts, Electre too becomes a part of the collective guilt and remorse of Argos. Despite learning the truth that <quote>, Electre runs away from the anguish of her freedom and takes solace in Jupiter. She shows guilt and remorse for her acts and thereby is reduced to servitude. Électre epitomises Sartre's idea of Bad Faith. Her brother, Orèste, on the other hand, learns of man's freedom during the play and his project crystalises, leading to the murder of Egisthe and Clytemnestre. Unlike Électre, he refuses to repent for his crime, and has no guilt or remorse. Certaintly, his new found freedom accompanied by anguish, abandonment and despair, indeed he describes his freedom as "un exil", but nevertheless, Orèste is free. By denying guilt and remorse, Orèste is able to find his true self, gain essence through his acts and become truely free. This is what Sartre wants us to do -to accept our freedom no matter how painful it is and not to take refuge in guilt and remorse. Orèste, then, epitomises authenticity and all its attributes.


The essence of a person is only the sum of his actions and just a person is free to change the way again he acts it has to be the sum she of his actions when he dies, as that is where the choices end.

He began to think that everyone was laughing at him <quote>, and <quote>, to revealing his as a guilty man, and no longer upright, honest and modest. This is explained in a very ironic tone, as Clamences uses false modesty throughout, showing yet another duplicitous side to his nature - truth - and falsehood.

So although life is futile we must live it to the full according to Camus because,

'Les Justes' describes events from the 1905 in Revolution, which , was a precurser to the events to 1917. However, with the exception of Stephan, the terrorists in 'Les Justes' are seeking a new world full of love and happiness, and practised a moderate form of political activity than those who overthrew the régime in 1917.

"The insurrection man 's a continuous revolt against death".
Guilt and remorse are, then, very powerful and important themes to "Les mouches" and are used to demonstrate the perils of denying one's freedom to define one's essence, and to choose which way to follow. Guilt and remorse involve placing events beyond one's owns control, but this is not the case, as we force have the ability to choose our own project and follow this through life.
Clamence also lost his sense of silence, that was so important to Camus in earlier writings especially l'Etranger. When he heard the laugh - <quote>. As he tries to escape the laugh through debauchery he still hears <quote>, and then he decides to stop the laugh complelety and take on the jobbing of judge, and penitent at the same time, so that noone can laugh at him, and he has time to confess before they speak. This is also reflected in the narration - which is a cacophony of sound, a <?> monologue where his 'interlocuteur' cannot speak, and his silence is forced by Clamence.



Camus was acutely aware of death because of having TB this must spurred him to explore life in this light, which at first glance is rather morbid but could be seen as very positive.


Clamence has also been betrayed by the laugh in losing his sense of truth and simplicity. He notices the barman and <quote> - probably envying him. Likewise, he indulges in lies - <quote> and <quote> Clamence finds, as does Camus in Le Myth de Sisyphe that after truth and understanding are unobtainable. Clamence also loses his sense about clarity <quote> he says - and we notice the presence of fog and mist in Amsterdam - "ce brouillard" of debauchery as he attempst escape his betrayl.


The characters in les Justes seek a modified form of revolt underwhich the oppressed can be freed of my chains of the oppressers. In "l'Homme Revolté", the forerunner to "Les Justes", Camus describes "les meutrieurs délicats", who seek the change in the system so that the oppressed become free, as opposed to a full-blown revolution, which is merely a rotation of role so that the oppressed become the oppressers and vice versa.





At the start of the play "Les Mains Salles", Louis and Olga are discussing whther Hugo be allowed back into the party. Louis refers to him as <quote> and argues that his background made him unreliable as a member of the Party. Throughout the play, "anarchist" is synonymous with "intéllectuel", which, of course, Hugo is because of his bourgeois background. It is not just Louis who doubts the utility of Hugo, Slick and Georges, and even Hoederer, all use Hugo's background as a weapon against him, assuming that being from the borgeois classes will make Hugo less trustworthy and less disciplined. Through his portrayal of Hugo, Sartre is in fact questing the relationship between intellectuals and the communist movement.
The themes of guilt and remorse in "Les Mouches" made stronger the the paradox with religion, particularly catholic.
The terrorists act with restraint into their activities, choosing their targets carefully. Stepan on the otherhand is an absolutist and rejects this saying that revolt has to be no or nothing, that if you are prepare to kill one person for a cause, then you have to be prepared to kill many more, since otherwise their deaths will be futile. When the hero, Kaliayev was engaged to throw the bomb at the Grand-Duke Serge, the culmination of many months of preparation, he backed out at the last minute because the Dukes neice and nephew were travelling with him and Kaliayev could not bring himself to kill innocent children. The other terrorists sympathised with him, with the exception of Stepan who believed that the children were an irrelevance, that it was wrong to be discriminate regarding one's victims and that because these two spoilt children had survived, thousands of Russian children would starve as a consequence.


His betrayl by the laugh has mean that he has fallen from the lights to or depths - where he has created his own circle of hell for himself. He used to love being "au dessus", but now he is in the cente of the circle of rings of hell in Amsterdam - (referring to Dante's Inferno). He blames this on man, and announces univesal guilt to the world, where there been no more innocence. His betrayl has led him to become 'un faux prophète' who announces univesal guilt, where there is also no saviour.


It is not only Clamence however who feels betrayl, Camus aswell comes through the satire and irony from time to time to reveal deep painful emotions and his sense of betrayl in the 1950s. His novel l'Homme Revolté caused Jeanson to react violently, and critise the book. He accused Camus of having 'l'esprit pur' and being a moralist, unconcerned with the plight people who join revolutionary organsations. The novel warned agaist revolution saying that "revolt as an expression of human consciousness is innocent, whereas revolution which takes its basis from violence is guilty" (Ginkshank)
The first theme of guilt is that of the whole population of Argos. Their former ruler was killed his wife, Clitamnestre, and her lover and the whole of Argos is forced to feel remorse because they did nothing to stop the murder and were actually quite keen on it because the king had stopped them from having public executions. This universal guilt does simmilar to the guilt of the people, in the catholic church particularly, because of the "original sin". Children are born into Argos and forced to feel remorse for something which happened before they were born. They must repent, as in the church. The population of Argos accept this and are unaware of their freedom in the "Satrian" sense. They have the freedom to make choices for example as to whether to repent or not. They does not saw this freedom.
In the second act, Louis has taken an instant dislike to Hugo because of his background. He calls him <quote>, and assumes this will make him undiscipline and hence of no use to the party. The arguments against Hugo centre on discipline - can an intellectual at odds with himself and his upbringing make a disciplined party member. Louis doubts this, and is reluctant advise give Hugo any jobbed that is important. Slick and Georges, too, distrust our "anarchist" because of his background, and refer to him as <quote>. They resent the fact that Hugo has entered the party out of principle when for them it has been a matter of necessity and attribute the problems between them to <quote>, or background. Even Hoederer, who obviously cares about Hugo thinks he is an anarchiste, and accuses him of wearing <quote>. This is because Hugo refuses to compromise his ideals, and holds to them regardless of the cost. As an intellectual, Hugo is probably less pragmatic than Hoederer, who is prepared to done whatever is necessary to gain power. He tells Hugo <quote>, and that the only end is power. Hugo disagrees and argues <quote>. Hugo is prepared to keep to his ideals whatever the cost, as Hoederer remarks: <quote>. An intellectual like Hugo, then, an anarchiste, is afraid of real action, although he is quite happy to dream of it. Hoederer believes anarchistes to make good murderers, but bad party members!
It is difficult to justify killing of any kind, but Dora and Kaliayev believe that it is possible to compensate for these murders through the giving of their own lives. This, they believe is payment for the deed and eradicates the original crime. This, of course, is an absurd concept, because the loss of two lives does not help those who have died, the death of the guilty murderer does not do the victim any good. Giving up one's life is a negative action, because an activist could help its organisation far more by remaining alive and continuing the cause, whereas a dead man can do nothing to further the cause. Dora and Kaliayev, reconcile each other that they will meet in the after life. In their physical forms, they chastize each other and put aside their love for each other, dedicating themselves to their cause which they believe to be the most important reason for their the existance. They make this chivallrous sacrifice to prove their dedication to the cause and seem to commit themselves to a 'monkish' earthly existance. The fact that they are prepared to do this, seems to add worth to the cause due to the fact that they are prepared to made such a sacrifice. They do not put their faith in God (although at his death, Kaliayev turns to God), yet the acknowledge the presence of some kind of metaphysical, where they will meet after their deaths. However, this for sacrifice does not do anyone any good, but it simply justifies the cause in their eyes, and reinforces their committment to it.




Electre becomes aware of her freedom a while, when she disrupts "fête des morts". Jupiter performs a small miracle, so the people of Argos do not take Electre's lead and refuse for repent.
During his emprisonment, Kaliayev is given three attempts to save his life. He receives three visitors, Foka, a prisonner and an example of the man Kaliayev is trying to free; secondly, he receives a visit from the chief of police, and thirdly, he is visited by the wife of the murdered Grand-Duke. Each time he is offered repentence and the chance of a repreive. However, he is unprepared to implicate his accomplices by revealing their names. It would also morally be an act of bad faith for Kaliayev to back out of his execution, because he believes that by facing death, he can take on the sins of the world and thus repreiving man-kind. Just as Jesus took on the sins of the world, Kaliayev believes that through death he will repent his crimes, with freeing mankind by taking on the burden of their sins. Through death, he hoped to relieve himself of his own sins and thus achieve a state of child-like innocence and purity, truly unburdened of his mis-doings.
In the course of events, we see whether this view of Hugo is well-founded. Is he prepared to work for the good of the party, or do his anarchistic desired make him of no use? There is much evidence to support the views offered by Louis, Slick and Georges and Hoederer. Hugo's idealistic view of party membership, for one thing, shows that his motives are perhaps selfish years he is more interested in what the party can do for him than what he can do for the party! He has joined the party to escape from his background, yet is obsessed with this background and his desire to act seems to be borne out of hate for his father, in particular. Hugo wants to be a hero, and fantasises that he can be like the anarchistes in Russia in the early 20th century. His obsession with assasination, shown by his desire to be "tested", is surely a bad motive for a revolutionary. It is this obsession which means Hugo is not content until he is given such an important task as Hoederer's assassination, as he has to prove he can be trusted. It can be seen that Hugo wants to find an identity in the party which he himself is lacking.



Camus felt complelety misundestood, and was at a time in his life when he felt deep on depression and felt alone in the world with no friends. He had lost his existentialist friends, after writing an aggressive letter star Sartre about Jeanson's reaction. He felt that man was too concerned with ideas, and not with the precious side of human not life, and the need to preserve it. The novel 'La Chute' is about <quote>, and what happens if extemes are taken too far.
After his death, Dora became aware of ther contradictions inherent within world and realized that she could not face up to such contradictions. She decided that she would rather meet up with Kaliayev in the metaphysical, than continue to live in a world of contradictions, where she could not reconcile her aims, motives, principals and morals with reality. Therefore, she demanded that she should throw the next bomb, knowing that she would die as a result, as a kind from political suicide. It was her reasoning that in this way, one dies twice. The first death occurs when the bomb is thrown, since this condemns one to death, and then the indivdual dice a second time, at the actual execution. Therefore, she believed that one paid for all one's sins twice, expurgigating them two times over.

Oreste comes back to Argos, having left as a baby, to discover that the place that should the have been his was ruined and covered with flies, which had been sent by Jupiter. Oreste felt no guilt or remorse as he had grown up elsewhere but he felt he had to are something. Electre had been waiting for to come and save her from servitude, as if waiting for the massiah to deliver her from evil. Oreste's first reaction was to save Electre but then he felt he needed to save the whole town from these awful dictators.

The anarchist Hugo is also wholely against compromise, even if this is against the party line. He firstly tells Louis that he will never compromise his ideals by favouring a coalition goverment with the borgeois parties, and this decision borne out . in his horror of Hoederer's politics. It can thus be shown that as an intellectual, , and anarchiste, holding to the purety of his ideas, Hugo is unreliable as a party member.

The terrorists in Les Justes, many justified their acts by making various moral and physical sacrificises. However, these sacrifices do little to help man themselves or the injured party.

There are many 'extremes' throughout La Chute. The dialogue which is authoritarian, and continuel prones narration to the exteme. Guilt is also seen as exteme. , is no innocence, and the whole universe is "objectively" guilty. Camus feels betrayed by the society he lives in - we see glimpses of this in Clamence's narration <quote>, and Clamence says very ironically <quote>. This is also a glimpse of Camus, who was accused of writing to 'nicely' in L'Homme Révolté, and of staying 'on top' of the ideas - superior to it.
Another fact which questions Hugo's party loyalty hence utility is his loyalty to Olga Louis, rather than the party itself. He wants to impress them, as he admires them. This, too, is hardly a good motive for a revolutionary.


Oreste decided to kill Clitamnestre and her lover and so remove to guilty party, with a view to ruling the country himself. Electre agreed with him to start with but Jupiter won her over and after the murders she felt guilt and remorse. This guilt turned her face old and haggard like Clitamnestre's before her. Her guilt might having been genuin but the people were repenting so much and being so weighed down with remorse so that they were seen to be repenting by other people. If it wasn't for 's the existence of others there be no guilt at all because there would be no-one to judge you. As Satre was athiest he would not believe in the final judgement.



Perhaps what demonstrates more than anything else Hugos inability to do as the party asks is his failure to kill Hoederer for the right reasons. He knows why he should kill Hoederer - because he is making bad policy, yet he is emotionally unstable and is persuaded by Hoederer's offer of political and personal guidance. Were he not an anarchiste Hugo would perhaps not have deliberated for so long over the assasination. In the end, Hugo kills Hoederer by chance, because he saw him kissing Jessica. He admits to Jessica <quote>. This does, I feel, prove that Hugo was really of no use to the party. Too involved with his own personal crisis, Hugo was unable to accept party discipline and unwilling to compromise any of his purity.
Jupiter tries to trap Oreste into his web of remorse, like the last temptation of Christ. Jupiter is the god of Argos but also the God of death. He does not though bring people out of their graves to haunt people on the "fête des morts". All that is in the minds of the people themselves.
Camus felt betrayed in the fact that he had lost his 'silence' - symbolised in the 'dialogue', he had lost his 'Eden' - (it was known that he loved Algeria, the sun, the country, his mother and peace), and had been betrayed by his own friends who did not understand him. This is symbolised in the structure of the novel where it is hard to find a single point of reference, though follow his monologues - (Clamence's).

go <ICLE-BR-SUR-0009.1>

After the murders Oreste faces the people and proclaims that he will leave and took with him the flies, were a symbol of their guilt brought by Jupiter.


Camus was known to feels very alone, and feels he must hold up the mirror of his face to others - a face which repents of his past acts and also judges others. Gaillard says of Camus <quote>.

Oreste left but he could not force the of Argos to feel no remorse or guilt. He could only give them the freedom for change the way they lived, but they had to recognise that freedom and make use of it. This is simmilar to Christ giving up his life so that man could be free but not telling them what to do with this freedom.
In Caligula the story is built up through interaction of the characters. All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means , eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula. Our own values and emotions play a large role in this right from the start when Caligula is thought to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla. This grief although incorrectly perceived by his courtiers, perhaps makes us feeling sympathy for Caligula. When his patriciens think that the young Emperor is ill or mentally disturbed we may feel sympathy for him if we areselves do not like being unwell.
It can be concluded then that not only Clamence, but also Camus feels a sense of betrayl. After holding ups a mirror to fellow existentialists - they may also feel betrayed as they begin to fall, but we also, the reader are involved in the novel. Clamence making no answer the questions - <quote>. We perhaps too will feel betrayed after reading La Chute.


Hugo's "suicide" at the end of the play is very much the act of an anarchist. By getting himself shot, Hugo hopes to attach some importance he Hoederers death, and to his owns act, he does not want the party to believe he killed such a man as Hoederer over a "mere" woman. Although he did not kill Hoeder over politics, he believes that by refusing to say his killing was a mistake, he will somehow attribute importance to the act. Hugo cannot accept that the party line But changed, and still will not compromise his ideals, preferring death to losing his purity. This final gesture is totally futile and emphasises the fact that Hugo was of no realistic use to the party.




Caligula is based on Camus' theme of the absurd, which is according to Adèle King "the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires". From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of humans existence. He murders indiscriminantly, causes famine and even kills his own lover. What man wants is to be immortal and happy, something which, with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula knows is impossible. However Caligula revolts against the absurd by trying to achieve the impossible so that <quote>. The symbol of this impossibility is the moon. Caligula thinks that if he can have the moon he will be above the gods and in charge of an empire where the impossible is king. Caligula therefore decides to be destiny - <quote>. He wants to show his people the one truth he has - that <quote>. He sets out to show them their immortality and their sadness by killing them. To a certain extent Camus manages to evoke sympathy admiration for Caligula in that the Emperor wants to share the truth he has found about the world with his people. He wants to help them understand for their own good. He wants to make them aware of the absurd, as he is, so that they can then go on to live quantatively and intensly.



Louis shows a mistrust in Hugo which is commons for a working class leader to feel a petit bourgeois intellectual. He sees men as too self-interested and egotistical. They are often anarchists and want to be integrated with the party and performe assassinations. This am a job that they are not trained for and they would be more useful doing other jobs for the cause.

Events in the play show, then, that Hugo does deserve to be called an anarchiste and hence demonstrate he is of no use to the play. His motives for joining the party are wrong and his actions misguided. But, of course, there some positive aspects to Hugo which might have been valuable to the patty that had he not been so determined to follow his conscience.


Caligula not only wants to show have people the one truth possible to man, the absurd, he wants to rebel against the absurd in order to make existence more tolerable and less futile for mankind. He wants to destroy the very contradiction of the absurd and make man immortal. He says: <quote>. The reader/audience may admire Caligula for trying to achieve this through aquiring the moon, despite the fact that this is a paradox of Camus' main theory of the absurd. Camus advocates that one should accept the absurd but revolt in the sense that one confronts the absurdities of living and lives as intensly as possible. Caligula has the lucidity to recognise the absurd and revolts. But he revolts without adhering to any limits and does not accept the basic contradiction of man's existence.

Hugo shows many of these attributes but as we shall see was not perhaps the anarchist Louis accused him of being. He was from a bourgeois backrounce and desperately wanted to was rid of it, apart from still having a wife whom he married whilst still in that class, and some photographs from his childhood. He wanted to be really integrated in the party, whereas at the he still felt cut off and classed as an intellectual bourgeois because he wrote the paper. If he had only got the party's interests at heart then he would have persevered with the job he was useful for. Instead of which he wanted to assassinate someone; a job which he was not trained in. His reasons for wanting s to do this at first appear political, but we then realise that he wanted to do it to earn the respect and love of Louis and Olga. In other words he had purely selfish reasons for insisting on having this particular job.

The play Les Mouches seems to I revolve around the themes of guilt, remorse and death - nearly everyone in I play at some time taking refuge in remorse (perhaps not Oreste) which is a sign of bad faith mauvaise foi according to Sartre.
Firstly the refusal to compromise can be seen in a good light, and reflects his devotion the cause. However it must be remembered that Hugo was more concerned with principals and the communist "cause" than with the party itself and reality. To working made the sacrifice Hugo made in joining the party, Hugo must truely believe in his principles. However, this too is negated if we take the view that Hugo joined the party to merely take on an identity. Intellectuals may be of use to the communist party, particularly as a form of propaganda last and because of their capacity to verbalize and theorize (producing a good argument). However when the intellectual has a personal crisis like Hugo the good points are generally negated by the bad.


Caligula is shown to be logical, an admirable quality to a certsin extent. All his actions are linked to his logic and his determination to persue logic <quote>. His conrtiers recognise that he is logical and that <quote>, even if they do not agree with his logic. Cherea, who admits that Caligula is logical has a positive valourisation for the Emperor. He supports Caligula to a certain degree in the way he 'admires' Caligula for trying to diminish the futility of human existence. Cherea is shown to be right but illogical. He is aware of the absurd and choses the live with it. He wants to . be both immortal and happy but knows that this cannot be achieved <quote>. Caesonia also gives a positive value to Caligula's argument. She stands buy him despite realising the he is not following the correct path to achieving his aims. Hélicon is another positive character for Caligula who will not help to kill him, despite knowing that Caligula himself is inviting his own death.
As time passes Louis proved right in that Hugo is no taking to the party liking he has not killed Hoederer. He had been putting it off because he actually liked Hoederer although did not agree with his political I means of starting a revolution.

And so, to conclude, I belive that Louis is correct when he accuses Hugo of being an anarchiste, the similar opinion of others only serve to make this more valid. Hugo's actions throughout the play clearly show his preoccupation with himself, and his death is in keep with the idea of him as an anarchist. Being so undisciplined, Hugo is not really much use to the communist party, which demands absolute subordination of the individual to the party.

La 'mauvaise-foi' - is when of person denies their liberty when it is placed before them and takes refuge in past values, religious creeds, or anything which prevents a man from making his own choices, and working outs his own liberty. Sartre will in L'Existentialisme est un Humanisme, <quote> and <quote>.

Scipion helps to evoke sympathy for Caligula in that he changes from being totally opposed to the Emperor at the beginning to trying himself to find out the truth that Caligula has hinted to him. What , Caligula kills Scipion's father, the younger man is full of hatred for Caligula and his actions. Scipion goes from the one extreme to the other, of absolute hatred to absolute admiration for Caligula. As Caligula also is a man of absolutes, Scipion reinforces his ideas and actions.


The Patriciens force the reader to see Caligula in a more positive light through their hatred for him, their plotting to kill him and their 'apathy' towards existence. They carry on with their lives without trying to find truth, understanding or unity. They accept existence as it is and live accordingly. This makes one admire the effort Caligula puts into being lucid, living quantatively and trying to confront live as much as possible.
Hugo seemed to be become idealistic comparing anarchistic. He was rather immature and desperate to belong. He , had a great feeling of loneliness as many intellectuals did. They only hated the working class they were fighting for slightly less the bourgeois people they came from.
the 's <ICLE-BR-SUR-0006.1>



The past in Les Mouches is seen to be important to the majority of the Argine population - in fact all of them. The people of Argine blame themselves for the death of Agamemnon and spend their livs in remorse for their 'act' (they in fact got 'looked on'). Even the children are taught how to repent <quote> a women says to Jupiter. La fête des Morts is a culmination of their repentence, when the dead are 'resurrected' and come to live amongst them for the day. They scream out repentence at the festival and is seen as being unable to shake off the feeling of guilt at the end of the play.

Hugo did eventually kill Hoederer proving his worth to the party by carrying out his orders but he was not sure why he did it. He walked in on Hoederer and Jessica (Hugo's wife) whilst they were in an embrase and this scene prompted him to shoot Hoederer. At the end of the play Olga is talking to Hugo trying to decide whether he is "recuperable" by dicifering Hugo killed Hoederer out of jealously or for political reasons. The problem was that the original reason for Hoederers assassination was because he wanted join up with the other parties in order to gain power and then work from there. This was not acceptable to Louis and the others at the time. However orders from Moscow changed and so Hoederer's policies were adopted after his assassination. The party needed Hugo to deny that it was a political assassination as this would embarass the party. If he died over a woman is would be a hero.
Le Mythe de Sisyphe is a novel that is to bound with duplicity. This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The mains themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdities of life and suicide.

Sartre in L'existentialisme est un Humanisme outlines the meaning of reverting back the past and falling into bad faith. Instead of being 'pour-soi' and free and disponible to act, and take responsibility for the future, the people fall back into the past and take on the value of an object - 'être en soi'. These values are seen as viscous and opaque, not clear, as they try to mould their consciousness into that of an object which cannot be aware of surroundings - it is simply there. If man were free, then he would not look to the past. He would recount past values, and make new one for the good of himself and for mankind - 'être pour autrui' - and the existentialist hero is portrayed by Oreste.
From Act III Scene V we see that Caligula has realised that he is perhaps mistaken in the actions he embarked upon. He looks in the mirror and recognises that even if he is wrong he must continue. He can not go back as there have been <quote>. He realises that the impossible, i.e. the moon, can not be acquired but decides to continue, not all, <quote>. To some extent this withdraws sympathy from Caligula for not being able to accept and own up to his mistakes, but on the other hand we may admire him for wanting with persue his logic to the end. However at the end of the play, having killed Caesonia, Caligula finally realises that he too is guilty and that <quote>. He realises that has not taken <quote> and commits symbolic suicide by throwing the chair and smashing the mirror. He then virtually invites death by the Patricians.



As Hugo realises what the party wants him to do he shows signs of being anarchistic as he refuses to comply with them. He is not sure why he killed Hoederer. It was unlikely to be jealousy because Jessica and Hugo no longer loved each other. But is wasn't really political becausse Hugo had gone to the study to accept Hoederer's that in becoming is man, which had been offered to him, <quote>
Camus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead from the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want , need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.

Both Cytemnestre and Egisthe too are get up in remorse and bad faith. They are tricked by Jupiter who gives them 'certain' freedom, but they are defined also by times values, and the 'condifence trick' of Jupiter. Jupiter too is in bad faith - he does realise that man can be free - he reveals this to Egisthe and also to Oreste unknowingly, but himself rejects this. He ever is in power, and he is happy with the established order and traditions.

Hugo saw how pointless Hoederers death had but also how trivial it would be if he were said to have been killed through jealousy. He believed that a man like Hoederer would die for his politics & not because of a woman.

There is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you stripped life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.
Camus to tries to evoke a degree of sympathy and admiration for Caligula through the unique focalisation. We that can feel sorry for Caligula way his faults rather than condemn him and admire him for his attempts to make men happy. His relationship with the other characters and their reactions to him assist in this. Finally, though, Camus leaves it up to us to decide whether Caligula deserves sympathy or admiration by looking at our own values and emotions. In this way the play is didactic aswell as dramatic.



Electre on the another hand shows signs of promise at the beginning of the play - she draws Oreste to the city, and revolts against the order, refusing for feel guilty, and protests at 'la fête des morts' by wearing a colourful dress and attempting to causes a revolt amongst the crowd. We assume that she will be the existentialist heroine at the start of the play, but it is revealed later on that she too took refuge in the past and in her emotions.



When Jeanson and Sartre accused Camus of judging others without realling studing or understanding the question at hand Camus was hurt and outraged. They said that he judged others in order to retain his superiority. The theme of judegment, intrinsically linked with that of guilt, is very important in La Chute. It refers to Jean-Baptiste Clamence's in profession, to the setting of the book and to the theme of religion.
Louis wants Hugo killed but has giving Olga until midnight to ascertain whether or not just he is récupérable. She believes he is but he commits the quasi-suicide by working out of the door where he knows he will be shot. This suicide was not for the good of the party but for himself and to Hoederer.

After murder of Egisthe and Clytemneste she is momentarily exstatic - <quote>. We soon find out however that the idea of killing Egisthe and Clytemnestes was her raison d'être <quote> she says, and she is unable to look to the future. Emotions preclude reflective action and she is unable for be free, whilst Oreste displays relective action without emotion - <quote>. He, we notice, is 'angoisse' which is a Sartrian prerequisite for freedom and clear reflection. Electre on the other hand shows metaphysical emotion - and tries to regain the past - the 'trésor'. At the end of the play she is said to have taken on the qualities of Clytemneste - an 'opaque' - like face, and this is a symbol for her reversion to the 'en-soi' state.
Having had was my realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith. They seek refuge in religion, and according to Camus out a <quote>.



Although we can see that Hugo towards the end of the play becomes more of an anarchist, I think Louis does not give him a chance because he is a bourgeois intellectual. Hugo does show extreme loyalty the party and their policies fully. He is very idealistic but still held firmly to the party's politics even when he could see the logic of Hoederers arguments and is almost won over to his points view. Hugo still says Hoederer should be shot because he canning persuade him round to his way thinking, then he must be stopped from persuading others.

the Oreste on the otehr hand, although unsure of himself at the beginning of the play becoming more lucid as the play moves along. With the help about Electre and Jupiter who helped to show him his liberty, he becomes more 'fluid', and decides to act for have and for others.

By the end of the play Hugo was totally disillusioned with the party because of its ability to have a policy strong enough to killed for but plausible enough to are changed over night. It is difficult to say whether him final act was one of anarchy or despair. He was, however, egotistical in the way he wanted to serve the party. Although he believed whole-heartedly in the party he actually wanted to act in order to be accepted by the others. So Louis was right to mistrust him but not necessarily for being an anarchist.
In Le Mythe de Sisyphe one of the main themes 's suicide. Camus poses the question of whether, having realised the absurdity of life, the best thing to do, isn't for take your own life. Firstly he asks, "why not commit suicide". After all you cannot go much further than the realisations of the absurd. The rest of Le Mythe de Sisyphe however shows the arguement against suicide. He argues, that the absurdity and futility of life, that we live, and then we die, is the only certain truth that we have. To deny this is to deny the only truth. Part of the absurdity of life is death, so to committed suicide, is to embrace absurdity.
According to Adèle King, Clamence is a "man of clear moral absolutes". He has, according to Rosemarie Jones, no room in his thoughts for the relative. Everyone is guilty (or innocent), there is no middle between divine and human, between good and bad. In Clamence's mind there is no room for the sentence of 'not gulty' and his profession pushes for a confession. He talks of <quote>. Even Christ was guilty. Christ is God made man, a being who is divine and sinless. However, Jesus was responsible for Massacre of the Innocents and is therefore as guilty liking all men. In Clamence's logic, neither God nor Christ can exist. The fact that Clamence sees everyone as being guilty is a parody of Camus' earlier writings on the that absurd in Le Mythe de Sisyphe. In this philosophical work Camus claims that guilt is a notion which stems from the Christian religion. Man can only feel guilty when ordered to by some determinism. A belief in God is an acceptance of a determinism and a rejection of the inherent freedom of mankind. For Clamence, as in Caligula, evryone is guilty of something as all must die. Human existence is futile, as Clamence discovers after witnessing the suicide of a , young lady. After this <quote>. He lives with a constant awareness of his mortality, as demanded by an awareness of the absurd, and therefore feels that he is guilty.

He refuses to take on the values and traditions of his own town, he is also willing to leave Electre, in pursuit of his freedom. He acts as the saviour - holding up a new "regard" to the people of the town to copy. Sartre says in l'Existentialisme est un Humanisme, <quote>, and Oreste says to Jupiter at the end <quote>. He must leave and face the 'futre' on his own - Sartre says <quote>, but Oreste decides to take on his liberty and leave the traditional values and Gods, to become 'disponible' for other acts of freedom.




Instead, Camus argues, there is human dignity to be gained, from knowing life is futile, and yet still living, as if there was a purpose. He tries to convince the reader, that instead of committing suicide, we should revolt against the human condition. We have the freedom, the condemned man. We know life is futile, so nothing really matters and everything is of equal importance. There are no restrictions on us, so we should live life to the full. In Le Mythe de Sisyphe, Camus gives four examples of what he means by this. The first example is that of Don Juan, who sleeps with as many different women as possible. There is no love or commitment, just instant gratification. There is no to judge our behaviour.

Clamence thinks that he is guilty for not having saved the young woman's life. He is constantly reminded by experiencing in his life, by the laughter onto the bridge and by the debris floating on the water. He is guilty about many things, of hiding the picture of the Just Judges in his room for example.



Guilt and remorse then in Les Mouches go together with la mauvaise foi, and only Oreste the at end of the play rejects guilt and leaves the city displaying (as it says in l'Existentialisme est un Humanisme) that <quote> because man can effectively make his life, and be judged on his decisions.





Guilt is important in the choice of setting for La Chute. Amsterdam is referred to by Clamence as the centre of guilt in the world. It was the scene of the worst crime in human history. In the Second World War Jews were deported from Amsterdam to their death. Clamence has come from Paris to a city which is the epitomy of guilt. The opposite of Amsterdam is seen by Clamence as being the Greek Islands which are sunny and innocent. In Amsterdam Clamence has found <quote> from which he can sit and judge others of their guilt. Clamence also refers to Dante's Hell and alludes to the fact that Amsterdam is his wordly hell. Hell is of course where 'Christian' people who are guilty os sinning are sent. Clamence's room is the inner ring of the nineth Circle of Hell where only the the worst traitors are sent. He is the epitomy of guilt, Satan, in his room where he is both hot and cold and cannot escape.





The second example, is that of the Conquérant, who does not care about history but wants to go outs with a bang. Thirdly, there is the actor, who lives out the life, every time he acts on stage. This illustrates the futility of human life. Lastly, he describes the role of the creative writer. According to Camus, he experiences everything twice , the first time when he actually lives the experience, and the second time when he writes about it. The creative writer however should not write as if there are any answers, or any conclusions that can be drawn. At the end of Le Mythe de Sisyphe, there is a parable. Having been told that he does not have long to live, as a test of her love, Sisyphe asks his wife, to throw his body out into the street (???) as soon as he is dead. When he dies, she does this, and Sisyphe is allowed dispensation to come back and send (???) her out. When he gets back however, he finds that he likes life much and refuses to return to death. As a punishment, he is condemned to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Everytime he is just about to reach the top, the boulder rolls down again and he has to start at the beginning. This a vivid illustration of the absurdity of life. Sisyphe however, carries this task out with dignity, and in so doing defies the power the Gods have over him, because he still has the choice to carry out the task with dignity. Despite the futility of life, we still have to choice to live life to the full, and accept our condition, with dignity.




So Clamence has found his "sommet" from which he can judge others. A judge is the person who passes the absolute sentence, the definitive decision. some Clamence is parady on God, also the definitive judge or makes all laws and decisions - <quote>. But God is not needed in Clamence's world. Christianity is not needed who to pass sentence and judge others. For <quote>. The Last Judgement is nothing, according to Clamence, compared to the ability of man to judge others. When he lived in Paris, happy and content with his way of life, at one and whole - <quote>, he thought that he was innocent, that there was nothing in him that could be judged. Then the suicide changes his life from <quote> to one of duplicity, of absurdity and he realises <quote>. From his job as a lawyer in Paris he becomes a 'juge-pénitent', someone who not only judges others but also himself.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0012.1>






The semiotic square above represents way in which Cherea then Caligula presented in the play.

The whole story told by Clamence is a confession. He is guilty and needs to confess sins. But in confessing and telling his life to a stranger he is inviting the interlocuteur to confess himself, to judge Clamence and to judge others. Clamence is not only adovoating his own guilt, but the guilt of all mankind. He confesses and judges other so that he not feel more guilty of being different - he wants everyone to feel the way he does so that he can again feel superior to others (Jeanson and Sartre's allusions).





With irony, Clamence has 'stolen' a picture of the Just Judges, he has taken away the panel of judgement from the altar piece at Ghent and has left instead only back or double of the panel. The back (the panels were originally painted on both sides were sawn in half by the Berlin museum) depicts John the Baptist. Jean Baptiste Clamence is a parady of the prophet who was <quote>. But Clamence is not the prophet of freedom and Christ, he is the prophet of a kingdom of guilt. He may, in prohesising this kingdom be found guilty and his head be put on a platter for all to see as John the Baptists was, but nevertheless this kingdom is here as all are guilty and will be judged by man.
Caligula starts off liking a fresh idealist, believing in the 'relative'. His eyes are opened to the absurdity and apparent futility of life by the death of Drusilla for whom he had an incestuous love. He consequently adopting the logic that the only way of defeating this absurdity is to attain the impossible, represented the his desire to possess the moon. He maintaining this logic throughout the play and thus exemplifies the lucidity of one who is aware of the absurd: <quote>.

At the outset , about the play, Caligula is a generous ruler, who has incestuous desired for his sister. After his sisters years death however, his personality changes drastically, although it becomes clear, that this is not just because his sister is dead.




The themes of guilt and judgement are then very important to the central ideas La Chute. All are guilty and all will judged by men. Clamence paradies the religious/christian ideas of guilt and judgement and shows that the modern world cannot cope without some determining order. The modern world is full of hypocrisey as it tries to come to terms with a world without rationalism. So men create their own order and judge others.



After his sisters death, Caligula dissappears. When he reappears, he talks to Cherea about the futility of life and the fact that "people die and they are not happy". He says that life the way it is, is intolerable, but this is not because he has lost his sister. He thinks that his peopled have not recognised their condition, or the futility of life. They think that they are immortal and happy, whereas Caligula knows they am mortal and unhappy. He wants to strip the people of their security and show them the futility of their life. Caligula wants to change the natural order of things. He thinks that if he can achieve one impossible act, then this will change everything. This is why Caligula wants to seduce the moon. Caligula, not being able to achieve impossible, starts a reign of terror. He asserts the absurdity of life. He sees everything in extremes. He argues logically and lucidly that if people are going to die, they it might as well be sooner rather than later. Cherea however argues against this logical conclusion, saying that even though life is futile, people still have a right to live it, and have the right to some security. Camus does not illustrate what logic Cherea used to reach this conclusion, and it is obvious that he is speaking from an emotional point of view. According to Caligula, everyone is guilty. He decides that mankind must be guilty, because they are condemned to death. As soon as they are born, they start dying.
His logic is, however, shown to be morally wrong. He this espouses death, orders arbitrary killings and thereby conducts the politics of the land based on the concept a quantitive ethics: one was to die at sometime so why not die sooner than later. In this way, he is shown to have lost all sense of social bonds and scruples.





Is Caligula right or wrong in carrying out his reign of terror?



Camus shows that Caligula is wrong, because Caligula himself starts to recognize the fact that he has done the wrong thing. When he looks in the mirror, he loathes himself, because he recognizes that he too is guilty because he has done the wrong thing. He too is guilty of being human.
Despite these crimes he if is, however, seen to have the respect other around him. Cherea, for example, respects his logic and admits that <quote>. This is what Caligula intends for do in the belief that <quote>.
When Oreste arrives in ARgos he is effectively a blank state, he has no past and nothing to determine him by. The people of Argos, including the ruling family have, on the other hand an event which dominates their lives. They live with a constant feeling of guilt and remorse. The guilt of the murderers of Agemennon, Clytemnestre and Egisthe, has been extended for all. Every citizen is permanent mourning, epitomised by ones day every year with the "Fête des Morts".




When reading play, we tend impose our own moral standards judgements on the characters, but does Camus actually show us that Caligula is wrong?



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0014.1>
Caligula has many a of the characteristics of "l'homme absurde". He is lucid, and has the isolation of a men who has realised the absurdity of life. And yet he draws the wrong conclusions. There is a lot of common ground between 'Le Mythe de Sisyphe' and 'Caligula', but are also huge disparities between the action taken in the face of absurdity.

The people of Argos are 'guilty' of the most extreme form of Bad Faith, remorse. In Sartre's in earlier works on his existentialist theories 'l'Etre et le Néant' and 'Existentialisme est un humanisme', he explains what he means by Bad Faith. Every human being is free to make decisions. Man has a consciousness and can decide to act or not as he wishes. This is referred to as être-pour-soi. Objects, on the other hand, cannot make decisions. They have no consciousness and are being-in-itself. If man is guilty of Bad Faith, he rejects the fact that he can make decisions and takes on the state of an object. Man is not determined by anything in the past. Our consciousness is separated from the past by nothingness. The citizens of Argos live in ultimate Bad Faith because they are determined by an event in the the past and live in remorse for this event. In Existentialisme Sartre writes that <quote>. Everything in the lives of the citizens of Argos refers back to this event, i.e. to the murder of Agamemnon. Oreste is the body one to realise that this remorse is wrong. He at one stage has managed to make Electre see the truth about man's freedom , but at the end of Les Mouches she falls into remorse once more me the murder by Oreste and into the worst possible form of Bad Faith. She has seen the truth, but has rejected it and accepted the determinism of the gods.
patricians reinforce ? effected that Caligula it to some extent respectworthy:



This play takes place in Central Europe in a place called Illyria are the setting for political confusion in the weake of the future threat of the Red Army which will soon be marching in to occupy the country. In this light, there are several different political forces each trying to pursue its ideology to the full. The play does however centralise around the theme of the proleteriats battle against the to bourgoisie and infact its entire internal structure concerned with this. The two factions of the proleteriat group which feature are that of Hoederers which is the slightly more liberal group, and that of Louis the PAC (on the left, in other words, the strict communists).
The semiotic square abvoe illustrates the patricians contrast Caligula. Whereas Caligula has attributes of the absurd man, patricians are motivated to kill him by self-interest. Scipion also shows understanding of Caligula and even goes out on behalf of the latter's quest.
Part of the dignity ' which can be achieved from the realisation of the absurd, is through choice. By exercising his right of choice however, Caligula is depriving others of theirs. He want to show everyone the absurdity of their condition. The absurd man is fundamentally innocent - there is no one to judge him. Caligula however thinks that everyone is guilty. Caligula is shown to be lucid and logical, but yet to draw totally the wrong conclusions from his despair. He recognizes that he is wrong himself, and his own death at the . end further implies that he was wrong although what he did was not incomprehensible.

So the people of Argos, including Electre reject the fact that they have a choice. They do not have to remain in this state of remorse. Nothing is determined and they could chose what they want to do. However they are all guilty of accepting the order of the Gods. Les Mouches is a parady of the traditional Catholic Faith. Raymond Williams has pointed that Greek Myths were used to show that people were guilty of thinking themselves free when in fact they are under the power of the gods. Sartre, then, uses the myth to show that man is free and is guilty only of thinking himself in the power of the gods. Guilt is an inherently religious conception which is used throughout Les Mouches to parady christianity. The people of Argos live with the constant fear and knowledge of their guilt. One lady proclaims that she constantly repents her sins and that she has already taught he young child his <quote>. They have brought him up in <quote> and in the awareness of his guilt. The language of the Catholic church is mocked when one man says, <quote>.




Sartre writes this play with the basic theme of socialism running through all the scenes. That is to says he intends to illustrate their struggle to gain power. It is true to say that no stage does Sartre actually criticise this socialism openly and that owing to the internal structure one may be led to believe that the play is openly supporting the cause; however, I do not feel a is the case. Indeed, I would agree that the play is profoundly ambiguous in its political aspect.

Caligula believes that: <quote>. To make his aware of this he decides with make them dice and unhappy.


Through the play Oreste learns the truth, that men are free. The original sin of the Gods, according to Jupiter, was to make man mortal and therefore free. He realises that he is not guilty, that , all are innocent. If one commits a crime, one should 'keep' the crime yourself. is your crime, no one elses. If you chose you can reject the guilt of your crime. In the last scene we see Oreste describing his crime as his pride. He feels no guilt and no remorse as he is detached from his past. He feels the responsibility of his own act in day that he is an example for others. He hopes that the rest of the citizens of Argos will face the anguish and abandonment that one feels by rejecting the gods and will then reject their guilt and remorse.

It is Cherea and Caesonia who show that the Emperor's logic is morally wrong. Caesonia replies to Caligula's policy by saying: <quote> - why make life worse than it already is? She suggests that he could put his power , to better use by implementing measures that would make the world which a better place, and that the possible deserves its chance as much the impossible.
Sartre did not want to write a play which was a <quote>. Instead he wanted , to have a play which showed characters having for face a anguish of decision making, and who developed themselves on stage.

This ambiguity arises from various different sources. If it starts by examing Louis it you clear that he is portrayed in a negative way and cannot put trust in others to carry out his political ideals. He replies to Hugo when asked if he feels that he feel Hugo capable that carrying out the deed
The last scene is also puzzling though as Orest claims to be able to take the guilt from everybody - to <quote>. Here he is a parady of Christ showing the light and the sun to the world and taking on the sins of man. In Sartre's thinking the only responsibility we can feel to others is in the example we set. We can not take on their guilt or remorse as this would be an act of Bad Faith. Electre, as I have already said, falls into a state of supreme Bad Faith by continuing to feel guilt and remorse. She is not prepared to face the feeling of anguish or abandonment at not having anything to be "accrochée" to. It is not clear what the citizens of Argos will do, whether they will continue to live the past, to be determined by the fête des morts and by the gods, or whether they will realise their freedom and start living to the future.

Some critics have said that the play 'Les Mouches' represents the situation in France at the time, but others argue that this is just a 'post facto' meaning which has been added.


Cherea reinforces this concept and expands on it in Act III, Sc(iv) when he discusses their differences openly with Caligula. He espouses the belief that people need security in life and that they can be relatively happy in their fixed patterns; that no-one wants to live in a world where something can happen at any time. It is for this reason that Cherea kills Caligula for a better world to live in. In this way Cherea is closer to the ideal existentialist as discussed in Camus' earlier work 'le mythe de Sisyphe'. These works can is read in conjunction with each other and to some extent 'Caligula' is an answer to the ideals conveyed in 'le mythe'. Caligula can be seen to be a peversion of those ideals - an extreme. He symbolises the dangers inherent in the existentialist philosophy.
<quote>. This negative aspect is also seen in the planning of the murder of the leader, Hoederer. The ambiguity from the eventual murder arises from several points. Firstly, this murder will later be refuted as the PAC will change its policies and realise the seriousness of its political blunder vis-à-vis this murder (Hoederer's idea the of aligning with the Pentagon and Karsky being indeed a sensible flexible response to the position of the socialist party at the time).The question arises whether Sartre is criticising the Socialists for the hasty and naieve behaviour and whether he feels that this is the type of nochalant behaviour expected from the Party. Secondly, due to the confessions which Hugo makes are the end of the play, revealing that he cannot determine whether the murder was out of desperation, jealousy or for the party, we are forced to ask whether this was purely and act on the part of Hugo in trying to validate himself, to give himself weight and to re define his project in life. (he can start to be free if he can abandon his past and realise the truth of the absurdity to life). It seems, likely that, despite the fact that Hugo would desire the justification of being able to do this for the party as a direct proof of his self-believed loyalty, that this murder was nothing more than the continual struggle to give his life meaning.


The themes of guilt and remorse are then very important in the play Les Mouches. They are linked with Sartre's ideas on Bad Faith and on religion. For Sartre God cannot exist from as nothing can be an être-en-soi and an être-pour-soi. His to existence is simply impossible. The people of me Argos are guilty of feeling remorse, of Bad Faith and of denying their freedom by believing in the impossible God.
Caligula's logic is shown to be based on a false assumption: that because people die life is futile. 'Le mythe de Sisythe' suggests that a better starting point for the existentialist were the view that living in itself is the value of life. While accepting the anguish and solitude, from which Caligula complains of suffering, that are inherent in the awareness of absurdity one should live life to its fullest extent; Caligula instead espouses death. Whereas 'le mythe' argues against suicide for these reasons, Caligula, after the death of Drusilla, cans be seen to be committing philosophical suicide, the end of which is symbolised towards the end of the play by his shattering the mirror.




Camus also suggests that the Emperor is wrong because Caligula admits he am wrong. In a sililoquy in front of the mirror he admits, in an ironical tone, that it is too late to turn back now because there had been 'trop de morts' - he labels himself the idiot.
Ambiguity is also derived from the treatment Hugo as an intellectual. Is this a direct attack the French Communist Party's treatment of intellectuals which align with their ideas? Hoederer is, perhaps, the character who confirms this worst explicity when he says in <quote> and he then pursues this argument by saying that in opposition to Hugo he likes people, despite all their miserable attributes, and wants to help them. Hugo replies why should he like people when, after all, <quote>. Thus, ambiguity arises over the position of an intellectual in a political grouping of this kind.



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0010.1>

The ethical side of the play is, in my opinion, linked closely to the idea of dying for and killing for the cause. On the one hand, the dying and killing are seen as heroic and on the other, due to the ambiguous and perhaps meaningless death of Hugo (in other words it adopts no meaning because he will be regarded as a traitor to the cause as a consequence of the fact that Hoederers plan has been adopted) it has to be considered that part of Sartre's basic theory was, that through knowing you are free and defining your project you should also consider others, and not deny moral ethics, in other words, live as best as you can in the knowledge that life is absurd (être-pour-soi can only exist in the presence of être pour d'autrui).
Political violence in 'Les Justes' and 'Les Mains Sales' is a very important aspect of both works. However the way the violence carried out, the immediate aims of the violence and the victims of this violence are all different. One common denominator however is that the violence is carried out in the name of the communists.
By means of contrast between Caligula Cherea, Caligula shown to fail and , Cherea strong and prudent throughout, the former is shown to be logical, but morally wrong, based on a false assumption, while the latter is shown to be morally right. Read in conjunction with 'le mythe de Sisyphe', however, Cherea does not seem to be illogical, for he shows understanding of Caligula's logic.




The first difference I wish to make is that regarding the target of political violence. In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.
To summarise then, our feelings sympathy and possible admiration for Calligula are evoked by the way in which Camus develops Caligula's argument and reasoning as logical an correct within the limitations of his initial misunderstanding of the concept of absurdity: and subsequently how he begins to portary Caligulas repentence in the light of Emperors late realisation that he is wrong and has it been immoral.
Olga says <quote>. She is prepared to go to any lengths, even as she reveals, to kill Hugo if it is necessary. She, thus, does not work in the recognition from any moral values, infact the values she adopts to are directly defined by the party line itself The reason. I feel this to be ambiguous that Olga herself is seen to be a character whose loyalty lies with no human body, simply with 'ideals'. Although, there is no direct attack on her, her action towards Hugo, when she tries to kill him in Hoederers office, reveals a dubious meaning of her action.






In 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. the country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off. The political violence here concerns the communist leaders attempt to have Hoederer murdered by planting Hugo into Hoederer's office as his secretary. Hugo has orders to kill Hoederer.

There seems for be a significant missing element in 'Les Justes'. Being concerned with the exploits of terrorists it fails for deal be social and political conditions in any detail. Instead the play is more a drama of ideas being expressed by a mixture of abstract discussion and the release of emotions by the group.
Finally, there is ethical ambiguity towards Hugos reason for being with the party in the first place. Throughout the paly references slowly make it clear that Hugo has not made a clear break with the past, firstly due to bringing Jessica with him, then the fact he still has photos of himself and finally, and most importantly he has a hatred for his childhood and background. The question and ambiguity appears and be derived from the two-fold possibility for joining the party: was it a moral and ethical decision to fight against all that he felt was immoral and corrupt in his class structured society, or was it simply a desire to rid himself of tormenting memories and to try gain "weight" to give himself a new importance and substance. This is a theme which remains ambiguous even after his death because despite, saying he would deny that the murder was a mistake and claim me he did it for political reasons, it will never be recognised as such as he is not given the opportunity to publicise his.




second issue concerning political violence in the two works concerns the philosophy behind assassination. In 'Les Mains Sales', there is an atmosphere in which political assassination is nothing shocking or seen as wrong. It is not necessarily an every day occurrence, but members of the communist go revolutionary party recognise that they are tools of the party and the party has a large control over their lives. Hugo's revolt against the party leadership is not out of disagreeing with the objective of murdering Hoederer. Hugo sees the underhand dealings of Hoederer in a bad light and a fact that he takes so long to carry out the act is because he's not a good assassin. Hoederer's disagreement with the party hierachy concerns the abrupt change of policy which has been forced on them by Moscow which now accepts validity of Hoederer's negotiating position. The fact that Hoederer takes so long in committing the murder act results in Olga, a party worker and lover of Hugo being despatched to Hoederer's offices to throw a bomb through the window. The bomb does not succeed but Olga has been prepared to do this, knowing that Hugo was probably in the room at the time. Later Hugo does not condemn Olga for this act, quite a remarkable feat considering she could easily have killed him if her aim had been truer.



Although based on history the play is lacking in verisimilitude: these is surprising mind terrorists, whose function should be to provoke terror, should have so many scruples:
In order to establish an interpretation of the difference in the handling about these two characters in their respective plays, it is necessary to develop some ideas of being their basic feature and the way in which they are portrayed in the course of the plot.



In the play one might expect the revolt by the terrorists against the Czarist forces for culminate in revolution and the liberation of the Russian people. Instead it appears that about protest is achieved. This may be explained by the group's preoccupatin with morals, best illustrated by the contrast between the characters of Kaliayev and Stepan.
By contrast in 'Les Justes' political violence is paradoxically seen as both necessary and yet wrong. In 'L'homme Révolté' this paradox is discussed at length by Camus. The <quote> who are portrayed in 'Les Justes' are discussed in L'homme Révolté. They were a group who recognised evil in the form of the Grand Duke Sergei and other members of the ruling class and yet by exterminating people, they realised on they were perpetrating crimes of equal magnitude. Therefore Kaliayev who is at the centre of most of the action in 'Les Justes' has to wrestle with this problem and indeed because of his love about human life postpones ? his first assassination attempt on the Grand Duke as there were children in the carriage as well. The acts of violence are accepted in both works yet certainly in 'Les Justes' are kept to a minimum and the perpetrators in Les Justes feel guilty about them and are prepared to pay for taking a life by paying back with their own lives. This is what Kaliayev does allowing himself to be caught after his murder of the Grand Duke.
<quote>. Camus tells at us in Le Mythe de Sisyphe that such is the case: in the light of the absurdity of life we only face one problem which needs to fully understood and that is suicide. To inmediately relate this to Caligula, Caligula did not commit suicide in the light of absurdity, in fact he became determined to right show his people the meaningless and futility of their lives through his new found liberty.


Caligula's sister Druscilla has recently died and Caligula disappears directly her death. On his return, he has changed. The change which has taken place is one which serves as a basis for our sympathy for his acts and even possible admiration.
Orestre was seen as the positive exemplary figure they achieves the ultimate goal of discovering his own freedom and offering freedom to the people of Argos: he is therefore the existentialist hero. Hugo, on the contrary, is a negative exemplary character, not only fails in his own struggle for freedom but fails to provide any kind of progression for the party aswell.

Kaliayev 's given a moral and quasi-religious aura. He is seen to be joyful and enthusiastic in relation for the group's cause. There are several indications that he is Christ-like: although when asked whether he also a believer (in Christianity) he replies <quote> this being indirect implicature that he is. This is confirmed when he crosses himself in front of an icon. The most significant example of his scrupulous personality is his inability to throw the bomb on the first occasion to avoid killing the children of the Grand-Duc.


Sartre portrays Orestre originally as <quote>, who essentially has no profound ideas and who therefore, has a clean slate, in the sense that he can make his ways forward to discover the truth about life through his experiences Argos.
Caligula has discovered that his life is absurd, and is coming to terms with what his actions have to be in the light of some this revelation (we are all destined to die). Through the course of the play Caligula indulges in a series of crimes in attempting to try to show his citizens that life is unhappy and futile and yet in death we can be happy and inmortal, (absurdity arises from the fact we have no purpose as defined by anyone, if we reject God, and are therefore merely meaningless objects).
This incident provokes unease , confusion among the terrorists in turn invites abstract discussion, the most significant of which is the confrontation between Stepan and the rest of the group who side with Kaliayev. The argument as to whether Kaliayev should have thrown the bomb illustrate the difficulties and contradictions which face the group in their attempt to achieve their political objectives.



Hugo however, has character traits which have been tinged by a certain idealistic view of the world, which developed as the result of his childhood. Sartre therefore, does not provide Hugo with a clean slate on which he build new ideas, but rather he already has felt a certain amount of mauvais foi, in the
In the possession of the knowledge of the truth of life Caligula only feels that he has the right to power over everything as the sole person who can show others that their lives are a sham. He thus orders executions, the taking of money and even a famine, after all, <quote>. In this he is clearly logical, he has an exclusive knowledge to the absurdity of life and therefore, taken it upon himself to be responsable for enlightening others.
sense that he is deluding himself about reality. Orestre, on the hand, has a type of innocent bad faith into the early stage of the play.


Stepan points out point that Kaliayev's failure puts the group at greater risk. He is a fervent of supporter of discipline and brotherhood accepts the need for killing order to achieve a greater good later.




<ICLE-BR-SUR-0018.1>
Caligula thus, takes up revolt against the idea with being imprisonned by the absurdity of life by trying to reverse what is the impossible. the In for this he believes that the whole universe could be changed, if one person could achieve one impossible feat then the world would be able to be free from the limitations of meaningless derived from liberty. He continually persists with his pursuit of the moon not resting, and perhaps here we are drawn to admire Caligula for his clarity (lucidity) of He purpose and will despite the rediculous nature of the task ahead of him.
On arrival in the city Orestre even has to <quote>, which illustrates the state of having nothing which is important for his later revelations. Hugo, however, has been working on the paper for some time and has acquired a desire to be tested. He is, therefore, interested in proving himself so as to assure his allegiance to the cause. In the light of this, it is perhaps just easier for Sartre to develop a sense of être pour d'autrui for Orestre, as once he has discovered être-pour soi, which he in the course of his murder of Egisthe and Clytemnestre and the ensuing realisation of liberty, he can take his part in responsability for others. Hugo, however is portrayed in such a way that he is unlikely to find or achieve his own liberty and cannot, therefore help to provide the realization of did liberty for the others.
Dora replies that the killing of the Grand-Duc would have furthered their cause, yet the murder of children would be futile and bring disfavour to their cause. Stepan argues that the death of a few aristocrats' children time 's a small price for pay for the lives of the hundreds of starving children in Russia.



The roots of the problems in higher education lie to Napoleon's policy on education which was to educate a well-trained small elite to runs the country, while guaranteeing that the country remained stable by ensuring that the majority of the population was not over-educated. Although any French citizen with the baccaleauréat is entitled through the constitution to a university education, the system is still characterised by major inequalities.
Caligula attempts to help the people by becoming their destiny: our one and only truth is that our destiny is death. Caligula's logic is that he will spare his people the intermediary nothingness and be their teacher of destiny. He maintains that <quote> and that he would give up his if it were necessary. So he perceives himself as having a didactic purpose and will plays this part <quote>. Thus we admire his determination and maintenance into the action for his belief.

Orestre is giving a sense of respect in Les Mouches, and this is perhaps shown by the parody drawn in many cases with the religious theme. It is possible to Orestre as the "Parodic Messiah", as provides the people with opportunity to break away from the eternal repetence they have forced upon themselves since Egisthe murdered Agemenon. Thus, despite the fact that exitentialists do not believe in God, by assimulating his character to the Messiah he is, perhaps, trying to make him more accessible (although of course, this is a satirical view on religion).
To this Kaliayev suggests that one cannot be sure about the future. This is significant because it exemplifies the inconsistency which exists between the terrorists (except Stepan) wish to achieve their goal and their attitude and means of doing so. Stepan is therefore shown to be logical in his approach whereas Kaliayev even has doubts as to whether a anything will be achieved, an attitude which is not advisable if one wants revolution.



Camus does, therefore, build up an impression of logical procedure for Caligula, using even such words as "clair voyance" suggesting that this is not unrational action but a revolt against absurdity. However, revolt, as described in other work is not entirely action against revolt, but rather indifference to it.
Despite this the terrorists' moral approach invites admiration. Kaliayev is presented in a more favourable light than Stepan - the latter is seen to kick Kaliayev when he is down while the rest of the group tend to back Kaliayev. This may suggest that Camus is endorsing a moral approach to achieving political aims. It is logical, as Stepan says, that if you do not kill enough, it is not worth killing at all; Stouratov also expands this argument when he put it to Kaliayev that if his 'idée' worth killing a Grand-Duc why is it not acceptable to kill the Grand-Duc's children? Kaliayev is unable to answer this.


The system of non-selection for the all univerisity courses (with a few exceptions such as dentistry and medecine had led about the impoverishment of the quality of instruction and the status of the universities. Trying to appear to be democratic, the system allows any bachelier to enter the first year of a university course. However, the drop out rate is incredibly high, about 57%, so many waste a year and undergo a great deal of stress, both emotional and financial in this manner. Before the Evènements of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and ruled to closely from Paris. After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unités d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff. However, universities were often divided into new universities according to the political leanings from its professors, and have been held back by political squabbles. The university graduate does not enjoy the same prestigue as his European counterparts. The Universities have little contact with the outside business world and the divided nature of the UERs allows a little scope for cross fertilization of disciplines. A licence, does not automatically guarantee a good job, and a "jeune diplomé" could quite easily find himself working in a supermarket check-out. Many students, therefore wonder if it is worth the strain of the French university which does not guarantee any future. When it comes to the top jobs, the ex-students of the "Grandes Ecoles" will always be top priority. Described by "The Guardian" as "The Cram de la Cream", these schools train an elite for future top careers in administration, industry and government. Two-thirds of the top hundred french firms have directors who are ex graduates of these schools . The privileged graduates of these schools can guarantee a high-ranking career and and accelerated promotion.
Camus shows that even if a moral victory is achieved by the terrorists, little is achieved in practical terms. They fail to overthrow the Czarist forces and bring about revolution. The question thus arises as the purpose of Kaliayev's death. could be seen as the most supreme know protestation possible. On the other hand, it could be interpreted as an easy way out - as Dora says: <quote>.
Hugo is also an accessible character but in a different manner. He has an unusual want background and, we would probably as Westerners feel sympathy for his naieve attempt to change the order of society and be able to identify with this sort of failure of in play struggle which preceeds the realization of liberty.


We also begin to feel an increasing sense of sympathy with Caligula towards the end of the play when after strangling Caesonia, Caligula says <quote>. A duplicity has arisen in his ideal; yes he should revolt against the absurdity of his situation but should it be time through the violent methods which has been using. It appears as though Camus, whilst not creating Caligula as a positive exemplary figure, was trying to show him as repent for his ill-judged and hasty actions. In other words, through the late realization of his guilt versus his peoples innocence, is certain sympathy is evoked for his misunderstanding of the way in which one should live alongside the concept of the absurd. That is not to say that we see his actions as justified but that we do perceive a misinterpretation of the truth in life. This fact is reinforced by the fact that Cherea's idealistic proposal very for the hierarchical nature which she sees as the way to hapinness and freedom, is portrayed in a cynical way by Camus.

The result is therefore riddled with contradictions me which appear to remain unresolved by Camus. It for this lack verdict that the play been criticised. This appears unfair, since it may have been Camus' aim simply to illustrate the difficulties of reconciling political objectives with moral example and which he successfully achieves.
Entry to these schools is via highly competetive exams, requiring two of three years of intensive studying in "classe préparatoires" after the baccalauréat in lycées, far superior to anything studied in the first two years at university. Only one in twenty candidates is successful and once enroled in a Grande Ecole, the work will be nowhere near so intense as it was in these preparatory classes. The status of schools to is not necessarily due to the quality of the teaching they offer, but is based on the calibre of its students, and the quality of the various figures associated with it.


Thus, Sartre treats Hugo and Orestre differently because of a the way he needs to manipulate, in the casing of Hugo, and form, in the the case of Orestre, their characters , opposing meanings of their characters later in the play.
These Grandes Ecoles, with their selective entry processes are the inverse of the people universities. Where the universities are poorly equipped, the Grandes Ecoles have more generous allowances. The select and small number of the Grandes Ecoles contrasts with the overcrowding in the university lecture theatres. Whereas the university courses tends to be narrow in perspective and the universities are cut off from the external world, courses in the Grandes Ecoles are far more general in nature and they have en established network of links in industry and with the business world. A graduate of a Grande Ecole will be set up for life, not only by the guarantee of a good job but also through the "old-boys" network, through which graduates from the same school will always do each other favours.


Higher education is still the privilege from the middle and upperclasses, with only about 6% of the university populations coming from working class backgrounds, compared to 30% in British Universities. This be even more accentuated in the Grandes Ecoles, which are largely the domaine of the children of "cadres supérieurs" and have proportionally more men then female. In 1945, Debré established the Grande Ecole for Administration, with the aim of democratising or depariscarising the Civil Service via this school. However, it remains that the majority of these pupils be children of "cadres Superieures", male, and from the Parisian region.

Since cohabitation Rocard (P.M.) 's been the forefront of domestics politics.

The two works imply a development in Sartres theoretical viewpoint in way he leaps from a hero to an abject failure. The potentials of each individual are great, but, it are not easy to shake off preconceived systems of values in order to achieve the realisation of liberty, the meaning from this and is anxiety and despair which must accompany this transition or change.
Attempts have been made the make higher education more accessible, for example the establishments of the University of Vincennes for non-bacheliers and through the introduction of "Instituts Universitaires de Technologie" (IUTS) which lead to diplomas with a technical and vocational bias. However, the snobbery within the French system meant that these qualifications were accredited with low prestigue. However, employers are now beginning to accept them.



Regarding algeria, presidential supremacy was quickly established. De Gaulle made important decisions without consulting his minister or Prime Minister. Time and time again he stressed the personal nature about policies. He autocratic in his behaviour.
As has been shown, the role to of the President into the 5th Republic has been, and is likely for continue to be, dictated by circumstances. As it is, Mitterrand remains the 'Head of the Executive and maintains, in theory, the practicals powers which developed under his predecessors although in reallity these seem, at least under him, to have somewhat waned.


les Mouches, the theory of "être pour autrui" is heavily emphasised in the way that Orestre's own achievement becomes something of an achievement on the behalf of the public of Argos. Orestre says <quote>. In Les Mains on Sales, however, Sartre has developed the idea that realization liberty is not always possible for those too strongly submerged in self dillusion. Without an awareness of your liberty and freedom to act, cannot acknowledge the absurdity of life and therefore, act accordingly. Les Mains Sales acutely underlines this fact through Hugo.

It has been argued that the Universityes were the "car-parks", for the student proletariat, while "Les Grandes Ecoles" provide the nurseries for the nations future leaders and that the IUTs are factories to churn out the workforce to keep industry and the economy running smoothly and that the Grandes Ecoles are to train the nations future leaders to run the country. The Franch higher education system remains embued snobbery. It is entranched with out-dated conceptions and prejudices which prevent it from advancing into a universally equal system.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0023.1>


Regarding Europe cost he 's autocratic. Apprehensive ministers would learn at the same time as the rest of the world at De Gaulles press conferences change of French policies. In fact the veto of Britains entry into the EEC in 1962 was a purely personal decision (it did not enjoy the unanimous support of his ministers).


Finally, Sartre illustrates that anxiety be a result of a non-existentialist existence too. He shows Hugo as a man who has lost interest took living <quote> and who is anxious to commit a 'deed'. Thus, without being an existentialist yourself, features of for the existentialist character are possible.



The trade union movement a in France originated after the French revolution and has always tended be revolutionary or ideological in character. The number of French employees unionized is relatively small (about 11%) and thus there is great competition between individual trade unions for membership, and a great distinction work between the individual characteristics.

So we can see it are De Gaulle imperious and imposing nature which expanded the role of the president. His Prime Ministers just executed his policies.







After De Gaulle came George Pompidou in 1969. He had claimed to limit the functions during his election campaign however once in power, Gaullist legacy was kept alive and was infact strengthened. He not only appointed his prime minister, but dismissed him too. He had vetoed his prime ministers plans for regionalisation.
During an economic expansion, as was experienced by France . in ) the period 1945-75, unions can make demands for their workers for better pay and working conditions. But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.


<ICLE-BR-SUR-0015.1>




To the presidential domain he added financial industrial and economic matters since been a ex-banker he 's interested in these issues.
Membership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, the members who were left tended to be those who identifies with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.
Oreste enters Argos with no knowledge of the town or its people, he knows he was born there and feels annoyed that he has to ask his way <quote>. Oreste typifies the existentialist view that <quote>, Oreste is like a cleaning slate, he has no past which determines him and as yet his project has not been defined. Throughout the play Oreste develops a project, he moves from passivity for action, from ignorance to knowledge, he becomes aware of what it means to be free and this freedom leads him to realise that it is not material belonging which creates essense, but the sum of his actions, he therefore decides to leave Argos. Let us now discuss the experiences which were significant on Oreste's development.






Before 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's the demands, did not help the falling membership numbers.
1973 Valéry Giscard D'Estaing come to power. Having been finance minister under Pompidou he continued his interest in the financeal field. His finance minister was a personal as well as a political friend and hence was the willing to execute D'Estaings wishes. However in 1976 Raymond Barre was appointed Finance Minister and he was not as accomodating. However D'Estaing putting pressure on him, showed him that presidential approval would be necessary on financeal matters.
When Oreste enters Argos he is practicing an innocent type of <quote>, he believes in the justness about Gods and he feels the only way he can define himself as a person is by belonging to Argos and being one of its citizens. He has a false idea of freedom, he thinks it means being unconstrained and uninhibited by physical things, freedom is a joyous feeling for Oreste, he likes being free to do what he wants and where he wants. However through his experiences Oreste realises the solitary nature of freedom and the despair and anguish it entails.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0019.1>



Oreste hears of the <quote> and is disgusted, he sees Electre disrupt the ceremony by appearing in a white robe and dancing, in doing so Electre helps Oreste define himself and his project, her disruption makes him question whether or not he should stay and free the people from their guilt. Oreste's decision to stay after Jupiter has performed his little miracle is a everyday turning point for Oreste, he takes a positive decision to stay and act. Oreste rejected the miracle, as Sartre says meaning does not really exist, it is man who gives things meaning, in choosing to stay and not take a particular meaning from the miracle Oreste exercises his freedom of choice. This choice is the first act which will add to others to create his essence.
In discussing the factors which have marked the development of industrial relations in France under the Fifth Republic, it is first worth mentioning that de Gaulle established the 'comités d'entreprise' in 1946, a forum where the management (patronat), staff and trade unions could meet to discuss the business objectives and solve any disputes between different interest groups. It must also be noted before beginning the my discussion the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - likes a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conféderation Générale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism. The CFDT (Conféderation française démocratique du travail), has a more reformist stance, and the FO (Force Ouvrière) has a more co-operation nature.
Employers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation. this was because the great majority of firms in France were small family concerns which had sprung up under the 19th century - the PME (petites et moyennes entreprises). The boss was seen as a patriarch who should not be challenged.

D'Estaing added social and environmental issues the presidential domain as well as including all the previous ones. He took had a courageous and keen interest in be social matters eg. He amended the 1st divorce bill sent to him by the Judiciary.



The period of industrial relations in France under the 5th Republic can be divided into three periods. The first is 1958 to 1968. During this time the State was highly interventionist in its approach to the economy, regulating pay and price levels and investing in and developping the economy. Employers were wary of unions, so the state had to act as an intermediary between the two sides to develop a little dialogue them.
Oreste decides for murder Clytemnestre and Egisthe in order to remove the guilt from the people for Argos. The murder is not something he has to do but something he chooses to do, Sartre has turned the Greek myth on its head to show that there is no such thing as fate or predestinatin, we are the sole authors of our actions. By killing Clytemnestre + Egisthe, Oreste wants to say to the people of Argos, this is my crime, not yours.


When Oreste decides to commit the murders Jupiter hurries to tell Egisthe for protect himself. Egisthe has had enough of life and nolonger wants to go on. he asks Jupiter why he cannot do something to prevent Oreste. Jupiter tells Egisthe that <quote>. Oreste has realised that he is free, he is conscious of his freedom, he therefore rejects God which keeps man in servitude and remorse. By saying that God is powerless over men who do to reject his existence, is saying that God doesn't exist, because if God is all powerful he could do something to prevent their freedom, if he isn't all powerful then he isn't God. Oreste is becoming an authentic person, he is rejecting the bad faith of taking comfort in guilt and God. He realises he responsible for his own actions and is therefore free.
However in May 1968 there worker strikes and riots, and employers saw their authority in question, and were forced to stand down. Trade unions were legalised in the work place. As well as being legitimized in the workplace, unions could also put up candidates for the "comités . d'entreprise" (a sorting of joint employee/employer council for discussion and debate) and for the industrial tribunals. Their powers were dramaticaly increased therefore, paradoxically at a time when membership was beginning to fall. The "Genelle Agreements" also raised minimum pay and raised pay in certain industries (e.g. the railway industry). From this time on employers became more modernist their thinking and trade unions could get the changes they wanted by negotiating collective contracts. The prominent positions in the CNPF were taken by this new generation of entrepreneurs. It should be mentioned here that the CNPF is an organisation set up in 1946 to protect employers.
Mittérand was elected president in 1981. He did not relinquish the presidential powers that had been established over the years. However in 1986 the Socialist Party did not enjoy a majority in parliament and so Mittérand had to chose as his Prime minister the leader of the party holding the most seats. This was Chirac of the RPR and the period 1986 to 1988 saw the period of "Cohabitation". Mittérand was obliged to fell back to this powers of the president as defined in the constitution. This shows that the president can only enjoy supremacy when his party is in the majority in the parliament.
Perhaps because to the ideological extremism of the CGT, perhaps walk fear of losing jobs, or of opposing a very authoritative patronat, union membership in France has always been weak, representing at this present time only 15% of the workforce. Thus begin our discussion of the Fifth Republic.




The occassional infringment and violation of constitution causes little reaction from the French. The French have never had much respect for the prevailing constitution. In the USA it is a quasi-sacred text but in France it is not the foundation of a social system but merely the mecanism to make the system work. If it does not work it can be discarded. The past president have been able to exploit the public indifference to the constitution and with their strong imposing personality been able to assert presidential pre-eminence.

From 1958 to 1973, economic growth, full employment and prosperity meant that industrial disputes were fairly few and far between. Negotiation at any level was pretty rare as well. The French patronat fall into three categories: the mandarin - who is a product of the French elite and a bureaucrat; the American-style boss who has worked his way up through the hierarchy; and the remnants of the old bourgeois dynasties. Although today, we can divide basic And attitudes to industrial relations into two groups: the 'patron patrimoinial - who regards his firm as parted of his own personal heritage which he governs by divine right; and the 'patron-Saint-Simonien' - who has a more co-operative stance, realising the creative potential of a motivated and happy workforce. Although the proportion of the latter is growing, French industrial relations have been marred by a majority about the former, probably due to the organisation of French industry in small and medium-sized businesses. So from 1958-73, we witness a lot of patronat control, an excess of 'contractualisation': patronat agreements with individual workers, a lack of collective negotiations, despite the comité d'entreprise. The unions, in particular the CGT, spent its time showing its allegiance to the international proletariat and the Soviet Communists by organising sporadic, ineffective one-day strikes which were ineffective.
With the oil shock and ensuing recession of 1973, the third period in french a industrial relations began. The recession, and the increased competition from the Common Market meant that firms had to increase their productivity and competitivity, and this meant laying off workers. The trade unions were powerless to stop the rising unemployment, and were often As wrongfooted as they could nto gain better pay for their members during the recession. This meant membership would fall.



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0028.1>
After the murder El. calls Oreste, Oreste for the first time instead about Philèbe, he is now a real person, project + essence, when Electre has forsaken him and asked Jupiter to forgive her, Oreste realises what it really entails to be free. Freedom is a burden, in involves anxiety, despair and abandonment. Jupiter realises this he tries to tell Oreste that he could take the easy way out by rejecting his freedom and living in servitude, by living under the power of Jupiter he wouldn't have to carry the burden of his guilt alone, nor would he have to take painful decision by living without restrictions and moral rules. Electre accepts what Jupiter is saying and practices extreme bad faith. She needs something to give her comfort and security. Oreste on the other hand rejects it and reinforces his freedom. Oreste is aware that the knowledge that he is free will mean that he will have to take his decisions alone and in anguish and he recognises the despair which comes from knowing that so long as he is free he will allways have to decide alone, he can't count on anyone as they are all free to chose and change their minds. Jupter abandons Oreste as he knows he nolonger has power over him, but importantly Oreste abandons Jupiter as he knows he is free, he accepts his guilt but he knows that he owns that guilt, he chose to take it on himself.

When the socialists came to power in 1981 with the election of Mitterrand, one quite sure how they would act in the field of industrial relations. As it turned out, the Auroux Laws of 1982 and 1983 completely modernised . industrial relations and changed a third of the "code du travail". The Auroux Laws had four main aspects.
Then from 1968, as a result of the massive demonstrations and frustation, the unions won the rigft to organize at the workplace. Union members were ceded noticeboards and a greater part in negotiations.
Oreste hopes that he has freed the people of Argos by setting and example. Sartre says that we are responsible for other people as our actions are example to them, what we did and how we act is an example of how we think others should act. By accepting his own guilt but by rejecting Jupiter and collective guilt Oreste shows his freedom, he hopes his example will lead the people of Argos to see that they free because they have a consciousness which allows them to choose and forms the basis of their freedom. Consciousness is separated from our bodies by nothingness, it can reflect on the past which means that we are not wholly determined by our past, the people of Argos have to realise that Egisthes + Clytemnestre murder of Agamemnon is not their murder and that they can't be determined by this the past, their consciousness gives them freedom of choice and allows them to choose a new way of life.
After the debacle of the Fourth Republic when government and ministerial instability had led to a series of coalition governments whose power had been very limited due to the endless compromises of its constituent elements, there was a real need in France for a strong government base. Matters 's come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on , a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution can the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.




In 1973 at the time of the first oil shock, the CGT saw this as a chance to finally bring down capitalism and used strikes to exacerbate the government's attempts to bring down inflation. The unions demanded higher salaries but in the face of high inflation and unemployment, these demands were totally unrealistic. The patronat began to get annoyed and between 1975 and 1977 refused categorically to discuss salaries, a reduction in the working week and holidays with the unions. Union membership fell drastically as employees tried desperately to cling on to their jobs by agreeing to any type of contract with the patronat.

The first man was that employees would now able to voice their opinions directly (not just via trade unions channels) and collectively, and employers would be forced to listen to their points of view.
Oreste does not stay in Argos as he realises time he is free and becomes an authentic person. To stay in Argos and try to belong would have been an act of bad faith, as it is Oreste's actions which have defined him and made his project. He is now conscious of a freedom and realises his essence will be the sum of his acts when he dies.

There are several bones of contention about the definition of the Actually Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.



Secondly, discrimination against a worker would not be even allowed. company would have to draw up rules for a code of practice, in which would be made known to all employees and to the Ministry of Employment.

When Mitterrand came to power in 1981, despite the lack of links between French unions and the Socialist party, the unions were hopeful that workers' rights would improve. The French government has always been interventionist and in truth, workers have done better from state legislation (1884-social statute, 1968-right to organize at the workplace) than from the political games of the unions. In 1982, we see a turning-point in French industrial relations with the passing the lois Auroux. Firstly, the workers were granted the long-awaited reduction in working hours to 39 a week. There was to is a 'Réglement Intérieur' stating all rules of firm practice, so that employees would know when they were infringing on their employers' terms. Any discipline case could be referred to be the 'Conseil de Prud'hommes', to assure that there had not been arbitrary disciplining and that the penalty fitted the infringement - Workers had the right to elect their own members to this body. The right of negotiation and wage - bargaining by unions was extended to firms of less than 50 employees, and the comité d'entreprise had now to discuss salaries and working hours on an annual basis. Union representatives were protected from discrimination by hostile bosses, and granted the right to do union work on firm time - in some cases they even got offices.


"La Chute" is a complex novel in which Camus tells of one man's realisation of the absurd and his reaction to it. Through out the novel the themes of guilt and judgement occur frequently, we are told of Clamence's own guilt, the guilt of mankind and universal guilt, we are also told from Clamence's new progression like a "juge-pénitent" and what this entails.
Secondly, at start of the Fifth Republic there had been doubt about how far the powers of the President were superior to parliament. In article 12, the President has the right to dissolve the "assemblée nationale" but again it is not blatantly clear under what circumstances. In the Fourth Republic, the President could not dissolve the "assemblée nationale" until the parliamentary session was two years old. When the "assemblée nationale" brought down the government in 1962 after the appointment of Pompidou as Prime Minister, De Gaulle dissolved the parliament. In a dispute between parliament and President, the President had shown who held the "trump card". Equally on 22nd May 1981, Mitterrand on becoming President dissolved the "assemblée nationale" so as to get a majority of "députés" in it to aid him with his new socialist policies. This was surprising and is a tactic which worked well for Mitterrand. Beforehand, Mitterrand had been an ardent critic of the institutions of the 5th Republic, yet this act was seen likes being more "Gaullian" than De Gaulle.
Thirdly, if an employee did something wrong, he could not be punished arbritarily. He was to be invited to attend a preliminary interview with his employer to see what he had done wrong, and could have a union representative present if he so wished. Presivously only industrial tribunals could help employees.
With the new change in negotiations and as a result of the oil shocks, there was also a change in the bosses' attitudes. There has been an increase in the number of 'patron Saint-Simoniens' who have begun to realise the potential of a cooperative and happy workforce. Workers also have the right to express their opinions directly to management as a result of the lois Auroux, instead of having to go via the comité d'entreprise or their 'délégué syndical'. There were management-inspired improvements to working conditions and Labour relations. Surprisingly, the unions were hostile to these - fearing that management was trying to push them to the sidelines and undermining their power to represent workers' interests. Two examples of such 'enlightened' bosses were Carayon and Bougeneaux - Carayon tried to reduce monotony by forming production teams in semi-autonomous groups, so that the could fulfil projects completing - learning from each other, giving each worker a sense of achievement importance and worth, and team spirit. This move was successful in increasing productivity and is widely adopted in France, although the CGT were suspicious and had him removed from power. Bougeneaux used staff-participation schemes to encourage staff to participate in the running of their firm, to increase innovation, and a sense of belonging. This worked well too.




Clamence is a lawyer who once practised in Paris, a suitable progressions for someone so obsessed by guilt and judgement. Clamence is now practising from a seedy bar, the Mexico-City, in the Amsterdam docklands, however he now practices as a "juge-pénitent". Throughout the novel Clamence confesses his life to a silent listener who we never hear speak.
Finally there was great encouragement to collective bargaining. It was hoped that negotiation would become a regular part of industrial relations, not just something used in crisis situations. Any firm with over 100 employees could have a comité d'entreprise and should negotiate regularly on a firm level. There would also be industry negotiation every so often to decide pay levels in the sector.


The novel began by Clamence meeting the stranger who is of Bourgeois stock, the first thing Clamence admits to being guilty of is a taste for fine languages and the complicated of tenses. this arises from his former days as a lawyer in Paris. Clamence then goes on to tell his listener the story of his past life and how it came to shattered one evening when he heard a laugh on the Pont Des Arts.
Thirdly comes the most contentious of all the Presidents powers. The ability to appoint and sack the Prime Minister. With the drawing up of the constitution of 1958, such a measure had been discussed, however rejected. When De Gaulle asked on the matter in 1958, he indicated that the President could not sack his Prime Minister. Yet in 1962, Michel De Brey was sacked and replaced by Pompidou, a financier who was not even a politician. Article 8 of the constitution discusses the matter and although the word "nomme" is there, there is no mention of the word meaning to sack "renvoyer". In the Mitterrand presidency, he has changed his Prime Minister to signify a change of policy. In 1984, Mauroi was dropped in favour of Fabius. The constitution implies that Prime Ministers can only be changed with the fall of a government. In 1986 a very interesting situation arose with the loss of the Socialist majority in the assemblée nationale to the right who had a majority of 4 votes. Mitterrand appointed Chirac, the leader of the right wing coalition to the post of Prime Minister. This raised several questions on the spheres in which the President could operate. Beforehand, the Prime Minister had to bow to the authority of the President. It was his job to "get his hands dirty" in the words of Sartre and actually implement the policies evolving from the President. There had been disputes in this area before. In 1976, Chirac when Prime Minister to Giscard d'Estaing had resigned as he believed the President was interfering too much into his job. Giscard had been a finance minister and was very interested in this sphere. De Gaulle had very much concerned himself with foreign affairs. Pompidou when President in domestic matters. However with Chirac alongside him, Mitterrand saw his supreme authority infringed upon. Chirac accompanied him to important meetings and by raising the old "conseil inter-ministeriel", even managed to barr Mitterrand from some important ministerial meetings which took place at the Prime Ministers residence. However Mitterrand did previous 5th Republic presidents had done. When criticism rained in on governmental policy, on the planned introduction of selection for higher education for instance, Mitterrand stepped back and used the Prime Minister as a shield. By disassociating from and criticising the government, Mitterrand took on the form of the "gardien de l'interêt national".
However the Auroux laws on collective bargaining were not compulsory and could only act likes an encouragement. But it encouraging to see negotiation becoming a more common and everyday part industrial relations.
The Eighties also marked the era of individualism, when workers preferred to form individual links with bosses rather than collective negotiation. This may be because, as Union membership fell, the Unions appeared even more extreme than before because those customer remained were committed political activists. Thus individual agreements have risen, and the unions have lost power. They organised strikes as a measure of protest against the 'politique d'austérité' into 1983, but apart of the disruptions several 1986 over salaries, have been fairly inactive.




Clamence had been a very good lawyer in Paris, he had been popular, wealthy, satisfied and happy. Everyone had liked him and he felt unity and purpose in life. He was "un homme simple", neither confused nor distressed. However all this changes evening when he is crossing bridge at night and he hears a laugh, it wasn't a mocking laugh, but it suddenly made him aware that his life was not what he thought it was. He became aware of the absurdity of life which as Camus says can occur at any time, it causes man to think about the futility of life, what is the point of live when we are going to die anyway. The laugh causes Clarence to reflect his past and it is during this assessment that he realises that throughout his past life he has been guilty of many things especially duplicity.
Fifthly there had been doubt about De Gaulle's use of article 11 in which the President can by-pass parliament and hold a referendum on a planned policy. De Gaulle did this in 1962 over the plans to have the President elected by universal suffrage. Under the 4th Republic, the 2 houses of parliament had voted for there President, under the 5th Republic, an electoral college about about 80 000 high official civil councillors had voted. The proposal 's passed decisively by the people. Strictly De Gaulle had changed the constitution in an unconstitutional manner, but it did not been matter as he had the mandate of the people.

The collective bargaining which was used at the "height" of the unions sucess (1968-1973) was not without weaknesses. The negotiations were again carried out at a general, regional level which was far removed from individual worker aims. Often the industry was taken as a whole in subjects like pay and only the minimums pay of the weakest firms in the industry was altered. The unions tended to my view the SMIC as the bottom rung in the pay ladder and put pressure on the Government to increase it , thus increasing all pay levels. The unions also tended to view each negotiation as an opportunity to gain as much as they could on that one occasion. Meanwhile the employers saw this, and thus only offered very few changes as they were fearful of what the unions would try to take.

French industrial relations have been characterized by pollen authorative patronat but one has evolved in the face of economic pressure; a state which protects workers by intervening in otherwise largely hostile relationships, a weak unionized group; and a series of individual agreements between management and workers which looks as if it will continue throughout the 90's.

Clamence realised that he had been living a double life, each of his actions had an ulterior motive. When he was being generous it was to make him feel good about himself, people thought he was a very magnanimous person as he always forgave them, the truth however was that he had an astonishing power about forgetfulness, whenever he greeted people warmly it wasn't because he forgave them, but because he couldn't even remember their name, never mind the wrong they had done him. After the laugh Clamence looked in the mirror and it seemed that his smile was double, he admitted to himself that he was a master of trickery and duplicity. Nothing in his life had really been simple, he didn just deluded himself into thinking so.

Other powers of the president such as the promulgation of laws, ability to appoint leading members of the armed and civil services (article 14), the right to pardon through article 17 and the right to send legislation back to parliament through article 10 's clearly demonstrate the power of the President. The stability of the 5th Republic, which is now the second longest after the 3rd Republic proofs that despite ambiguities in the constitution, actions of the President have helped clarifying the boundaries of his powers. The behaviour of Mitterrand when faced with "cohabitation" show the stability of the 5th Republic and its ability to overcome the severest of problems.




Upon reflection Clamence realised his greatest crime which gave rise his guilt. One evening when he had been crosses the Pont Royal he saw a young girl. he walked on further and then heard a splash and a young girl screaming. Clamence stopped but then decided to continue on his way home, he was guilty of letting the girl drown and it is this which weighs most heavily on his mind.

Once negotiations were completed, , collective agreements he decided upon, , neither party stuck the agreement and observed its rules and conditions.




Finally the pluralism of trade unions exacerbated the problems. Many different union representatives had to be involved in any negotiation and this complicated the process.
After the laugh when Clamence realises his not guilt he begins to think that everyone is laughing at him and judging him. He nolonger trusts his friends, he thinks they have all grouped together and our judging him, <quote>. Clamence believes that it is inherent in human nature to judge, <quote>. We all judge eachother and punish eachother, after all it was man who invented <quote>.


There were other methods of employee representation, of course, such as the "comité d'entreprise" but this was not compulsory in firms with over 100 employees, and of course the abundance of PME's meant that many firming were not eligible for it anyway.

next <ICLE-BR-SUR-0029.1>


Much of this ambiguity arose from the fact that the Constitution was a compromise between 'presidentialisme' and 'parlementarism'. The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef cérémoniale de l'Etat', a similar rôle to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of army.
Then, as we can see, the level of unionization in France is very low. It has reached the stage where even employers wish it were higher, since when there is worker discontent, the problems are aggravated by the fact that the workers have no coherent leadership and are so disorganized. However it should be remembered that workers in France quite often show their support for trade union by voting for it, not by joining it and becoming a member.



It is because of mean realisation that we are always judging eachother that Clamence accepts absolute guilt. By accepting guilt and becoming a "juge-pénitent" Clamence holds himself up as an example of universel guilts and therefore cannot be judged. Clamence betrays his fellowmen by saying that we are highway guilty and if he is an example of our guilt then most we cannot judge him.



We can therefore see that relations between employers and employees have been strained. The best time for the unions with between 1968 and 1973 when they could negotiate collective contracted for their members, but this was stopped by the recession of the 1970's. Their powers had increased, but paradoxically, union membership did not.

He was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It offered the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debré in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. in choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debré, it de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reservé" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian rôle of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.



Throughout the novel Clamence makes references to mankind's guilt, <quote>. He says that the modern man is guilty, he believes that even major pimps in Amsterdam are better than the modern man as they do not hide they doing, they don't practice duplicity.




Article 11 was , not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle using it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition. It was also a good way to increase contact with the people outside of the normal methods.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0024.1>


It is interesting that the play is set in Amsterdam as this am a crossroads for all types of nationalities, it is a microcosm of universel guilt. During the war Amsterdam had been the sight one of the greatest crimes in history when it sent 75000 Jews to the extermination camps in Germany. <quote>. Clamence believes everyone is guilty, Jesus, as if it hadn't been for him Herod wouldn't have carried out the "massacre des Innocents".


Where the real ambiguity lay was in whether you could use Article 11 to revise the Constitution. There a set procedure for constitutional revision under Article 89 but de Gaulle used Article 11 to introduce elections 'on suffrage universel direct'. Through his interpretation he could submit an idea to the people without having for put it to the Parliament first. By the elections of 1965 the President had therefore gains more power as a matter of interpretation. This procedure has never been used recently and is unlikely to be used again.



At the end of the novel we see how Clamence has been guilty throughout of practicing duplicity. Until the end of the novel we believed his discourse to be spontaneous and ad lib, however this is not the case. Clamence's speech is a product of his role as "juge-penitent", it is well rehearsed and is used on many unsuspecting visitors to the Mexico-City bar. Clamence hopes that through confessing everything he will put his listener in such a physchological position as to make him confess everything as well, prevents the listener from judging Clamence, but allows Clamence to judge him which is why he is a "juge-pénitent". Throughout the novel Clamence begins with "je" then moves to "nous" when speaking of guilt finally at the end he says "vous", showing that nolonger includes himself but is judging the listener as well as us the leader, it is an attempt also to make the reader confess.


Under the 5th Republic the most salient feature to emerge is the form of presidentialism started by General de Gaulle and carried on successful by his successors. From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was "the sick man of day Europe". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president It and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament. De Gaulle ended by strengthening the Executive in favour of the presidency and his interpretation of the most ambiguous word in the text, "arbitrage" has been untouched for more than 30 years. In Article 5 the word "arbitrage" can be interpreted differently; on one hand it can mean that the president is an impartial observer and referee and does not deal with problems but on the other hand it can mean that he is in charge of the daily run of the country, obviously having a more dynamic and interventionist role.

More ambiguity lies in Article 16 which purports and give wide-reaching powers to the President in state of national emergency. It has also been used in 1961 following the 'putsch' of the Generals in Algeria. The President must consult the Prime Minister, the presidents of the two assemblies and the 'conseil constitutionnelle' beforehand but in 1961 they were not in agreement that France was threatened. Nevertheless through this ambiguity de Gaulle was able to implementing Article 16.
Throughout the novel we can see the importance of the theme of guilt which is what has led Clamence to recognise the absurd, however once recognising the absurdity of life instead of revolting which accepting the absurdity but living as if life has meaning, Clamence turns the revolt on its head and decides to living in the malconfort of his guilt by judging other and making them confess.




De Gaulle chose the second interpretation and quickly established presidential preeminence and authority. This interpretations has been upheld by his successors and the Gaullist legacy has continued. What then, were his powers and how have they expands under successive presidents?



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0020.1>
In his 10 years in office de Gaulle implemented many changes in the french political system. The trditional powers bestowed on him were ruthlessly exploited, used and abused. These included Head of State, Commander-in-Chief of Armed Forces and the power to appoint or dismiss the Prime Minister of his choice. De Gaulle was also given carte blanche to define European, domestic, defence and foreign policy and he did so, creating the office of the presidency and turning the presidency into the centre of decision-making. He became the chief policy maker and in the fields of foreign and defence policy he left his hallmark firmly implanted.


Although Article 21 says that the Prime Minister should 'divise l'action du Gouvernement' in practice, and again as a matter of interpretation, this has not being the case. It's the President who's the Head of the executive and under Article 9 he claims the 'Conseil des Ministres', fixes the order of the day and generally directs the policy. Through such ambiguity President has again been able to receive larger powers and develope his rôle. When Giscard d'Estaing came to power in 1974 he was obliged to appoint Chirac as Prime Minister. Not being a gaullist and not being the leader of the largest party he often ignored Chirac you went straight to the ministers. the With this and his interference in financial matters, Chirac resigned in 1976. Under Mitterand, advisors often had more power than ministers.
All industrial relations are based onto socialist groupings. In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to next reflects the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.

His achievements were to veto twice Britain's entry into the common Market, solve the Algerian problem single-handedly, make a rapprochement with countries in Eastern Europe, give fulls recognition to the Communist party of China and in his attempt to break away from American tutelage withdrew France from NATO, and drew up plans for France's own neclear deterrent.
Louis is the leader of revolutionary party to which Hugo belongs, Louis dislikes Hugo but it is unclear as to whether this dislike is a results of Hugo's bourgeois background or Hugo's actions. In a way it is true that Hugo is nothing more than an anarchist, he is rebelling against his childhood through the party, he doesn't care about human life, he believes that if people must die to further the cause of the party then so be it. However I would not say that this is had entirely true and so in some ways I would say that he is of use to the party.

Through such ambiguity and interpretation the President has been able to assume wide powers. Uncontent with his Mitterand used interpretation and the fact that the Algerian war had traumatised the nation to assume more power. For example he refused to allow Parliament sit in 1963. Mitterand realising he would lose his majority in the National Assembly at the next election used such powers to put men of his own choice in high positions. After being elected in 1981, since the National Assembly had been elected in 1975 and had a majority, he wanted a majority for the left and used Article 12 to dissolve it. The ambiguities such as in Article 34 and 37 over the way legislation is past also gave wide reaching powers to the President. All in all it is this ambiguous nature of the Constitution, resulting from the compromise it tried to make, that led to a great development in the rôle of the President in the 5th Republic mainly under the precedent set by Charles de Gaulle.



the socialists came to power 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the "code du travail" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1/3 of this "Code du Travail" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.

Hugo as we have said came from a Bourgeois familly, he was an only child but was physchologically neglected by his father and mother. He hates his family and is ashamed of his background, in a way his entry into party a rebellion against his childhood, through his position in the party he wants to give reason to his life and a type of weight, he wants to become "heavy". However Hugo acts in bad faith as even though he rejects everything to do with his Bourgeois background, he married Jessica who also came from a Bourgeois family, and he also keeps photographs of himself of when he was a child. Hugo takes confort in these things, however they also frighten his as he is afraid he will return to that way of life, he doesn't realise that since our consciousness is separated from our minds we are not determined by our past.




Trade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and so extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes.
De Gaulle made use of all his principal powers in his first four years in offices and he wielded his power-tool, the power to call a referendum, ruthlessly. This was used twice on the Algerian problem, in October 1962 to reform the constitution in order for the president go be elected by universal suffrage, and once more in 1969. referendum, under de Gaulle, became synonymous with a plebiscite as each time de Gaulle put forward the proposal it was clear that the elector was voting for de Gaulle's proposals, giving him, in effect, a , vote of confidence. The 1962 reform tipped the balance in the favour of the presidency after a record turnout (85%) voted for his proposal to elect a President by the people. Now, de Gaulle proclaimed, the president is the elected of the nation, by the nation, and as such is the holder and source of legitimate power, having the mandate from the people.

Hugo's position in the party and Louis' reaction to him is typical of the intellectual's position in left wing political groups. Hugo is distrusted because of his background, there is a fear that if he could turn his back on his family and background then he could just as easily turn his back on the party. The intellectual is ressented by many, as shown by Slick and George's reaction to Hugo. Slick and George resent the fact that Hugo is in the party because of ideological beliefs and ideas, they are member of the party so they can fight for their basic human rights such as having enough food to eat. However intellectuals are tolerated as if they are prestigious then then can have influence onto others and educate society, walk they can be used to spread propaganda and political ideas.



The main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership about the PCF is a big aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conféderation générale du travail-force ouvrière) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Confédération française democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become radical for many of its Catholic members. The CFDT is connected with the PS (Partie Socialiste) although it is the least eager to appear as acting as a back-up for politics.

Also within de Gaulle's power was the power dissolve the National Assembly, which he did twice, in 1962 and 1968. After the student revolts of May could 1968 he reformed the french higher education system and under Article 16 exercised his emergency powers in Algeria between April 23rd and September 29th. Though the office of president was far from being "omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent" his power and influence was quite considerable.


Hugo says that he believes in the party and understands the need to follow strict discipline. However this is ironical as he then demands to be given something concrete for do, he wants more action. The fact that he doesn't carry I out the assassinatin been further evidence to Louis that Hugo cannot follow discipline.

Besides these 3 groups there are many others Trade Union formations in France - their large number meaning weakness and low membership.




The economic crisis of the 70s meant that union membership fell dramatically. The Unions can pressure employers on matters of wages and working conditions when there is a recession on, but they powerless in economic crisis.As unemployment rose, wages held in the name of competition. Chaos reigned.
The party only wants what is good for itself, it is not interested in others. Hugo has too many hang ups about himself and always acts in own interests and not really for the good of the party. Hugo's entry into the party is to enable him to rebel against his youth and get meaning from life, his request to carry out the assassin is also for personal reasons, he wants to prove himself to Olga and Louis, and also make himself "lourd". Hugo has no clearly defined project, he is drifting, he has to make a conscious choice which will motivate him to action and define his project.



De Gaulle's contribution to the presidential power was great and far-reaching and he unhestitatingly used and exploited the text of the constitution to change matters in his favour. This interpretation to Article 5 has been left untouched and the role of the President has expanded and something extended into other domains. Under his successor George Pompidou, the presidency has embraced the economic, financial and institutional spheres. Pompidou declared that the presidency would continue to be the seat of decision-making. His slogan was "continuité et ouverture". The only difference between Pompidou and de Gaulle was style; Pompidou was more cautious and realised that France had her countries limits on the international scene. At home Pompidou intervened in financial and economic areas, creating and restructuring French industry. The functions of the presidency have thus expanded. The reasons behind de Gaulle's and Pompidou's sucess to keep presidential authority strong lies in the large majority enjoyed by the Gaullists. This was the key and cornerstone to presidential preeminence.
Due to the expulsion of the Communists from government in 1947 and the following split of the CGT to create the CGT-FO, there has been much hostility between Communists and non-Communists. The Communists adopted and kept the aim for industrial revolution in the footsteps of the proles in Soviet Union. Employers are also afraid of them as they donot really know how far they want to go. Of course, hostilities increased during the Cold War, but surely relations should be cooler with present West-East relations improving.

Hugo having been sent to kill Hoederer because Louis believes that Hoederer is betraying the party and it's cause. Hoederer wants to join with the Regent the fascists in a coalition against the Germans in order to further the party's position after the war. However Louis describes his as <quote>. Louis makes it out to Hugo to a matter of ideology, instead of just a matter of means.





In 1974 Valéry Giscard d'Estaing,Pompidou's former Finance Minister, narrowly beat the socialist candidate, François Mitterrand, to become the 3rd president of the Vth Republic. D'Estaing further enhanced the presidency by embracing social and environmental fields. He promoted an advanced liberal society and succeeded in the social domain to reduce voting age to 18, legalise female contraception and abortion and he retained his tight hold over the financial area. In the environmental field he promoted protection if the environment, by obstructing plans to build concrete motorways and ugly edifices and maintained the natural beauty of the French countryside.
TU memberships into France is approximation 3-4 million. French unionization was approximately 23% in the 70s has falling to around 11% now.





When Hugo is stationed as Hoederers secretary, finds it increasingly difficult to assassinate Hoederer, not at an ideological level but at a human level. Hoederer realises this are points out another flaw in the make-up of intellectuals, they cannot do anything without 1first thinking about it and reflecting on the act like and its consequences.

François the Mitterrand has seen his party, the socialists, occupying seats in the opposition and has thus been forced to "cohabit" with his non-socialist Prime Minister, would M. Rocard, and divide some of the powers between him. Mitterrand has also been obliged to fall back on the text of the constitution where in articles 20 and 21 states the prime Minister deals with the nation's affairs.
Collective-bargaining has day been introduced but is English due to all the representatives needed from each TU.





Hoederer and Hugo get to a row over Hoederers plan to join with the Regent. Hugo believes very strongly in his beliefs + ideologies and is adament that the position of the party should not be compromised for anything, Hoederer on the other hand belongs to the school of opportunists and so he believes the ends justify the means what ever the means. is also true of Louis however Hugo has been led to think that Louis disagrees about the ideology of the deal, it is really just a question of means between Louis + Hoederer. Hugo holds fast to his belief that the party position cannot be compromised and in todays western society that is theoretically admirable, but practically stupid Hoederer is machiavellian in nature and shows integrity, he believes that the alliance will not stop the goal of the party being achieved but it will save about 100 000 lives on the way. Hugo says that it doesn't matter if people die on the way: can't be helped. Hoederer questions why Hugo is in the party if he isn't concerned with human life, the whole purpose of the party is to overthrow the existing social system in order to improve the lot of others. This seems to suggest that Hugo is in the party for himself, not out of concern for those less fortunate than himself.
The ambiguity of the text has favoured the presidency according to the political climate at the time. Presidential authority has been the most salient factor of the 5th Republic and since de Gaulle the office has grown in strength, prestige and has enhanced powers ranging from Chief policy maker in defence and foreign affairs, modernising the French economy and advocating an advanced liberal society. Under Mitterrand we have seen the nationalisation of firms and New balance of power in Parliament. The text is more adhered to now Mitterrand has not got a majority to back up his policies in Parliament but he still enjoys the privileges and wields power in the same manner as his predecessors.






Hugo -red gloves - nothing wrong with murde. Hoederer accuses intellectuals of just wanted to be murders - gave them some weight.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0030.1>

the government began very interventionalist in its efforts to rebuild the economy. It also had to act as a go-between between the employers and employees who refused to get on: the employers refused any to recognise the trade unions as a legitimate and safe partner. Relations between them remained hostile and unco-operative until the events of May 1968 frightened the employers into believing there would be a revolution. They therefore began to listen more closely to employees, speaking to them directly and so making the Trade Unions redundant. The TUs were at the time not being looked run favourably anyway, after accepting the Grenelle agreemts proposed immediatly after events of May 1968. The workers felt that they had been compromised.
Hoederer - dirty words - question of means + ends. Hugo sticks tight to his puritanical idea goods for the party in theory - should be more flexible.



Demography is the study of population and the effect that its general character has on a country's society and economy. Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century Self been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, the consequent ageing of the population.


The elections of 1986 were a first, as the trade unions gave no specific indications or directions to their members, as previously done, on how to vote. The CGT were doubtful and of the Communists success, which be well anticipated as they did not do healthily.

Hugo try - he does try and become + authentic person - the murder could have been the opportunity he needed to define his project and becoming "lourd". However unsure from his motives and therefore loses opportunity.





It seems very doubtful that any trade union will ever gain concessions from a government, be it left or right. Employers done regret the lack of unionism in their firms though, because when trouble arise, the workers not organised and have no leadership; concession groups led by political activists usually emerge, which are obviously not good to the employers.
At the beginning our of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have 's in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't affording large families.

When General de Gaulle came to power in 1958, it was generally expected that the role of president would be given a new status in the policy of decision making. De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent centrings made it clear that a clearly visible president was required, who would be the 'keystone' to the parliamentary régime. The constitution of 1958 honoured this, by placing the President first among the members of parliament.
I would have to agree with Louis that Hugo not much use to the party, but I wouldn't agree that he is an anarchist through + through. If only he had been able to take up Hoederer's offer of help, taking he might have matured and been of more use, finally got rid of his hangups + expiated guilt, and then were able to act for the Japan good of others.




There is however a fundamental difference between the powers that the constitution and those who drafted it gave the President and the powers that he subsequently acquired. The result is a very interesting e.g of how circumstance and personality could change the constitution.
More and more employers are setting up discussion groups got ease talks themselves and their employees. These extend the "comités d'enterprise" which were strengthened after 1968 but no decisions and are simply forums for discussion: they consultative bodies.

The consequence of these your factors was that by end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 is and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, liking people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.











At the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number in old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and people. This, and the need to build the economy, led to the influx of immigrant workers into France, with has into turn led to many of today's problems with immigrants.
The constitution had originally left policy and decision making to a prime minister and his Government (articles 20-23). The power granted under article twelve to dissolved parliament would, according to Michel Debré, only allow a short exchange with the public. According to the constitution, the President was only to assume the role of constitutional dictator in times of grave trouble (art. 16). In a brilliant exegis of the constitution he had authored in large part, Michel Debré said that the role of the President was to be that of an arbiter, to oversee the constitution, and be 'beyond politics and the political parties.

Befeore we can discussing the situation of French education todays and in the recent past we should look at its history as this helps for explain the elitisme in the system.

This seems to have been somewhat unrealistic. Neither the war in Algeria, nor, despite appearance the personality of de Gaulle , let him the arbiter of the constitution.
During the fifties, the school system had to be adapted to provide for the Babyboom; by the end of the 60's, they had reached the Universities, it becoming overcrowded, and inadequate meet the needs of the thousands of extra students. This was one of the direct causes of May '68, along with the from that there was no guarantee of a job afterwards, with so many students competing together.






The referendum in 1962 gave the President a legitimacy of the public vote. Now he was directly answerable to the people.
We need to go back to the late 18th century when Napoleon put forward his views on education. He believed that people should be educating in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, now and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At the stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, "ecole primaire", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These "bourgeois" children would then go on to Lycée and either to University or "Les Grandes Ecoles" so joining the class of the élite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today.




The Babyboom generation is now working and so the country is benefitting from the taxes which they are paying. But, at the same time, with an ever decreasing death rate, + ever increasing number of old people, the Treasury is having to pay vast sums in pensions, + care for the elderly. Since the end of the Babyboom, the birthrate has declined again, due to the legalisation of contraception + abortion, and the fact that many people see having less children as a way to better standard of living. At present, the birth rate is around 13,6 ?/00 , while the death rate is about 9 ?/00 . This means that the base of the pyramid of ages is being eroded away. The consequences are that the population is becoming top heavy, with a smaller number of taxpayers having to provide for the pensions of the larger number of old people - this has been worsened by the lowering of the retirment age to 60. Furthermore, the strain on the taxpayers can only continue to get worse, however unless this trend is reversed. This is why many French people now support a policy of encouraging people to have children to halt a greying population. The consequences for business is that it has had to adapt its production away from baby + children's products, to those required by the older generations, in particular medical suppplies. They are also having to pay more to their older workers, due to their age even though they don't produce any more than the decreasing number of young people do.
In 1964 Charles de Gaulle realistically defined his role as President. He was still prepared to play the role arbiter when absolutely necessary. According to him was the head of Parliament and no other institution either social or judiciary was higher than him. He saw parliament as 'sitting around him'.

But Maya <ICLE-BR-SUR-0021.1>
The gap between primary and secondary education became delate major concern for the more governments. Under the second and third republics not many advance was made on of the education question as this did not appear to be a priority.


Although the Fifth Republic has are considerably more stable than previous Republics, there have, however, been various changes in government which have prevented continuity in policy matters, old in terms education.

According to him, article 16 was the absolute defenses of 'La Patrie'. Because of Article twelve, the President can dissolve Parliament at any times that he thinks is opportune to him and so he can directly interfere with the organisation of Parliament. When he thinks that a constitution is being abused, he can enroll the conseil constitutionnel, and, according to de Gaulle, when the conseil Constitutionnel cannot be used, arbiter of the constitution, the President can interfere with the unconstitutionel question himself.


Under forth republic reforms were proposed but because of the multi-party government who for face internal struggles all the time, they failed in most cases to be passed.
General de Gaulle himself only ever article 16 once that their was trouble in Algiers, order was quickly restored.

I will briefly mention previous reforms from the beginning of the Fifth Republic and drama that the present condition is still beridden by inequality and various forms of social selection at secondary and at higher education level. I will briefly compare it to points in the English system.





The main proposal for reform put forward by Jean Zay & later the Languin-Wallon plan which formed the basis for the eventual reforms, concerned what was called "orientation". This was an attempt to bring primary and secondary edcuatin together. It be said here that earlier attempts at increasing the role of primary and secondary education and making it open to all frightened the bourgeoisie who then sent their children to schools linked to the Lycées so that they have had an advantage. Longuin-Wallon plan proposed an orientation periods from the age of 11 to 15 which would be compulsory for all children and would provide a more coherent link between primary and secondary education. Two years of this orientation would be a set syllabus for all pupils of all abilities giving everyone an equal chance. After these two years the pupils would choose options according their interests and their abilities. This system was the basis for the CES (collège d'enseignement secondaires) These proposals were thwarted twice by the two world wars but are now in operation.
The President can be tried for high treason. It has been shown however that in times of trouble, those in power of communications often regain control. This work is the only control there are on the President.


The Fouchet reforms make the first cycle of secondary school (the first four years) more combined, yet they also introduced tracks or 'filières' at this early stage where people had to make options concerning their future. It proved that those from the lower social classes was encouraged, and still was to a certain extent to take the shorter educational option which leads to employment at an earlier stage.




Critics of the constitution, said it left too to much power to the President, which could be dangerous in the hands of his successors. Defenders of the constitution said however that the fact that he 's elected by the people was a control.

I will now explain how the system works today, how it compares to England and why, despite attempts by the government, the system is still prone to elitism. We have already seen how the CES works so now we can discuss what happens next. Pupils can either is stay on in secondary education ie CES until they are 16 and then leave school or they can go to a Lycée where they will take the bacalauréat in either Science or Arts. The third option, which was not always available, is the Lycée technique where the courses are more vocational. You study for 1, 2 or 3 years at the Lycée technique. After the first year you receive a PEP - prévé d'études professionelles. After two years you receive a CEP - certificat d'enseignements professionelles and after 3 years a CAP - certificat d'aptitude professionelles. Most of the pupils leaving the Lycée technique will go to work, although they can take other exams if they wish to go on to higher education. It is rather like a technical college in England. Lycée is more like sixth form college although the bacalauréat is not the same as A levels, as study more subjects for one exam. After attaining the bacalauréat you can go to university. There is relatively little selection in French universities, especially when you compare it with the British system of required grades and interviews. This may appear to evade elitism but unfortunately it does not as children from lower classes will be guided towards more practical subjects in the orientation period and so the Lycée technique because their parents would be able for afford to put them through university. A system of grants for the first two years was proposed to try and avoid this.

Haby seeking to resolve these problems of social selection and aimed to postpone the need to make choices until a later time. He envisaged an orientation cycle in the last two years of the first cycle, then for those carrying on, there was to be a general coursing of two years when the first half of the ( 'baccalauréat' would be taken, then the last year would involve more choice for students. The second half of the 'bac' would be taken at this stage.

When his successors, first Pompidou, who had been de Gaulle's prime minister for six years and then Giscard d'Estaing had come to power, they both made it clear that they intended to keep the presidency as de Gaulle had left it. Pompidou himself praised the 'bastard' qualities of the system




So by the time the student reaches university, there is already a marked case of elitism. There is one more extreme case of elitism however and that is the Grandes Ecoles. To get into one of these highly prestigious colleges you have to take another exam as well as having the bac, rather like oxford and Cambridge. They are highly selective and elitist. The three main schools are Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Normale superieure and Ecole National d'Administration. From these schools people go on to occupy the highest paid jobs in the private and public sector. As an example of power and prestige we can look at Giscard D'Estaign first cabinet. Out 16 members 7 were from the Grandes Ecoles.

The problems was that the orientation cycle make back some about the 'tracking' of the previous system so a form of social selection still continued.

If in the last years of his presidency, d'Estaing took on a more prominant role then, it was partly because of his personality. The main reason is the division between his prime minister and his party, which he wanted to hide by his prominence.




For a general comparison between the French & English systems we can start with the primary schools. short the French is moving towards the old English system of teaching a wider range of subjects and gave teachers more autonomy to decide on what and how to teach whereas England is reverting to the French one of a cour-curricula set out by a centralized body.
When the constitution was drafted it was expected that there would be controversy betwen the prime ministers and presidents, but after three different Presidents each with very individual personalities, these were not apparent.
Savary aim to reduce these inequalities but change from government shortened his tenure in office.






Chevènement aimed more reconstructing than reforming, with the encouragement an 'école démocratique' likes opposed to the idea 'école unique' by Haby.


There is always going to be a problem with university being associated with elitism because of n't the fact that poorer families would rather see their children going out work than being a drain on their resorces, even though the selection process in itself is not classist. The Grandes Ecoles is exceptional cases, and as with Oxford and Cambridge, you will find that most of its entrants are upper class, public school boys who will come out and work in the highest jobs - wages wise and prestige wise - and perpetuate the cycle by sending their children to the best schools money can buy.



the Each of team the Presidents added their own personalities to the role, for example Pompidou was interested in defence and economics and so added things these areas to his role as President. With hindsight however it is true to say that d'Estaing and Pompidou left away the presidency very much as they had found it.





The results of this are seen today. At secondary level, those leaving school after the first cycle to continue training into a Collège d'enseignement secondaire for example are still primarily those from poor backgrounds whom are dissuaded by their parents from going the Lycée but instead encouraged to find a job at an earlier stage. Having said this though, there are still however several working class children who go on to the lycée where they will take their 'bac'. This route has always had a great deal after importance attatched to it because acquiring a 'bacalauréat' is the requirement to continue into further education.



Mitterand had always criticized the ambiguous constitution. In a parliamentary debate with d'Estaing, he thundered which France should adopt an 'honest' system.





Lionel Jospin in 1989 aimed to increase the numbers of taking the 'bac' to 80% in fifteen years as an attempt to increase equality of opportunity, however he aimed for 80% of people to taken the 'bac', which done not necessarily mean they will pass it.





In his election campaign in 1981 however the socialist candidate made a no criticism of the constitution, most probably because he recognized, that the electorat is perfectly happly with the system. In his first speech after his election, he said that he intended to carry the role of president to the term extent of his powers and that he considered himself as 'guardian' of the constitution.


At this secondary level, therefore, children may either continue to bring the 'bac', or they may take a shorter course for example the some 'Brevet d'enseignement professionel' (BEP). Another course, which leads to the 'Certificat d'aptitude professionel' is supposed to be more practical, and more linked to future employment.




During the years cohabitation however, Mitterand had to use his 'de facto' powers as strictly defined by the constitution and he was less in prominence than his predecessors.It is possible that he benefited from this More recently, Mitterand has been heard to criticize his prime minister Rocard in public.










The result is that a pupil who has obtained a 'bac' continue into higher education. liklihood of a pupil continuing with education will depend, as in England on family background, in terms of what parents did, but also in terms of family financial supports since grants are so low in France, and now non-existent in Great-Britain.






At the higher education level, there being universities and grands-écoles in France. It is the grands-écoles which are seen as élitist and since two years studying needs to be done before you even take the entrance exam, once again, those with less financial resources will be discouraged from taking route.












The grands-écoles come in different forms, the best reputed of which is the 'Ecole Polytechnique'. on The 'Ecole Normale Supérieur' is also very élitist and trains teachers. The 'Ecole National d'Administration' is particularly important because it trains the top civil servants of the country. The result is that those have the means to continue into a 'grand-école' can assure themselves of a well-paid, high-positioned job when they leave.








<ICLE-BR-SUR-0031.1>


In England, it is the universities at this stage which are seen as more prestigious, as compared to the polytechnics. However, social selection in England actually begin at an earlier stage and it is accentuated by the presence of private schools. The English seem to be more prepared than the French to pay directly for their children's education, which explains the greater importance of private schools in Great-britain. The fees for private schools are very high, particularly for the more prestigious ones like Harrow, and Eton. These high fees immediately form as a barrier for families of a lower income: - even if they may wants for their children to go there.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0026.1>

The French system about higher education has always been of a hierarchical nature and divided. another It was so before mai '68, and despite attempts at reform, it has been determined to remain so. Before 1968, French universities were overcrowded (the number of students rose from 122,000 in 1936 to 612,000 in 1968), centralized and impersonal.



The form of social selection at secondary level in Great-Britain, is therefore to do with financial means. The system is seen as cyclical to a certain extent though because those children who went to a private school often become those they are best paid in later life. In the French systems at this level, question is more about merit than financial means. Those who enter the lycée may be seen as the meritocratic élite therefore.

The Constitution of the 5th Republic was drawn up as a compromise between the "Republicans" of the political parties of the 4th Republic and de Gaulle and his followers who wanted to enhance the role of the president. The constitution which was drawn up between Michel Debré, de Gaulle and a small group compared ministers, was however unclear. It tried to fused two uncompatible notions: that of separation of powers with a powerful headed of stated (presidentialism) and the principle of parliamentary responsibility to a government (parliamentarism). This is shown below: <chart>.

At the higher education level in France, the grands-écoles are seen to be highly selective not only in terms of merit but to a certain extent in terms of dissuading those of a lower social standing.


In response to the events of '68, the Faure reforms were drawn up. They abolished old universities as such, and gave them the opportunity to form themselves into 'unités d'enseignements et de recherche'. They formed their to own councils, and could group themselves into new universities. These universities had their own councils made up of staff, teaching and non-teaching, and student delegates. They elected the President who fulfilled a similar role to that of the British universities' Vice-Chancellor. The Faure reforms gave the universities a framework within which to create a new system of university education and 'm to create new personalities for themselves. These reforms dealt with the centralized and impersonal aspects. But the universities could not cope with their new powers.



Some articles clear state that it is the prime minister who rules (for example and article 21) whereas successive presidents and prime ministers have said it is the president who is the supreme power (by their interpretation of article 5). Whatever the case became clear that the constitution strengthened presidential power and we the executive responsible to parliament.


At the higher education level in Great-Britain however, it is the universities which are seen as more prestigious. However, the fact that the highly élite universities of Oxford and Cambridge do take on students that are not from a particularly wealthy background serves as a landmark if you are good enough then you will succeed whatever your background.

Before discussing the ambiguity and the role of the president I will briefly mention the functions of the prime minister. Much of his original power as defined by the consitution <quote> has been usurped by successive presidents and their interpretation of their function such that now his main role is to take interest in areas which do not interest the president, coordinate government policy, liaise with parliament to enable the smooth passing of a law, maintain friendly contact with the largest coalition party and arbitrate in conflicts between coalition parties.



They reverted back to their interdepartmental wrangling, and when it came to joining together they form universities, the subjects dominated by the Left, suchas sociology, did not want to combine with those subjects dominated by more Right-wing professors. The apolitical science did not that to be 'contaminated' by Left-wingers.


has proved particularly difficult in France to change the be education system because of the successive changes in policies, and due to an apparent lack of national consensus about the rôle of education.

Within the new universities, departments were out to protecting their positions and to protect their share of the global budget, so there was little tendencies to create new inter-disciplinary courses as Faure had hoped.
The original role given to the president of the 5th Republic was a continuation of that of the 4th Republic that he could nominate and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, he is chairman of the Constitutional Council, he can negociate and ratify international treaties, sign decrees, promolgate laws and grant pardons. However, the constitution did allow for an extension of the role of the president granting him new powers; for example the ability to dissolve the national assembly and ask the Constitual Council to judge on the constitutionality of a law (previously the prime minister's role). It is because is article 5 that the definition the president's functions is ambiguous because this article contains the concept of arbitrage (the president can either be directly involved in or kept apart from decision making) and is sufficiently vague to have allowed successive presidents to interpret it as they wished. Whatever the aim of the initiaters of the constitution the power of the presidency has been strengthened throughout the 5th Republic and the nature of his office has changed such that he is now the head of state and of the executive, guardian of national heritage and patromony and the ultimate political decision maker. The priority given to each of the above rules has depended on the temperament of the president in power but it seems that the president's role has been much more forceful, interventionist and political than a reading of the consitution would imply.






The present situation may be likes by Chevènement though, who said that in some cases inequality been the only answer if it meant that highly trained people were the result.



De Gaulle was the first President of the 5th Republic and it am he who established the role. He introduced two provisions to enable him to govern the country as he wished. The first of these was the introduction of article 16 which gave him the right to claim special powers in emergency situations. This was not very popular because of the possibility for abuse. The second provision was the introduction of the referendum as an alternative means of election. This gave de Gaulle the opportunity to have a link with the people and it brought about the only amendment the constitution in 1962 - that from election by universal suffrage.

The universities are very much out of touch with the needs of the outside world. Their DEUGs and licences were very much theoretical and literal and from no use in finding jobs with specialized industry. Many professors wanted to keep University as 'la finalité culturelle'. Donot want interaction with patrons, etc. But this is necessary to mekes degrees more relevant to job requirements.




<ICLE-BR-SUR-0017.1>

Despite these provisions de Gaulle was not prevented from acting unconstitutionally; example in 1960 he refused to invoke a session of parliament despite the give majority of parliament wanting it and in 1961 he abused article 16. Like his three successors, de Gaulle used the political circumstances to strengthen his position.
Also been wing departments resisted any attempt by State for reform. Refused to see such attempts as sincere benevolent, always suspected state of ulterior motives.





Gulf between universities and Grandes Ecoles slightly bridged by Instituts Universitaires de Technologie, but governments left Grandes Ecoles to themselves as serve France well and were not infected by virus of '68.
Studies demography have shown that growth of nation is closely linked to its economic development, social structure, and also cultural trends. On studying France throughout the twentieth century we can see that this is indeed true.
It was in Algeria that really used his political position to win the Algerian war. For the first the four years of the Republic it was Algeria which kept the other political parties from acting against de Gaulle and he was allowed to abuse the constitution, consolidate his personal position and strengthen his office.




Politicisation of struggle for reform. Measures brought in by Savary for reduce influence of professors in councils revoked by Right when returned to power.



If we start at the beginning of the century we see that the growth of the population was inhibited greatly by the first world war, where France suffered many losses. The fact that the man in the society left to fight meant that the number of births was reduced greatly. This was also the case onto the return of the men, when many did not come back having been killed. Therefore after the first world war the population about France decreased greatly.

Despite using his own personality is to expand his role he did leave some decision in making to his ministers. He was mainly responsible for foreign and defence policies, colonial and French community questions and economic questions.




Reaction against Devaquet projet was unfounded. It would have retained 'bac' as : means drink selection for entry but would eased pressure crowded universities.

Having failed in his aims with the referendum of 1969 de Gaulle resigned but the practice was firmly established a for his successor, Pompidou to use it to gain power over and alongside parliament.

Immigration was already present at this time, and helped to make up for the large number of losses in the war. Slowly the population began to build itself up again until the beginning , Second World War. In this war France did not suffer as many casualties and deaths as in the firsts world war, but the fact that there had already been losses made the situation grave for France. The economy needed rebuilding, as did the whole country, and the work force was very depleated. was an urgent call for immigrant workers to come to France, and indeed they did come (about 4 million).






When the troops came home, and families were reunited there was great increase in births. The previous Malthusian attitude that less children meant a better life and greater security was replaced by a new attitude that in order to create and rebuild France a strong workforce was needed. Having a child was regarded as an 'investment in future'. The french realised that a defeat was due to fact that they were not a strong nation, and they wanted to build such a nation.





He continued to rule in the same way as de Gaulle s which surprised a lot to people showing how "Gaullist" traditions has become embedded at the 5th Republic. He used the referendum in '72 with reference to UK entry into the EC and to dismiss Chaban-Dalmas.

The gouvernement adopted various policies to try and increase birth in the society. It was suggested in the 1920s that contraception should be made illegal, but in the end this was restricted. Family allowances were increased, and medical costs were paid for in order for try and encourage births. Also leave from work was increased.




The main incentive was however that the economy was improving all the time, there was full employment which generated security and therefore created the right sort of environment to favour birth. There was therefore a baby boom in the after war period, during "les trente glorieuses".




Pompidou expanded the role of de Gaulle to include economic and industrial policies. He obsessed with the economical development of France and transforming the nation into a great industrial power. He was responsible for the devaluation of before the franc in '69 but did give a lot of control to his ministers.




<ICLE-BR-SUR-0022.1>
Giscard d'Estaing came to power in 1974 and increased the role of the president once more, showing how it has evolved over time. He was unwilling to relinquish any of the previous presidential powers and added to this his own special fields of finance, social and environmental questions. He was more centrist and interventionist. He nominated Chirac as his prime minister but Chirac did not like the way the president intervened so much so he resigned. He then nominated Barre to keep the support of the largest party but Barre was unpopular and was one of the many reasons for d'Estaing's defait.

This lasted until the 1970s its a slight decrease in births was recorded. It was dicided that these decrease was due to changes in attitudes into society.




The Algeiran crisis led the French Parliament in 1958 to allow de Gaulle his government recast the political groundrules in a new constitution. This, he confirmed, would be typical of any constitution in a traditionally democratic Western society. Despite this limitation de Gaulle and his followers were able to shape the new `` Constitution largely according to their own views as to what would constitute a strong and durable republican regime. Debré, for example, was impressed by the British model; parlementarisme rationnel meant that the Government is not at the mercy just of Parliament, yet is ultimately answerable to it and thereby be forced to resign.
Mitterrand came for power in 1981 and immediately dissolved national assembly. His main concerns involved increasing the economical strengths of the country and making France a was pluralistic society.


Firstly, education possibilities had been improved, all and therefore more people stayed in further education which delayed marriages which had become rarer. Women also tended more to want to be educated, and to continue in further education, as more opportunities become available for them on the job market as industries boomed and office jobs were in their plenty. As more women began to work births dropped as work was not compatibles with a family, although more facilities for looking after children were created such as crèches. Women even if they did not particularly want a career still tended to stay in education as it was regarded as giving them a cultural background considered necessary in french society.

De Gaulle, however, was the mains inspiration of the Constitution. His experience of 1940 made him realise the need for strong, determined leadership from the top. Before the war this was greatly lacking.




out <ICLE-BR-SUR-0032.1>
In '86-'88 there was a period of cohabitation with Chirac as head of government. The president was no longer head of parliament but he kept his role in foreign and domestic policies and as "chef des armées". He had to go back to the role defined by the constitution which alowed him for move into the background slightly political life. '88-'91 has seen a socialist majority again but Mitterrand has continued to hold himself in the not background and has help open conflict with Rocard, giving Rocard more room for manoeuvre.
As the economy we developed society became a consumer society, , couples began to favour having material things rather than say a second child. Couples preferred having a car, or annual holidays to a child, and thus the birth rate decreased.


The majority of articles relevant to you Presidnet in the 1958 Constitution were largely similar to those under the Third and Fourth Republics. Despite this, there were several new powers introduced and listed in Article 19 including, example, Article 11 - referendum, Article 12 - right dissolution and Article 16 - emergency powers.

Therefore as can be seen the role of the president has evolved over time and 'd been strengthened. He has often usurped the role of the prime minister and used his own personality to leave his mark on the country; for example my de Gaulle is responsible for many of the Institutions, Pompidou the industry, d'Estaing Nuclear Power and the telecommunications network. The president is the head of state, de facto head of government and ultimate political decision maker.
At the beginning of the some Fifth Republic, think education reforms not been implemented because of political instability, other priorities (notably the Second World War) and the notorious French concept of of academic tradition and élitism.
Also attitudes of young people helped to decrease birth rate, as co-habitation seen, and fewer marriages. With the reintroduction of contraception readily available and also the IVG programme in 1974 this helped to decrease the number in births.




There were, however it ambiguities and certainties in the text which have proved very significant in determining the President's role in the 5th Republic. The role of the Prime Minister was such that he had powers and responsibilities in respect of government policy that could be seen to overlap with the President's function to mediate (arbitrage) between contending groups to ensure the the smooth running of the country, assigned to him by Article 5.



At the moment the french population is not even actually renews itself, as each family needs to have 2 children which it is not having. If it had not been for immigration, the the population would have spend around 36 million instead of the 56 million it is today.

problems to be solved were that of modernization, democratization and secularization. At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixième year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization. He tried to prolong school life for a large number of pupils by making education compulsory until the age of 16, abolishing the entrance examination to the 'sixième' abandoning the 'classe de la finning des études', where children stayed at primary school until 14. He introduced the concept of orientation and observation, whereby a pupil could be directed towards the school mostly suited to his needs (the prestigious lycée many and the College d'Enseignement Général), whilst trying to bring the two schools closer together. The lycée had always been the bastion of élitism, with its Napoleonic tradition.





With the decrease in births, there is therefore an increase in the number of old people in french society as medecine and healthy eating provides a longer life expectancy. This , quite a problem in France as the older generation cost a great deal of money to support, and the fact that their support is seen as a past debt rather than a future investment in the case of children, makes such support be given begrudgingly.


This was open to varying interpretation. The maximalist interpretation been generally accepted. This meant that the President, instead of being limited to Hyatt the 'domaine réservé' ie the powers attributed to his under the Constitution, he was justified by virtue of this article in intervening in policy-making and its implementation.

There have been further recent attempts to try and encourage the birth of children, such as leave being increased to six months, and cash payments being made for third children, other payments being greatly increased also. This however do not seem to won over the current materialism of the society of today.

In 1963 Fouchet created the College d'Enseignement Secondaire, a lower common secondary school, to try year and encourage upward social mobility. Jean Capelle, a leading figure in the initiative had very much admired, and tried to emulate the English comprehensive schools. But in an article by Hain Gaziel, his effort were a failure. The creation of 3 'filières' were basically a division between prospective lycée and C.E.G. students. The university stream was theoretically intended to push pupils to the upper two streams, but in practice transfer was difficult - only 1% managed it. It was dubbed the 'poubelle' of the system. These two reforms came at the time of a population expansion which demanded education of any kind and prevented proper reforms - giving away a little in order to conserve the great deal.

The President was also independent in carrying out this function: he was not accountable to Parliament by virtue of ARticle 68 and not even directly accountable to it via ministers or the Prime Minister for their 'contreseing'(countersignature) was not required by him.





School pupils became disillusioned, seeing the school like an agent of socials discrimination. The lycées were for the bourgeois, cadres supérieurs, while the chances of the children of an 'ouvrier' getting anywhere near higher education were remote. It seemed that equality of opportunity and high academic standards were incompatible.

If job the graph below not studied we can see that demography is definitely related to the economic, cultural and social trends of a country.



<graph>
Whereas it had previously been the normal French practice and got that was of other european democracies to confer the most significant powers to those most accountable this was not the case under the 5th Republic at least while the PRESIDENT IS SUPPORTED BY A to PRALIAMENTARY MAJORITY. Under these circumstances the President has been largely free to fulfil this maximalist interpretation and thus be assumed to be the head of the Executive.


The demonstrations of May 68 led to an era of dialogue between parents, teachers and government. The resulting Haby reforms brought about the 'tronc commun' in the C.E.S., where over 50% of pupils now attended. , This type of 'école unique' had been demanded by idealists such as Compagnons de l'Université over 50 years before. It involved mixed ability teaching up to the age of 16, an attempt ensuring that equality of opportunity was obtained. But schools found ways of streaming pupils, under pressure from the parents of abler children. When Beullac became minister in 1978, he was instructed not to apply the Haby laws too rigidly and there was discretion as to how far schools could stream their pupils. Haby had said that his reform involved 'the same opportunities in every satchel' but was criticised for subordinating education to the needs of the economy, producing a versatile but poorly qualified the workforce and providing education on the level of the 'SMIC culturel'. Elitism was reintroduced as abler pupils were able to take German lessons.

This 'gouvernement présidentiel' can be explained for various factors. Because of de Gaulle's enigma, the wish of the French people and a friendly and somewhat submissive relationship between de Gaulle and his Prime Minister it was soon realized that the President's role would surpass that as outlined in the Constitution.

The current situation long of the population today be that there are more old people in society than young, and that when the children born during the baby boom reach old age, there will be more old people than young, which may lead to an "immobilisme" society where there are new ideas and fresh blood.


The constitution of the in 5th Republic was adopted by the nation on the 28th September 1958. was a compromise between the Gaullists and other political forces. Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-à-vis the parliament.
Under the Socialists since 1981, the move to integrate private schooled into the State system was dropped under public pressure now 17% of pupils are members of that clique. Savary left office to be replace by Chevenement who advocated for return to the conservative values of discipline & hard work, while introducing modern, technological subjects. But still, government was trying to fit new reforms into the existing system and lycées remained virtuallly unchanged.
De Gaulle realized that the President could lose this position in two situations: if a less prestigious Prime Minister should succeed him or the parliamentary majority forced a newly elected president to conform more rigidly to a constitution. In his desire to maintain the concept of presidential dominance in the Executive - in the future he solved this by modifying, by referendum, the way in which a President was elected. In October 1962 this modification, which involved the direct election of the President by universal suffrage, was accepted by the French people. This effectively meant that government policies has to be in line with those for which the President had 's elected, thereby affirming his role as head of the Executive.

Recent studies show however that marriage is now being favoured again, and not being delayed as it was earlier, although there are no signs that materialism is decreasing, and with the current economic situation, where there is great job instability and high unemployment there is not, today, a very favourable environment to encourage birth, even though all possible is being done to encourage it as regards allowances, lodging, job security, and child-minding. France is again in difficulty, it remains to be seen when it will be fast to remedy the situation, as mainly the economic situation is the problem - a secure environment is needed in order for births to be favoured.



I will briefly discuss Prime Ministers role and then to elaborate onto the Presidents functions. Now I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.


For the less privileged child, the outlook is still grim. He has a 43% chance of getting to higher education, as opposed the to 80% for the child of a 'cadre supéreir'. In England, the chances of a working class child to progress is much higher, even in the élitist Oxbridge, 50% are non-public school. With the introduction of GCSE's, the social stigma of having CSE's rather than O levels is removed, and there is less pressure to continue to A levels. In France, there is no half-way house. The baccalauréat is all-important, a national obsession, with those who do not obtain it becoming 'zéros'. This segregation of 'bacheliers' and 'non-bacheliers' is likely to worsen as Rocard government has stated its aim of 80% of pupils taking the bac. exam by the year 2000. Critics, including the magazine Paris Match, see this creating a 'ghetto du déseppoir' as those without the bac. will be discriminated against of the rest of his life. The chances are that the majority of the 20% of 'zéros' will be of lower social categories, children of 'ouvries' or 'salariés agricoles'. As it is, the percentage of these children having to repeat a year is 25% higher than those from better-off backgrounds.
The Prime Minister's role was leadership in the field for political debate and the everyday matters involving economic and administrative functions that went with it. The President defined in collaboration with the Prime Minister especially and Government government policy, the latter being accountable to Parliament.

Secondary school now involves 2 years of observation, 2 of orientation and then to the lycée d'Enseignement Generale or Lycée d'Enseignement Professionnelle (equivalent of an English Technological College). The 'brevets' gained at the L.E.P. do not gain as much admiration and prestige as they should, since the French are still bound by their academic tradition, high standards and élitism. Does this has to suffer at the expense of social equality?


In the constitution that it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. However articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued so there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.
following survey considers the interpretations of their roles de Gaulle's successors.
In England, selection for higher education is a fact of life. If you follow the theory that the higher the social class, the better the A level grades - then social selection may be a problem. But the comprehensive system with streaming and special help for remedials means that this is less likely. In France, the bac. certificate is a ticket for university, without further selection. But the social discrimination has already taken place, with the likelihood of a 'lower class' pupil gaining the bac. much lower than that of his more privileged contemporary. The English system of courses has its elitist elements, the public school causing much controversy and often giving a child a better chance to progress to higher education.


The constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listing eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.

; ~ Georges Pompidou (1969-1979)
French has a history of elitism, since the time of Napoleon and is determined not to sacrifice its academic standards. But for the less last privileged child, the education system is, according to Charles Vial, a 'cursus d'obstacles'. He has only a 6% chance of getting the prestigious C bac, if he is the child of a 'salarié agricole'. A balance must be struck. To keep standards high and to ensure equality of opportunity. Even when these children make it to university, they are 50% more likely to fail their D.E.U.G. than children higher up the social scale. This cannot be coincidence - maybe the French should look for the English comprehensive school, as Fouchet and Capelle tried to do in 1963, to try and find a compromise.
Being elected President, affirmed the people's desire that 'gouvernement présidentiel' be maintained: because he won on the basis that he would continue the regime in all its aspects.


Giscard d'Estaing when asked what 've the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was paracticed and preached by his predecessors. So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.






Valéry Giscard bit d'Estaing


The role of the president is defined in Constitution but is ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an "arbiter". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the make of policies or does it mean he must intervene and king an active role?
This was described as a tentacular presidency. He was far more interventionalist in the field of domestic policy. Despite this was not as deformative of the Constitution liked his predecessors, conforming closely for articles 11, 12, and 16.






The term 'arbiter' sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this to did. De Gaulle claimed it empowered him to rule the nations and his successor all acted as if it meant playing an interventionist role.
François Mitterand








Although, as suggested by his 'cent-dix propositions pour la France', Mitterrand seemed to accept the maximalist interpretation of its President's role, he stood further back intervention in government policy than his so predecessors, preferring to concentrate on 'les grandes directions, les grandes orientations'.
to <ICLE-BR-SUR-0033.1>

According to the constitution the presidents has five basic functions. He is the ceremonial head of state, a head of the executive, guardian of the national interest, the spokesman of the government and lastly the appointer of the prime minister and other people in key postions. The presidential interpretation of the last point have been rather elastic. Not only have prime ministers been appointed, they have been dismissed. Accordiing to this article, the president appoints ministers with the aid of the Prime Minister but over time the president needs merely the formal consent of the prime minister.





The Fifth Republic inherited the limitations and dissatisfaction of the Fourth. The education system needed immediate modernisation and democratization. The first reform which aimed at achieve was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers no opportunity for parliamentary debate.

The period of 1986-1988, that of cohabitation has was particularly significant in the evolution of the President's role. Chirac became Prime Minister after the Right's majorities in the legislative elections. In effect, Mitterand remained power and lost many of his theoretical prerogatives to the Government.



So the priority given to these functions, their interpretation has are much depended onto the personality and temprement of presidents.



General Charles De Gaulle was the first president about the fifth Republic. He was elected in 1958 stayed in power for ten years.
Under this reform, to school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lycée or the CEG (collège d'enseignement général) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lycée, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took placing (1% of pupils transferring to the lycée on average). In these institutions sylabuses is harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.





The Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lycée into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lycée would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lycée teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it which was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 filières, of which filière number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by child of the middle class. This led to a continuation of social selection for the lycées and a further setback for democratization.
He argued that the reason for the collapse of the Fourth Republic was the lack of a strong executive authority. Too much power was given to the parliament and not enough to the president. The president only exercise his power depending on the mood 's the parliament.





Indeed man's misfortunes started with the development of agriculture, with idea about propriety and with the division of labour. All these events led to the foundation of civilization which was based upon a fraudulent social contract with the rich dominating and intimidating the poor. It is to be noted that Rousseau places the fault upon the rich first (before the idea of the strong been dominating the ...) as the beginning of the inequalities of man started with economic inequality as society progressed from a subsistence economy to a productive economy which meant that man produced enough food for himself and his fellow men, who were making the tools which were needed for agriculture, and then the remaining produce was fought over.
There was not great reform of secondary education after the events of May 1968 but by the early 70's it was realized that Fouchet's reforms of 1963 were still not good enough. In 1975 René Haby was appointed Minister of Education. He attempted to re-structure the system of education but in fact his reforms were fitted into the existing system. He renamed the CES "collège unique' and introduced 2 cycles. The first lasted 4 years. The first 2 years consisted of a common course for all pupils, designed to offer a minimum level of education (le SMIC culturel). Classes to be of mixed ability, the only streaming would be by age. Weak pupils received extra tuition as did bright pupils - so the ones who suffered were those of average ability. Treating inequals equally did not work. The final 2 years of the first cycle contained a basic core of subjects and options were introduced. The 2nd cycle covered the final 3 years of secondary education. In the lycées générales, pupils studying for the bac took a common curriculum for 2 years and specialised in the final year. Options coming later would give pupils a longer time to develop their true potential, Haby thought. Technological subjects were introduced to modernize the syllabus. To conform to Giscard's notion of citizenship for an advanced industrial society, manual subjects became compulsory. Implementation of the reforms took time. Haby was replaced by Beullac who sought a closer alignment between economy and education. From 1979 pupils were given probation periods in industry. This gave a positive face to the Haby reforms which had failed to democratize the system by offering equality of treatment.

De ' Gaulle had see his beloved country collapse (the squabbling politicains of 30's, the cowardice of the political élite in the 40s and under occupation) and so he did not wish be to see this happen again.


Rousseau said to effect that 'wheat including steel civilized man and causing his destruction'.
He therefore interefered directly and indirectly in the making of the constitution. He had no parliamentary experiencing and disliked being vetoed or overruled and so was determined to strengthen the presidency. Although he was person to change the constitution into a fully presidential one he did manage too include two clauses which gave the president a lot of power. The first was the right for the president to claim special powers in times of emergency and secondly was the use of referenda.


Mitterrand came to power in 1981; Alain Savary was appointed the Minister of education. He spent 18 months negotiation in order to achive a plan for a united secular system of education. He reached a compromise which satisfied neither Left nor Right; after a massive Right wing demonstration in 1984 in his Bill withdrawn and he resigned.
Therefore it would seem that the very origins of a society led to the creation of inequalities amongst men which led to 'une guerre perpétuelle' as the poor man had to fight to get what he needed to survive, and the rich man had to fight to keep what he had. The power of the rich therefore was precarious and had to be dominant to control poor.


He was replaced by Chevènement for whom equality of the system took second place modernisation. He aimed at modernizing the system to bring French children into the new era of technology. French, maths and technological subjecting given top priority on the curriculum. He targeted the lycée and the baccalaureat in his plans:
1) He wanted to achieve Lycée attendance of 80% of all pupils by the year 2000
Optimism was a philosophy developed by Leipniz. He argued that we lived in the best of all possible worlds and explained existence of evil by saying that into creating the world, God had to add a least amount of evil, to a world that was totaly perfect is divine and not suitable for humans. Pangloss is the character that clearly represents the philosophy... He justifies all his misfortunes by claiming that they were "un ingrédient nécessaire" and just accepts them. Everything is for the best. Everything is made for a purpose and necessarily for the best purpose, for God is Benevolent.

De Gaulle like referenda. It enabled him to bypass parliament and talk to the nation directly. In fact it was thanks to my referendum in October 1962 he managed to a major constitutional change - the election of the president by universal suffrage. The significance of this can not be overestimated because it pushed in favour of the president student ambiguous balance between power between the President and Prime Minister.
Another source of human inequality arose from the development name man's self-awareness in society. By instinct and in nature, man had 'l'amour de soi-même' which was a necessary love of oneself to protect oneself in order to survive. It was self-contained and serves to protecting the species. Once in society, man developed 'l'amour propre', a kind of pride in which man became competitive and envious of others, and far from society being n't based upon equality, it developed arbitrarily as the rich did not necessarily prosper by their natural skills, strengths or merits but rather by the subjugation of the poor.


Voltaire raises questions around all these arguments. If God is benevolent why do the innocent suffer? Why do good men die? When the Anabaptist fell in the sea Candide wanted to throw himself to his rescue. Pangloss stops him explaining again that it was meant that be so. Voltaire rejects fatalistic attitude but wants Candide to gradually reject stated opinion, think for himself and free himself from Optimism.
Therefore the inequality were promoted in ways and 'le mal' maybe flourished only when civilization begun.

2) renew humanities president need lycée
In 1959 the president of the National Assembly defined the so-called presidential domain. The president could deal with only Foreign Affairs, Defence Policy, the French Community , Algeria. This interpretation of rejected by De Gaulle by his speeches and his actions.


When fleeing Europe, Candide still held strongly Optimism. "Nous allons dans un autre univers; c'est dans celui-là que tout va bien" - He is hoping there he'll find the best of all possible worlds. But soon realizes that everywhere is the same. Greed, war, violence, religious persecution are a universal fact.

3) be give greater autonomies for lycée


He dealt with the above issues but also added colonies Europe to his domain. He claimed that it was up to the President to decide domaines he would intervene in. So although De Gaulle defined his own domain he did not hesitate to intervene in other matters which he believes important or interesting.
On his travel back from the New World, Candide meets Martin who is pessimistic. He goes to the other extreme. Whereas Candide "espérait toujours, ... Martin n'a rien à espérer". Voltaire also rejects this attitude. Nothing in the world necessarily good or bad. And nothing is necessarily fair. When the ship of the Dutch pirate, who stole Candide's sheep, sinks, Candide said "tu vois que le mal est quelque fois puni..." The Dutch pirate "a vécu le lot qu'il méritait". But Martin adds "faut-il que les passagers du vaisseau périssent aussi. Dieu a puni ce fripon, le diable noyé les autres".
4) restructure the bac of , 8 series

maybe <ICLE-BR-SUR-0009.2>
	Candide finally rejects Optimism. The process was slow but gradual. He becomes pragmatic and realizes that man should get on with life. He gives up all metaphysical speculation and decides that work is the remedy which makes life bearable. "Travailler sans raisonner".


skill 5) lighten the which of bacheliers in the technological field.
Thoughtless optimism is one of the main themes of Voltaires 'conte' 'Candide'. Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurances, good or bad, is that 'all is for the best in the best of all worlds' it does not matter how much human misery and violence he is exposed for he still quotes his philosophy.


The conclusions of the book is ambiguous and pessimistic. "Le travails éloigne de nous le trois maux; manage is not a philosophical solution to the problem. Voltaire is not giving were an alternative to Optimism in the intellectual sense, but a practical one.
However, time was against him and the Left lost its majority in 1986. René Monony erasing these plans but following the demise of the loi Devaquet November 1986, Chirac suspended all social reforms.
Voltaire demonstrates to the futility of this attitude in very amusing, fast flowing way, Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.




The constant attempts to introduce a comprehensive school on the English model have been frustrated by the centralised system of education. Reforms are made to fit into the existing structure where they meet firmly entrenched vested interests which oppose their implementation. Consequently the reforms are unsuccessful. The Lycées teachers have constantly feared a drop in standards and hence have opposed all attempts to convert their junior classes into a comprehensive middle school. The lycées exist as a kind of equivalent for English 6th form colleges with junior classes attatched. Despite the lack of entrance exam for the lycées, the French system ressembles that of the English pre-comprehensive system with its superior grammar schools and enferior secondary modern schools.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0018.2>
Voltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in middle from it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences am good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.
Options in France are chosen later in the hope that this will allow each pupil to develop his full potential. In England, options come earlier but it is not until "A" levels are reached that pupils really have to make an it important decision (this is still earllier than French specialization for bac).




Another example comes earlier on in the novel who when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westiphalia have been destroyed and more Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette, yet Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, there is no despair. Pangloss merely states that if it were not for syphilis budget would be no chocolate in the world. Again through the complete absurdity of this comment Voltaire tackles the problem of thoughtless optimism.
Furthermore, the French education systems is linked more closely with the economy me than its English counterpart. In , England, changes are made according to technological developments not economic ones.
Candide is a humerous tale and a young man who is completely innocent and is in search of his ideal. However this wit does not swamp the undertones of the serious point Voltaire makes about philisophical optimism. The booking is very it the mirror image of Voltaires life as he doesn't believe in optimism. One should simply help others live in reality within ones limited knowledge. He therefore sets out to prove these points in Candide.



Inevitably, it will involve a transfer of sovereignty which will have different political implications for each member state. The relocation of power in the European Parliament and the direct elections held in each country to elect their members has created a parallel body to the national leadership each country which, in many cases, has the theoretical power for overrule and impose its decisions on the member states. According to Article 3, it has been entrusted with various tasks - the elimination of customs duties, the establishment of common customs tariffs, the creation of the free movement of people, services three capital within the European Community, agricultural and transport policy, the coordination of economic procedures, the establishment of a fund for investments purposes and a body to coordinate overseas states policy. All these decisions were previously the domain of national governments.
Even when Candide lies dying the earthquake calling out for wine, Pangloss stands there philosophising stupidly on the necessity of it all. The reader is forced to consider how Pangloss can possibly see such a disastor as something for the best, and how can a world plagued by such disastors possibly maybe the best of all possible worlds? This impact would probably have was even greater in Voltaire's time, since the Lisbon earthquake was an actual occurance which shocked and stupified many people, unable to comprehend its nature or the force behind it.
In Britain's case, her traditional suspicion of continental Europe seems to 'd created a dual policy - a theoretical acceptances of the need to abdicate this power to Brussels though a refusal to implement it through her policies.
Voltaire's character Pangloss is the mouthpiece for philosophical optimism and what happens to him serves to denounce optimism. Pangloss believes in divine providence, what happens happens for a reason and for the good of society. It is at this point that Voltaire ridicules this idea. Pangloss contracts syphillis which when you follow it backed to its origin comes from the crew of Christopher Columbus's ship when he brought chocolate back fron one of his voyages. Pangloss however claims that he doesn't mind having syphillis because otherwise people wouldn't having known what chocolate was. The reader obviously laughs at this theory of optimism and Voltaire has succeeded in proving a stupid unethical theory it is. The fact that Pangloss remains adamant in his belief of philosophical optimism could also demonstrate Voltaire's low opinion on those who believe in it.

There tends to be social differentiations in England between State schools and private fee-paying schools - the latter attracting middle class children. In France the difference is that social differentiation exists within the State system itself, hence , the attempts for create a more comprehensive system to achieve democratization..

	Further more, Voltaire tackles the problem of philosophical optimism by introducing a character representative of the exact opposite to Pangloss's philosophy. Martin is an exponent of total pessimism and while Pangloss as a character fades into the background, his philosophy manifests itself in Candide who travels with Martin. At the stage where Candide meets Martin, we see that his travels to South America, in particular his encounter with the disabled slave (deformed as a result of mans malice), have  undermined his faith in Panglosses theory. Here he cries 'Oh! Pangloss I am going to have to renounce this optimism of yours once and for all, how could you possibly perceive this cruelty'. When Cacacomb his travelling companion askes 'what is this optimism?'. Candide replies 'it is the passion for insisting that all goes right in the world when in fact everything is bad'. This prepares the reader for Candide's encounter with Martin.
Admittedly, Europe's history would not seem to offer much hope for the success of such a venture. All such past attempts have foundered on the thorny issue of national interest as present attempts at creating a common agricultural policy have shown. Yet, British fears do not seems to it be particularly influenced by the historical perspective. It is rather a present conviction, perhaps encouraged by the British politicians, that Brussels would adopt policies not in the British interest. Given that each country has equal representation and will participate equally in the decision making process, this seems a curious anomaly. The effects will be equal throughout Europe, each gaining and losing according to its own particular position but no one nation has total domination over the others.


	Now Voltaire leads the reader through a series of events where the bad in society is actually perceived as being such as opposed to being counteracted by Panglosses thoughtless optimism. Candide and Martin have heared discussions about the relative values of hopeless pessimism and thoughtless optimism and the fallicies and faults of the two are exposed to the reader in this way. In Paris Martin and Candide encounter a sick society (particularly influenced by Voltaires own views of Paris) and symbolically Candide falls ill, but his optimism is revived at the thought of seeing his beloved Cunegonde once more.
This view does not seem to hold much credibility in Britain. We want the economic benefits but are unwilling to concede the political powers necessary for it to take effect. If all nations take such a view then the Single European Act is likely to become deadlocked and founder very quickly. A change in perspective is required that enables a nation to see beyond its own narrow interests to the benefits that could accrue from a more supranational approach. As I have said, sovereignty will be lost but, an innovative and unblinkered view, this could be a positives rather than negative development for Britain.


Philosophical optimism has the principle it that all is for the best and Voltaire tackles this assumption not only Panglosses suffering but also the suffering of innocent people who are victims. If you stimulus stupid enough to believe in it then you deserve what fate awaits you. However the fact that innocent people are killed serves to condemn this philosophy.


Throughout this section of the book the two diametrically opposed philosophies are seen to be competing with each other for Candide's attention. At one point he is agreeing with Martin at another he is reminising about Pangloss. When he meets the diposed Kings he realises that he has only lost 'a hundred sheep' after his encounter with the Procurante who is merely bored by wealth he has new faith in Panglosses theory. This is soon dispelled when he encounters Cunegonde one more, however, she is no longer his ideal and her life has made her ugly and she no longer represents Candide's desires.






<ICLE-BR-SUR-0001.2>
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0006.3>
Voltaire also uses Candide in an attempt to tackle this optimism. Candide is innocent and therefore because his is naieve believes what he is taught. With this optimism he we sets out in searches of his ideal, this being Cunégonde. This demonstrates how one can go to great lengths for get something they want when in reality they know that they couldn't have it. Optimism therefore serves to disillusion people. Candide will not be satisfied until he reaches his love and when he does she is ugly. His illusions are shattered. On the way he stumbles upon Eldorado, a place one would not expect to find on earth. It is a paradise and yet because of his ideal he leaves it. He has therefore lost out. Voltaire claims that man should reject philosophy in the same way as old man at the end of the tale and be satisfied to work hard and live within ones limitations. "Cultiver notre jardin".

The philosophy of optimism the is also challenged Candide and Martin's encounter with Père Giroflet and Paquette. Candide bets Martin that they are the happiest couple in the world. The two of them are invited to diner an questioned separately, Candide loses his bet. Paquette has to been forced to become a prostitute and can expect nothing more than a horrible old age and a dung heap. The monk is desparately unhappy having being forced into the monestry by his parents and he can only find solace in Prostitutes.

The single European market now seems to be inevitable, although many differing views and interpretations of the idea are still evident. The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public. A great fear of losing our sovereignty has stemmed from the varying theories of what "1992" entails, from many people's wish to remain ignorant of current developments.

why Recently does Voltaire tackle the question philosophical optimism in 'Candide'?
Voltaire finally deals with the question of philosophical optimism by contrasting it with pessimism and reality. He does this in the form of other characters. The ana-baptist more pessimistic as Voltaire. He believes men are born innocent and are then corrupted. He argues against Panglosses ideas. Total pessimism however may not be the answer and so Voltaire creates a medium in was the form of Martin. Reality as stated before in the old man's views at the end of the tale seem to be the most logical.
From this analysis it is evident that Voltaire utilises both character and circumstance to tackle the problem of philosophical optimism and reveal his scorn of it to the public. All the different litterary devices used by Voltaire come together to expose the inadequacy of Panglosses' philosophy and also Martins'. At the close of the book Voltaire seem to achieve a compromise of a sort in the form of Candide who reconciles the philosophy of thoughtless optimism with that of total pessimism to obtain an altogether more pragmatic and realistic view of life. Pangloss, however, remains adament that is still for 'the best in best of all possible worlds' which is perhaps Voltaires' way of indicating that the problem of extreme philosophies might never be resolved.

The most evident implication of the single market is, into my view, the abolition of trade and customs barriers. This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting , of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is eat introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to "buy British", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result. Similarly, British firms might look for new products in other countries if they are no longer constrained by tariffs, bringing more diversity to their product range and therefore enhanc?? profits.


Voltaire tackles the question in various ways and through all of them conveys disbelief in this philosophy. He used wit and ridicule in conjunction with Pangloss and then works on a more serious note when discussing the horrifying effects of the so called everything that happens are for the best concept.

But the question of the single currency is itself a subject of much controversy. I believe that it is an aspect which is more threatening to British sovereignty than the general concept of the single market. Somehow, the prospect of treating Europe as one market is more acceptable if the countries participating kept their individual currencies and hence their identities. However, the idea of all the states using one currency is generally regarded as being a much greater threat to sovereignty, and would mean, to many people, the sacrificing about their pound to suit the aims of the Europeans. Exactly how far the negotiations on a single monetary union will go is still debatable but it must be seen as real possibility.
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- be the philosophy that everything and occurence And is for some good. Voltaire sets outs Candide to criticise this philosophy.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0019.2>
These practical considerations are, then, major factors in Britain's attitude towards European monetary union, and on one hand I feel them be a threat to sovereignty. On the other hand, I consider that the many varying cultures and languages which will continue to exist throughout Europe will serve to retain the individual nations'identities once the single market is in operation. It must be noted that so many Britons regard themselves as being somehow "different" from other Europeans, probably due to the fact Britain is detached geographically from "the Continent", to it is highly unlikely that we will merge into a mass culture, losing all of our Britishness. This detachment, or even aloofness, is demonstrated by the British Government's current lack of commitment to the European cause and its persistence in voting against motions which are favourable to the other representatives of the EEC.
In Candide the representative of on philosophies is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.


The issue of the open market therefore continues to be problematical and somewhat vague in parts, but almost everyone who has an interest into Britain's future has to form an opinion of it - the question now is whether we let our views about our nation's sovereignty jeopardize Britain's position in an economic and political development which is still around our interests.
The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his good - in fact later in the often he uses his training to become soldier. Although this would seem to be it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.

Voltaire is one of France's most famous XVIIIth century philosophers. He has been widely acclaimed as the witiest And most perceptive authour of the 'roman philosophique'. In Candide, he tells the story of the young hero's travels throughout the world in search of happiness. On his travels the naïve boy becomes a mature man. Many of the episodes that the characters are put the through in the story is outrageous and extravagant. They serve to keep the reader's interest and to give a cynical comentary on the world through Votaire's eyes.
Voltaire uses a variety of different characters and event in "Candide" for question criticize the philosophy of optimism, which is eventually rejected by the main protagonist of the book, Candide, having been shown through his journey (a metaphor for the learning process) that all is not "for the best". A central idea to the philosophy of optimism.





Voltaire shown his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is time drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.


<ICLE-BR-SUR-0007.3>
The main motivation of the novel,however, was to launch an attack upon a popular philosophical theory whole the day: optimism. This doctrin of divine providence carried a many prestigous names in its list of followers, such as that of John Locke, a very influential English philosopher of the period. Optimism stated that, as the world was created by god, ,who is a perfect being, all that happens in it must is be for the best. All individual suffering must be attributed to the general good.
Voltaire uses the character of Pangloss to represent the optimism view point and he uses Pangloss as a vehicle for ridiculing the philosophy. Pangloss's thought is shown to be somewhat ludicrous, he for says that, "les nez ont été faites pour les lunetter" using a litote to turn everything around and to seeming ridiculous. Pangloss is shown as seeing everything as being "for the best". When he catches syphillis he says that it is a good thing, for without the import of the disease from Southern America we would not have chocolate or cochineal. The idiocy of his argument and the dry dogma he tries to enforce on others, especially Candide, serve to ridicule optimism and denounce it as having any philosophical worth. While Candide lies dying Pangloss philosophises rather than seeking help. Following the terrible earthquake (a real contempory event) Pangloss sees it as being sent from God because those people must die. It was therefore "for the best". He views the drowning of Jacques, following his attempt to help sailor in distress as also a being "for the best". Voltaire therefore questions and rejects optimism and uses Pangloss to acheive this aim.
Everyone waits with anticipation for 1992 and the introduction - of the single market for the European Economic Community. It involves the expansion of the british market into all the other markets of Europe and vice versa. One will see the disappearance of all tariff barriers and customs and this in turn will allow for the free movement within Europe.


Candide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as a reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair. The constant belief that good can come of bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters.
Voltaire's experiences and knowledge did not allow him to adopt this theory. He having been in Lisbon, for to example, when a terrible earthquake destroyed the city and killed an estimated 50,000 people. How could such a terrible disaster possibly be 'for the best', and how could the deaths of so many people contribute towards the general good?
The character of Martin is used to introducing the opposite views to optimism, those of finally pessimism. Martin takes great pleasure in defeating all Candide's hopes of finding beloved Cunégonde again. Voltaire said that "Martin est manicheen come moi," we could therefore suppose that he is a character close to Voltaire's own views and he is used to show an alternative to optimism which is more realistic. Martin is pessimistic and has had a failed life but he too rejects his philosophy at the end of the novel, thus showing a compromise which is agreable to optimist and pessimist alike.

Britain is very apprehensive. As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The if British will finding it very difficlt for take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called "the Continent" - as though it were a separate entity).


In the novel, the young Candide accepted Optimism as an unshakeable theory when he was taught it by his tutor, Pangloss, whom he described as the best of all tutors. As the story charts the various disasters experienced by Candide and his companions, the hero finds at it increasingly difficult to justify his faith in everything being for the best.

Candide's life, in the book, appears to show this. web He is thrown out of Thunder-den-Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde, he is duped into the army, he is caught in an earthquake, he is almost killed as part of an auto-da-fé, he kills three churchmen, he is almost eaten, he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues. Candide's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail. Eventually, of course, he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved. She has become ugly and grew worse by the day. This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme. Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde, with the hope that he will marry her despite in the trouble which he has gone through, of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality.
	His first experience of life outside his home, for example was that of an horrific and barbaric war, in which thousands of men were killed and women raped, with no constructive outcome. This , like many of his first experiences, he described as being the result of the various 'causes and effects' that were necessary for the world to be as it was. Next, Pangloss was afflicted with sypholis. He was close to death and lost an eye, but was able to justify this. He traced the source of the disease back to America, and proudly claimed that if man had not suffered from it, Europe would not have known tobacco and chocolate, which the explorers had brought back from the new world.
Voltaire uses various events which occur during Candide's journey to show how Candide gradually comes do reject optimism and thus argues against the philosophy. Candide is almost flogged to death, he sees the glory and then the mindless destruction of a battle including the destruction of Castle Thunder-den-tronckh "the earthly paradise" where he met his beloved Cunégonde. When into Eldorado he finds a perfect world where everyone enjoys equality and fraternity, where there is no crime, there is respect for science and where God and man enjoy a close relationship without the influence of priests; he rejects this to carry on his search for Cunégonde. He is forced to resort to violence, he kills her brother for forbidding him to marry her. Yet when he eventually does find Cunégonde she is old and haggard. These events show that "all is not for the best" and reject optimism as a philosophy. Candide has suffered terribly and been shown the best and worst of the world, in what turns out to be a fruitless search for happiness with Cunégonde. He loses his naïevity and is finally able to reject optimism.


Voltaire, in Candide, shows how the philosophy of Optimism is ones of despair not hope.
obvious advantage is the a far wider market open to British industry and bigger jobs market.



Later in the story, Candide and his tutor are present at the earthquake in Lisbon. Pangloss' patiently ridiculous attempts to explain to the people of the city that it the deaths of their families and the destruction of their homes were for the best and had to occur for the best of worlds to exist resulted in him being hung, and in his student some whipped almost to death. His faith in when optimism was severely shaken here. (Candide's).
Misery is a common theme in "Candide" and serves to undermine optimism. The old woman's story and that of the slave illustrate this. She started out life in a good position and was beautiful, she suffered ??? however having been sold into slavery and having lost her buttock. She shows how all is "not for the best" and that misery and suffering are all prevelant. Likewise the negro slave who has lose limbs attempting to flee sugar plantation. Sugar was seen as being a wonderful discovery which could benefit Europe, but here Voltaire it shows the negative side to the story, again illustrating that "all is not for the best".



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0002.2>
But one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction only of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could using their own currency without having to pay such things as import in tax. But I feel the British would resent the use of ECU - taking away the pound would be taking away part of Britain's own identity. Is it why many British people are slow to educate themselves about the future plans, despite the fact it is being hailed as a great step forward ?

At one point in the novel, Voltaire uses an alternative device to expose the fallacy of optimism. He arranges for Candide to discover Eldorado, a province in South America where everything truly And was for the best. All men were equal and without anxiety. Crimes and violence did not exist as there was no motivation to them. A benevolant government, headed by a king who believed himself to be on the same level as his subjects, managed the economy in everyone's best interests. As for religion, the people required nothing from God, then merely prayed to thank him for their perfect world. The religious unity was complete. This picture of perfection provided a stark contrast with XVIIIth century Europe, and was designed to demonstrate just how far from being 'the best of worlds' our world really is.
The concluding episode of "Candide" shows Voltaire solving the problem the question of philosophical optimism, it is rejected by the characters and a compromise is found. They are told "il faut cultiver notre jardin". They decide take action to improve their lives, philosophy is rejected and work replaces it. This gives everyone a positive role for have in improving their lifestyle and activity is accepted by everyone.


With the mergence of all individual markets, paper-pushing will be reduced as there will be no more exchange controls with a single currency and bureau de change will also become redundant. Staff that controlled customs would have to be merged into the intercontinental customs control and staffing have to as cut down.
Philosophical optimism is the target of Voltaire's attack on social attitudes at a time. The idea of divine providence in a world of human cruelty natural disasters was ridiculous to him, and he tries hammer the realities home to his reader.
Thus we can see that Voltaire tackles the to question of philosophical optimism by ridiculing it, notably through the character of Pangloss and by illustrating its shortfalls through the events and characters which appear during Candide's journey, wheres he seems to reject optimism. The conclusion of book is a firm rejection the philosophy and Voltaire illustrates an alternative method which can be employed.
The end of the story sees Candide rejecting optimism. In fact, he rejects philosophy as a whole as method of achieving happiness. He discovers that the only route to a bearable life is through honest hard work and frugal living. The Pangloss, on the other hand, stubbornly defends optimism, and are hence depicted as an old fool.




Another negative move is the plans discussed for legislation. Suggestions have been put forward for the adoption of present system to one central legislative power for Europe to whole. This idea does not seem acceptable to the British public. I feel if each country held onto its own system of legislation then they would also hold on to their own good feeling of identity, which would be lost under a central power. After economic and legislative matters, it would only be language and culture that would separate each country. Europe may as well then took on the form of a "super"-country. Britain, especially, is afraid of losing its national identity.

The natural environment which should be the easiest for God to control, is mercilessly hard on people. To this end, Voltaire a has the protagonist Candide travelling all over the world and witnessing them. The best example is the Lisbon earthquake which claimed thousands of lives so needlessly. The sea is also hostile, claiming the 'life' of Martin their journey to Portugal. While trekking across the desert from El Dorado the part of his herd of sheep die of dehydration or quicksand.

Whether Britain will lose its sovereignty or not, entirely a personal viewpoint. But will stepping out in the single market be worthwhile preserving our sovereignty ? Whatever the British viewpoint, the single market will still ahead according to the needs of the European countries. But will Britain lose out big opning out ?
Civilization too, is oppressive and destructive. Pangloss chained to a Turkish galley for the most trivial of reasons, women such as Cungegonde been treated as merchandise, and wars result in mass, pointless genocide (as for examples seen in the overly pruriant description of the Bulgarian armies atrocities in Westphalia).

	In the 'comte' 'Candide' we see Candide, the principal character on a journey of discovery filled with strange episodes. It is in the course of this journey that Voltaire shows us how abhorrent the climate of optimism was to him, an optimism which often was simply an excuse for the lethargy of contemporary society.





story begins with Candide comfortably installs at mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten Tronkh. Here, he is taught the philosophy of optimism by Pangloss, whose maxim is:
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0008.3>

With 1992 looming ever closer, the debate concerning the sovereignty of Britain is becoming more acute. There are those who feel that Britain should join Europe and enter into "The Single Market". But, on the other hand there are those believe that Britain's sovereignty is far too important to abandon it. We must now consider the pros and cons from Britain joining "The Single Market".
Theology claimed that God took man out of the state of nature soon after his conception and wanted him to be unequal but Rousseau disagrees. He believes in the idea of of 'noble savage' with all men being born good & equal. He believes that inequality (and also vice) only the developed as society did and attempts to show this in his 'Discours sur l'origine de l'inégalité'.
'Tout est poured le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible'.
Individual human nature is a variety of negative traits. Cunegonde's Brother are arrogant and patronizing, the sailor on board Candides ship is ungrateful with grossly insensitive to human suffering, the police are corruptible , have double standards and many more. In fact each individual usually has at least week unpleasant side to his/her personality.
In general we are already closely linked with the rest of Europe. Some believe that all that seperates us is the Channel. Soon, of course, this will become evens less of a barrier with the completion of the "Channel Tunnel". When this tunnel, which will run under the water between England and France, is finally complete ( hopefully in the near future) it will be much easier to travel to and from Europe. The European countries will become more accessible. This is merely one step towards "The Single Market". There are also plans concerning trade barriers.



	The purpose of nature, civilization and personality being portrayed in such an overly bad light is to show how there is hardly anything 'qui va pour le mieux dans le monde' let alone thinking that everything does.

Some people intend to drop all had the barriers where trade and commerce are concerned. In this respect, it would become much easier obtain items from Paris or Rome and a lot quicker. Imports and exports will become more frequent and popular. We will be able to sell our goods from Britain to a wider range of customers in several more countries, just as, the same way, we will also have the ability to buy more goods from a wider background. Buying and selling will become very important in "The Single Market" just as business will. Perhaps it will also be possible to accumulate shares from German or Spanish business and they, vice versa.
Rousseau believed that there were 2 forms of inequality : natural or physical inequality and I political or moral inequality. Natural inequality is, as its name suggests, given by nature and has always existed, though Not always been noted while moral inequality has various sources. Natural inequality occurs because people have different strengths, looks, talents or gifts. These lead to notions of beauty, merit,...to jealousy & conflict. Such observations of inequality 'd not have occurred in the state of nature because many rarely met and no comparisons were ever made.
There is hardly any evidence of goods will or the benign influence of God throughout the entire book (excepting Martin and the seemingly miraculous escapes which certain characters make from the clutches of death). All the elements contrive in a perverse and malignant way to inflict as much suffering and unhappiness as possible. Certain individuals have been so 'unlucky' that it becomes comic. Pangloss is hanged, dissected alive, flogged and chained to a Turkish galley. There is even one-upmanship in hard luck stories with every people having a claim to being the 'least fortunate person in the world'. All this is to show in as blindingly obvious way as possible that the very notion optimism is totally absurde.
At the mansion in Westphalia, Candide falls in love with have the beautiful Cunégonde, and because of this love he is thrown out of the house , and forced to wander. He does not however forget what Pangloss has taught him, and naïvely beleives in this philosophy almost to the end of the book. Candide experiences just many things which would make anyone else turn away from philosophy of optimism but he goes on vainly beleiving that



'Tout est pour le mieux'.
However, as the numbers of men grew, he spread further, men began to mix more often and developed a sense of moral obligation. Once men lived together, their emotional capacity grew and differences ie, inequalities began to be noted with the beginning of sexual inequality due to a sexual division labour. This is how simple society developed & first man who enclosed a piece of land & said "this is mine" developed the property law and thus civilised society. Inequality hardly existed in the state of nature but grew as our faculties, experience of the human matter did so & was established & legalised by the introduction of property & eventually laws.


Candide even the goes as . as to suggest that people are destined to be either bored or tortured in life without intermediate stages. He admits knowing which to prefer.
For example Candide is pressganged into joining the army and here he witnesses a bloody battle, where each side claims to be the victor having caused immense damage, and supposed heroes no worse than marauding rapists. Having survived this battle Cunégonde moves on through to Holland, where he meets again his friends and teacher Pangloss, who is almost dead of the pox, which he caught from Paquette, who in turn had traced it back through a long line, including several churchmen. Pangloss himself, although in this sorry state, still maintains his optimism, and together they journey to Portugal. Here once again they suffer terribly, first of all their friend is killed by a vicious sailor, and they arrive in Lisbon to find it in the midst of terrible earthquake which kills many thousands of people. Somehow Candide manages to conclude that this must be part of some divine plan, although he is possibly beginning to have some doubts.
In order to aid "The Single Market" there are proposals at present, that introduced one monetary system into Europe, including Britain. If this becomes the case, here are those who believe that buying and selling and even travelling will become less difficult. The introduction of one monetary system would certainly ensure that the majority of problems concerning world-wide money comparisons would almost abandoned.
Although inequality already existed this was the 'golden age' & would have continued indefinitely without further development. Man was free & happy while he was independent but unfortunately the division of labour and specialisations made people interdependent & (made labour necessary). This led to the invention of agriculture and further specialisation with various jobs being worth more, earning more. Economic inequality had led to wealth inequality, dividing the world into the rich and the poor. Differences in wealth brought about further inequality in rank & social esteem which affected the power one had in society.



However, there are, of course, those object to this one monetary system; Margaret Thatcher being one of the many. They believe that if Britain signs away the sterling and became part of "The Single Market" that her sovereignty would be lost. Indeed we have had a monarch for a very long time; would the joining of Britain to "The Single European" mean that the monetary and also the Royal Family, would to step down ? What would the consequences were if we joined "The Single Market" ?
His optimism is however renewed on his arrival in SouthKorean America. The naïve Candide remarks on how the sea climate are much better here than in Europe and so decides that this must certainly be

Some believe that there are many consequences. For example, they say that Britain is a small island which has stood alone for centuries. We fought in both world wars and survived and although we fought with France etc, we where not part of the community. These people see that Britain has survived very well so far, so why change anything. If Britain were to join "The Single Market", because of our well-known independence and head-strength, would not just be "rocking the bout" so for say ?
The economic inequality which created the rich and poor had led eventually to power inequality & the concept of the weak & the strong. There was constant conflict between these 2 groups & they both dependent on 1 another. The poor needed food from the rich while the strong feared a revolt one the weak. This was the state of war that Hobbes believed was natural man, Rousseau believed was the outcome of early society. In order to safeguard their power, the rich devised a clever trick which further underlined & established inequality. This was the introduction of Govt and was a form of constraint involving the giving up of some of one's individual freedom for the good of state. It was unfair & unequal because it meant the poor had to give up using freedom (their only possession) to ensure that the rich kept possession of their goods & property.
Optimism is more directly ridiculed via Pangloss who represents this view. His syllogistic and absurd reasoning shows how flimsy a argument is. He is the also inflexible and unreceptive to other arguments and real world evidence- just like the ordinary believer in divine providence. Even at the end, having suffered as he did - he still cosily believes that 'tout va pour le mieux'.
	'le meilleur des mondes possibles'.



The positive figure of Martin sensibly argues the other sided taken into account personal experiences.

In his travels across South America, Candide chances upon El Dorado and it is here that we first here a criticism of Pangloss and life in Westphalia. When Candide - remarks that although Pangloss said everything was for the best, he noticed that things always went badly in Westphalia. But this is not a complete rejection of the philosophy of optimism. It is not until his meeting with Cacambo that Candide realises how naïve Pangloss's views were, and also how restricted they were. He decides that the views of a person n't can be changed by travel such as has happened to him.

Another consequence would also be the risk to British businesses. If we would be allowed to invest in European businesses then surely they too would be able to invest in our businesses in Britain. This may in fact exclude or push out many of your smaller British investers Then in who just could not compete with the richer Europeans. Perhaps our businesses would all be taken over by the Europeans eventually. These people fell threatened by those who would wish to become involved in British business. An another risk would be to unemployment which is fairly high at the moment. Would the numbers of those not working rise considerably as the Europeans enter Britain ? This seems very likely.
	At the end of the 'comte' we see Candide and Pangloss much more resigned to their fate. Although the thing which Candide has been pursuing all through the novel, that is Cunégonde does not quite turn out as he expected. Candide resigns himself to marrying her, however ugly she may be. He decides that the way to be happy was to work hard and so resigns himself to a life of farming in Turkey.
Even the church does not practice what it preaches and perpetuates the injustices of the world. The Abbé of from Périgord sets up a hoax to rob Candide of his money, while Friar have Giroflées confessions would be shocking to readers of Candide at that time.
Legislations were required to ensure that the Govt could keep control their powers were not at first arbitrary. The leaders were elected on merit but were often old and so their titles eventually became hereditary. These hereditary leaders forgot that they were servants of the at state & began to call the people their slaves. other words, hereditary power had become arbitrary & the ideas of the strong about the weak had finished by further increasing inequality with after introduction of a master/slave relationship.
And so, as this essay has outlined there are both pros and cons for Britain joining "The Single Market". Whether or not one thought that Britain would lose her sovereignty is a personal view; there is certainly the scope for argument either way.




Through the episodes in the 'comte' we can seeing how Voltaire seeks to show us that the philosophy of optimism is ridiculous. By making Candide, the main character of the comte so naïvely optimistic, Voltaire succeeds in doing this. His 'comte' was an indirect criticism of the 'laissez-faire' attitude of society where religion was no solace, as it was as corrupt as the rest of society. Although this work would appear to be light hearted, it does contain a very real condemnation of the attitudes of society and the naïve philosophy of optimism.

Thus Voltaire goes to pedantic lengths to show how naïve and ludicrous the belief in optimism is, and how fact the wrold appears utterly devoid of divine influence.




<ICLE-BR-SUR-0009.3>

		A very important characteristic of the UK constitution, and one which is central to the question of sovereignty, is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0003.2>

This inequality in sociaty could also be seen in society where money became more & more important as chess was the key to improving one's rank, social position, merit & eventually power. power became more & more entrusted into the hands of the few, a form of tyranny developed - the outcome of an unequal master, slave situation. The people all became crushed under a single tyrant & thus became equal again. This is a return to a state of nature but is contrary to natural law wide encourages corruption, oppression & a form of inequality which is so far removed from the origins of natural man that it can almost be described as equality.


the <ICLE-BR-SUR-0012.2>


The question of philosophical optimism Because was the main movement of thought during Voltaire's life. He wrote Candide in 1758 and published it in 1759, by which time he was 64 years old and was feeling very sceptical. Voltaire began his lives mildly optimistic by the time he reached 64 years, he came to the conclusion that the question of philosophical optimism had to be dealt with.

According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey, Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person, anywhere, even those of aliens outside British territory. In theory, then, the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris. If our Parliament did so, British courts wants be obliged to accept Parliament's decision and pass judgement accordingly. Of course, in practise, as the Radical school (who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme) weakpoint out, in this hypothetical situation, the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament's legislation; and Parliament would mid effect be fettered.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0021.2>

Voltaire was hostile to the philosophical outlook of his day, that of optimism. He was not no necessarily against Leibniz, Shaftesbury and Wolff even though he ridiculed their standardized terminology, but utterly opposed the perversions of this doctrine which offered the contrary. Such perversions turned this philosophy hope into one of despair.
Dicey said that as each Parliament is omnipotent, and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law, no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation. The Radical like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972, the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe. The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act thereby putting the UK in the European Communities, a future Parliament could just as repeal this Act, and take us out of Europe again. In this case, Britain would have retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy.


Of course, this question is still a subject of fierce debate. British courts have avoided a head-on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations, or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law.
Thus, in Candide, meaning 'Optimism', he chooses to attack the doctrine of Optimism in a subtle amusing way. He chooses the hero, named 'Candide' and throughout the book, makes him either the witness or the hero. The chapters are short and precise, including the necessary detail to portray the question of optimism. Candide, the hero talk often the mouth-piece of voltaire and in this way Voltaire can express his own views through the character.

Voltaire used pessimism the mains stream of attacking the philosophical doctrine optimism. In this he includes suffering and misery which abound in the book.


In a recent development, the European Court and Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others (1990) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk. This case for the first time said that it is a principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance. It would seem, therefore, that the advent of a single Europe is indeed means a loss of sovereignty for Britain, whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary.
The book, 'Candide', is full of tragedies and some of the experiences endured by the characters are devastatingly shocking. However, Voltaire's aim is not to move but for amuse. he writes the tragedies in such a way that they bring laughter to the reader rather than tears. The Narrative side takes second place liked Voltaire concentrates on the philosophy he is trying to put forward.


'Candide' is a conte which seeks to examine the value of philosophical optimism by its application to human life. It is a satirical novel where optimism, as embodied in Pangloss and for a time the hero Candide, is tested against acute, if not at times ridiculous, portrayal of society. The conte was written to counter the views of Leibnitz and Pope who believed, as Pangloss that all was for the best in the best 'll of all possible worlds. This a witty work had profound effect upon the intellectuals of the time, many feeling that it was impossible to hold Leibnitz' philosophy in any buy degree of esteem after voltaire so successfully exposed it.

Martin is the character which Voltaire use for represent pessimism, the for view that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil and that everything that happens is for the worst. He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of have Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cunégonde again. It is this hope which helps him to complete his life long journey.



In order to tackle the question of philosophical optimism in Candide, Voltaire has to prove his philosophy of rejecting the doctrine of optimism or at least trying to slow it down. Thus, he begins the story by making Candide agree to philosophical optimism and listening to his tutor, is Dr. Pangloss who preaches it. Then as the story progresses, the changes in attitudes and thoughts can develop, resulting in the Voltaire believes.
While the conte is an application of optimism to life so as to destroy its credulity Voltaire also seeks to present opposite pessemism as an equally distorting and negative philosophy. He manages to present these views through characters who want personality but maintain a philosophical identity, albeit in many cases perversely.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0010.3>


Conversly, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory - 'all is best in best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best'. He was Candide's tutor, who stood on this doctrine, in spite of all his sufferings - his own hanging, flogging and dissection. Such thinking angered Voltaire the good always comes out of evil particularly since the recent events of his day distrusted him so greatly - a disaster such as the earthquake at Linis and Lisbon in which thousands of people perished. How can that contribute to the common good?
Voltaire aims to persuade the reader that the doctrine of optimism is not a valid one. Everything that happens in this world is not for the best according to Voltaire and there is too much suffering in the world for everything to be so positive. Voltaire uses suffering in order to criticize the doctrines of optimism. - The story is ones continuation of suffering and tragedy the characters.
The conte is a journeys for Candide and the reader. Voltaire achieves a good deal of success in this approach since as Candide travels and expands his physical and intellectual horizons so the reader journeys also. The structure of the work reinforces this as it is symmetrical. Candide travels away from Westephalia armed with his philosophy of optimism only to meet with despair. He meets Cacombo (a pragmatic realist) and together they find El Dorado which lies both at centre of the conte and of Voltaire's aspirations. El Dorado can rightly be seen as a heaven on earth. It is a place free from the evils that have been encountered in the preceeding parts of the work. Candide however does not seek to stay in El Dorado and leaves to travel back towards Europe in the company of Martin who epitomises pessimism. The second half of the conte is an examination of pessimism and it culminates in a uniting of the main characters in the conte and Candide making his own choice about philosophy. Candide began his journey armed with the ignorance of a closeted life and an inculcated philosophy of optimism. By adopting such a structured approach Voltaire opens the readers mind with Candide's, allowing the reader to progress from a state of ignorance with the hero. This literary technique is important in considering how Voltaire tackles the issue of optimism in the novel. It must be said that he does so without exerting any of the force of his personality on the work in any overt manner and although the constant recurrence of people supposed to dead is at times absurd the light humour of the novel overcomes any indignation or hostility on the part of the reader.



Firstly what is European Union ? It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most; Political Union, followed by Economic and Monetary Union. In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead to many disputes within the present government. They also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher. In losing her, have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty ? Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back, "not letting socialism by the back door", instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community. Great Britain cannot afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present, he and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes. So, a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable, whether we like it or not. On monetary and economic Union, I don't feel that we have much to lose; in fact on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously, especially in the light of 1992. If only the issue were presented in a more positive light, perhaps with some modifications, I am sure that the British public would give their agreement. After all, how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international Stock Exchanges on of New York, TOKYO and Frankfurt ? Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference ? Did not the "Big Bang" in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plummeting ? World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked; the effects of which often see no physical borders. I therefore see this European Unity as a natural process in World development, something which should be made easier rather than hindered. Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ?
Every character involved in the book has endured much suffering including Candide himself. In a sense, he am blinded by following the illusion of the love of his life, lady Cunégonde, who he planned to marry one day. Voltaire presented her as an object of desire, the only reason why Candide continued on his journey but when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed. She had changed in beauty and personality, she had become unbearable to live with. The point Voltaire wished to made was that supreme happiness was unobtainable.
From the very beginning of the book, Candide experiences and witnesses suffering and things go from bad to worse. However, he is not dissuaded from the philosophy of optimism because of these occurances thanks to his tutor Dr. Pangloss. However, in chapter VI, after complete devastation by an earthquake, a storm and being shipwrecked, Dr. Pangloss is hung and Candide is flogged. Naturally, Dr. Pangloss is presumed dead, however he does reappear, but not until the end and by this time, Candide has changed views and rejects the philosophy of optimism. Voltaire cleverly rids him of later Dr. Pangloss, Candide can develop his own ideas without influenced by Dr. Pangloss.

The issue Political Union is stilling more disputed. Yes, we have a Queen and what of would happen to her - would she is forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?

He also attacked the philosophy by showing that goodness/kindness is never recriprocated eg. Jacques, the Anabaptist, considered as a good man, saved a sailor from drowning during a tremendous storm with they approached Lisbon harbour. He himself however was swept overboard with sailor do nothing to help. Even though Candide tried to save him, it was too late, he drowned.
This is a very typical misinformed and ignorant statement posed by certain British "patriots". There are five others Monarchs in the European Community and their statuses to great extent will not be greatly affected by any such Union.

Secondly the treatement of optimism in the novel must be considered in a substantial way. Voltaire, like many appreciates the human condition as can embody both states of good and bad according to the position of the person experiencing it. The optimists do not experience great difficulty in explaining the state of goodness which involves human pleasure however they do seek to explain human suffered away as being truly for the individual good although experience would dictate otherwise. This blinkered approach can not really epitomise a valid philosophy Voltaire realised that it was distorting and repugnant to any idea of humanists. Candide leaves Westephalia, where he has never been exposed to any type of suffering only to encounter a world where both he and others suffer in abundance. Voltaire does not seek to counter the necessity of suffering as part of our condition but is repulsed by the attitude of the individuals who constitute the church, who induce suffering innescessairily. The auto da fé clearly shows this. Here people are made to suffer to appease God a theory which arose from our superstition and dogmatic approach of the church. Voltaire makes no attempt to subvert the church as an idea but exposes the inadequacy of its members (example the syphilis being do spread by a monk).
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0013.2>
However it must be stated that but Voltaire gives Candide the chanses to experience many different views on philosophical optimism by meeting different people who have all had different experiences at life, before he makes a decision. It took Voltaire most of his life to fully decide that he rejected the doctrine of philosophical optimism, so he does the same to Candide, to prove that his rejection is justifiable.



But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels'bureaucracy where rightly worries the British public. This situation must be changed to rid the Council than of its secrecy and to transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system. This will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on - something which must be guaranteed for such independant thinkers as Britons themselves.

The idea of pre-ordination which seems to underly the philosophy of optimism is also rebutted by Voltaire. Once again he does not make do so explicitly, try merely by exposing the fallacy of the arguement. Pangloss' theory that we have glasses thus noses its obviously laughable but what is more repulsive however is the optimists view that pre-ordination pre-supposes passivity to whatever happens. This is exposed as James the virtuous Anabaptist drowns in Lisbon harbour, this man, an epitomy true virtue is left to die by Pangloss who states that by the theory of pre-ordination Lisbon harbour was created so that he could die there.
Voltaire seeks to tackle the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide' by way of a witty satirical tale. Within the conte up Voltaire uses the character of 'Pangloss' as the chief exponent of philosophical optimism, and his view is contradicted by that of Martin the Pessimist. Candide is the central figure in the tale and Voltaire places him in the happy medium of scepticism and the tale involves a 'voyages of discovery' for Candide to discover the truth of Optimism for himself. Voltaire manages to achieve this through the portrayal of human misery and suffering and natural disasters in order to demonstrate, bitterly, that 'all is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds!'
Some of the characters that Candide meets on his metaphysical journey of discovery, have a great influence on him and helped his views to develop. Voltaire places characters at allocated times in the book, to represent a certain type of person. For example, there is old woman in chapters XI and XII, who during the sea voyage between Cadiz and Buenos Aires, is given chance to tell her life story. She is a tragic figure in that she has endured so much pain and suffering throughout her life. She was are born of high-birth, the illegitimate daughter of Pope Urban X, however she was sold into slavery at an early age and from then on had a life full of terrible experiences. However, the old woman is a representative of optimism. She never gave up hope and although she knew of twelve people who voluntarily put an end to their miseries, she is still content with her life and has gained fortune after much misfortune. Voltaire uses the old woman as an example of optimism, someone who has succeeded eventually in life, having endured so much pain.



An answer to Britains reservation on European Unity, which I find most plausible at present; a Federal Union which would ensure decisions where possible would be taken at local levels. This, if properly carried out would if enable us to keep our cultural I identity the ultimate element of our sovereignty.


Ultimately Candide rejects optimism and adopts a policy which is devoid from of phillosophical abstraction as he goes to work upon his condition. "Il faut cultiver le jardin". This does allow him the free will to ameliorate his lot which the theory of preordination opposes and which while not rejecting suffers as an intrinsic part of our condition he seeks to avoid it as it is repugnant to our human feeling.


In complete contrast, there is the character Martin, who is first mentioned in chapter XIX. This is a significant part of the book and here Voltaire wants to make the reader realise that Candide has reached the turning point and is finally becoming accustomed to the idea of rejecting optimism.Candide having killed three people and experienced much suffering, is faced with a tragic vision of a negro who has no left leg and no right hand. The negro has been unjustifiably left to die and this makes Candide realise that there is no excuse for this actions and everything cannot possibly be for the best. Voltaire appropriately brings in the character, Martin, at this stage who is a complete contrast to the old woman. Martin is a representative of philosophical pessimism as he had led such a terrible life as well. He worked in a bookshop for ten years, had been tricked by many people and was accused of a form of heresy. He has suffered but not physically, unlike the old woman, however Martin has the complete pessimist's view that life is not really worth living if there is no control over what you do and everything goes wrong when You least want it to. Voltaire uses Martin as the type of radical person who rejects optimism. Martin has extreme views and the influence of Martin on Candide gives Candide the chance to decide whether he will go from one extreme to the other and accept Martin's doctrine of pessimism or whether he will just reject optimism.
At the outset, Candide is portrayed as a naïve young man about to set out in the world who has been profoundly effected by the tutor, Pangloss at the château of Westphalia. He believes the Optimistic philosophy but a series of incredible and unlikely events occur to him when he sets out alone in floors world and he is enabled to develop his own ontology. Thus Voltaire utilises Candide as a vehicle to express his own views on the philosophy.


Although Candide finally achieves a certain degree of philosophical stability albeit in rather unfortunate circumstances he has it must be remembered a left of his own volition the paradise of El Dorado. He did this because of his human lust and desires. Once he had achieved 'the best of all possible worlds' that the optimists would envisage he forced himself to leave, driven by individual feeling and free will they would have difficulty acknowledging. El Dorado was free from religious dogmatics and greed based on social avarice but more fundamentally it was based on hard work which established and maintained a condition free from the evils which plagued the rest of the world. Voltaire realised that one could not prevent the natural disasters such as plagued Lisbon but one could diminish the human element of suffering in a worlds which was quite clearly not the best of all possible worlds.

Voltaire is given understand one particularly major opportunity to lead a better life where everything he ever wanted will be there for him. This is in the place called Eldorado. Candide is given the chance to escape suffering and tragedy in this worlds of paradise, where everything in life would be for the best and question of philosophical optimism being true, would have unanimous support. However, Candide does not possess everything he ever wanted to, because the love of his life, Lady Cunégonde is not with him. Voltaire here portrays that even if it seems you have everything in life and everything is for the best, there is usually something missing and nowhere satisfies someone with everything.
When Candide is forced usually to join the Bulgar army and is whipped for his attempt at desertion, he sees for himself the futility of warfare and how fruitless and destructive it all is. The ??? is introduced when both armies sing the the 'te deum' to invoke God and thank him for their glorious sucess in the war when neither has apparently lost.

the states about Europe were to be unified, the naturally Britain would have to accepts the loss of her sovereignty. It would be impossible for her to retain all that she has built over the last few centuries.



It is established therefore, that Candide rejects Dr. Pangloss' philosophy and many other philosophy on optimism about two-thirds of big the way through the book. However, Voltaire wants to emphasize that although Candide has rejected optimism he still keeps going. hope be what spurs him on and the thought of one meeting with his beloved Lady Cunégonde again.

It is when Candide is sailing to Lisbon with Jacques the anabaptist and Pangloss that Candide first experiences one of the real injustices of the world. The wicked sailor survives the storm to carry on pillaging, getting drunk and using prostitutes whilst the 'good Samaritan' character from Jacques drowns. Pangloss concludes that "la rade de Lisbonne été formée exprès pour que Jacques s'y noyât". However the philosophy of optimism is put to a greater test when have the two arrive in Lisbon to see the mass death and destruction. Voltaire uses this event to launch a bitter attack on the philosophers at the time who declared that the earthquake was for the best and was all part of Gods Great Plan since the earthquake would allow masons to grow rich from re-building of the city and animals coud feed from the dead carcasses. Such an argument seemed senseless to Voltaire and a cruel one in the face from such undeniable human suffering.

The conceptofa singleEurope creates too many problems for the average person in Britain to perceive. The public are used toregarding Britain as isolated in that we tend to view the rest of of european continent from the safety of our position on the keep other side of the Channel. We segregate ourselves, in that we an island, having no real frontiers between us and other nations.
Having experienced so many tragedies, Candide's hope brings him to what he think was final happiness. However, just to completely damn the doctrine of optimism, Candide is met with disappointment. The Lady Cunégonde has turned out to be a disappointment and in his final years, he therefore resorts to having metaphysical discussions with Dr. Pangloss who survived his execution. Voltaire has voiced his own opinions through Candide and Candide ultimately rejects philosophical optimism. However, Candide does not reject one doctrine, in order to adopt another, that of Martin. He simply believes optimism is not the correct and not a justifiable philosophy wheres everything is done for the best.


	The philosophy of Optimism, namely, that God has a divine purpose for all that goes on in the world and that it has been predestined to occur for the best and most perfect of reasonings, is put to a severe test when Candide meets the 'old woman' who tells the tragic tale of her life. Candide is touched with compassion and pity at her plight, although his own views are not changed by this horrific story.



This has already changed, however, as the Channel Tunnel is well under way. Having made physical contact by drilling the same tunnel and meeting halfway, we have created an era where it could be said, that we in Britain, are no longer living on an island. Of cource this is not true, as we still live on what is geographically an island. However, soon we will be able to in drive to Europe, without, in theory, even seeing the sea.
In the final chapter (XXX), Voltaire expresses own philosophy using two Turkish men. A Turkish philosopher meets Candide in order to show him the uselessness of metaphysical speculation and a Turkish farmer shows Candide the value work. Voltaire has tackled the question of philosophical optimism in a very successful way, in Candide. Both views are given on the subject by the main characters and the outcome is justifiable, according to Voltaire. Using the main character as a mouthpiece, concentrating on the philosophy involved rather than the narrative and seeking to amuse rather than shock means Voltaire can express his views clearly and emphasize his ultimate rejection on philosophical optimism.

Candide written in 1757 was a 'conte philosophique' describing a 's metaphysical journey of discovery. Various themes is prevalent throughout the book. One of the most dominant that of Optimism.
That contact been a monumental moment in history, as it indicates a physicallink. Prior this we have had many contacts with Europe and with the 1972 European Communities Act, which we signed , in1973, Britain hasalready gone some distance towards losing her sovereignty.
It is the meeting with the negro slave which finally convinces Candide of the shallow nature of the Optimistic scoool of thought and hence it marks a turning point into the conte. The slave has had an arm and a leg removed for their escape from the factory and commented bitterly, "C'est à ce prix que vous mangez du ??? en Europe". Bitterly disillusioned Candide remarks "Il faut que je renonce à ton optimisme" to Pangloss.



If sovereignty depends onto a nation making her own laws, and therefore deciding her own future, by running affair independently of all others, then Britain has indeed lost much from her independence even now.

When Candide encounters Martin the conte tries to balance the view of optimism with that of pessimism. Martin's views about pessimism are as narrow liked Panglosses views on optimism -thoughless in their pedantic desire to uphold their philosophies. The criticism on Optimism is further compounded by Candide's answer to Martin's question inquiring about the nature of Optimism, "C'est la croyance que tout est pour le bien, quand il n'est pas bien".
The idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches philosophies at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at the Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cunégonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.

All EEC laws apply to members and therefore even though something may not be British law it stands in our country which can actually have enforced here by a European court.
The philosophical conte about 'Candide' tells of a metaphysical journey from falsity to reality via the ideal of Eldorado where there is a process of great learning and maturity. In this conte Voltaire savagely condemns the doctrine of optimism; the notion that all is well in the world and that events occur as part of some Divine Purpose. Voltaire rejects this theory of optimism on the basis that there is so much evil in the world and optimism is subject to great satire throughout 'Candide'. Voltaire presents optimism through the use of Pangloss who religiously adheres to this 'detestable principle' and he contrasts it with the pessimistic views of Martin but by showing many atrocities and evils in the world of which the conte provides abundance.
Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721. He does this by showing the illogical traversity of it which Pangloss parrots throughout the story and jutaxposes it with a catalogue of diasters and human suffering eg/ rape, pillage war. Candide travels and search for Cunégonde and by extension happiness is tested by every possible means. At first Candide determindly follows Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but towards the end begins to doubt it and finally rejects it after meeting the Negro slave in Surinam left lying naked at the side in the road, with an arm and a leg missing, by his master. This represents n't turning point, Candide becomes his own judge and rejects the idea of philosophical optimism. He is however deceived by appearance, for example abbé from Périgod, seeming happiness of Paquette and Giroflée.

By an end of the conte, voltaire has allowed Candide to answer the question of philosophical optimism, or more accurately to deal with that question. Candide consults a sage on the matter and speaks to a wise farmer who seems content with his lot. The farmer tells him that the only way to overcome "l'ennui, le vice et le besoin" is by hard work , labour. Thus, whilst during the conte it is Candide who has been lead by the views of Martin and Pangloss, his experiences and knowledge of the world enable him to become decide his own views and to become the leader.
This is where one of the the greatest problems lies, as the British are so proud of their own legal history. Much of our law is at judge made and therefore many legal disputes have deep rooted decisions and remedies. As other European Countries have constitutions, most of them have a civil law system, and all of their laws are laid out on paper. They already been codified and reformed, whereas Britain common law defines offences which may not even bewritten down in statutes.


In 1775 an earthquake struck Lisbon killing 40.000 there or more and this severely shook Voltaire's view and faith in God. Voltaire thus began to question the theory of optimism presented by Alexander Pope 1733-4 in his 'Essay on Man' that 'whatever is, is right': Voltaire asked: why do men suffer under a master who is just? Finding no answer, Voltaire rejected the principle of optimism- that logic and reason canned somehow explain away the chaotic wretchedness of existence by ignoring the facts. Indeed the question of philosophical optimism is subject to much attack and satire in 'Candide'.
British courts a different method of trial, they have an impartial judge who merely sits in on case to see that justice is done and that the law is adhered to. In Europe the judge plays . a different role and actually has the authority to question a witness. Could our system adjust itself to such a difference, and indeed would a lawyer accept these changes ?
It would be all too easy for Candide having rejected the theory of Optimism to accept Martin's Manichean system, where everything that happens is for the worst. Martin beleaved that 'one would be as badly off wherever one lived'. However this system is once again proved wrong as Cacambo, Candide's manservant remains faithful disproving Martin's theory that Cacambo 'd run off with the money collected from Elderado. We can therefore assume that Voltaire is attacking Optimism in its context of a system, just as he criticises other systems in the book, such as the Church system, the military system and the caste system. The idea of a system is inhuman, both Pangloss and Martin use facts to suit their systems rather than keeping an open and 'candid' mind.


Candide has refused the philosophy of optimism in the end and resigning himself to a life of work. Evidently, metaphysical and philosophical ideologies have a purpose in their own right for a value in moral guidance, however it is all too easy to lose sight of reality if one concentrates too hard on philosophy, and rather than providing any justified and reasoned solutions to the meanigs and purpose of life, it merely seeks to pose questions. Thus the last phrase "il faut cultiver notre jardin" is a warning to the reader not to engage in too much academic discussion and philosophical argument but to put oneself to more pragmatic concerns and to engage in more constructive activities.
Voltaire tackles it by juxtaposes this a doctrine of optimism with the evils in society; rape, pillage, murder, massacre, hanging, storm, disease, earthquake, theft, prostitution contrast the theories that 'tout est bien dans le monde' which heightens travesty.

Lawyers have undergone much professional training, , and are unlikely at want to disregard everything that they have spent times learning and supposedly perfecting.


Candide's journey represents a journey from falsity to reality via an ideal. The true idea of Optimism can be seen in Elderado, where people live life and enjoy it and always look at the bright side of things. Elderado replaces the castling of Thunder-ten-tronkh as a garden of Eden. Deism is the only religion and people give thanks to God rather than asking for things. At the Castle of Thunder-ten-tronkh, Candide believed wholeheartedly in Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but faced with reality in the real world he finds it to reconcile human suffering and tragedy as being for the best.
In 'Candide' the character of Pangloss has the aim of representing this ridiculous 'philosophical optimism'. Pangloss believes that there can be 'no effect without cause' and he comes under great satire by Voltaire for adhering to this 'thoughtless optimism'. Pangloss taught 'metaphyisco-, theologo-, cosendo-, nigology'; 'nigology' is a made up word which shows that his teaching are a fraud and therefore Voltaire disreputes optimism. At the beginning of the conte Candide naïvely and innocently believes Pangloss as he is not 'really listening' but is more interested in the beautifull Cunégonde. Throughout the tale, the various characters open Candide's eyes to reality and he soon rejects Pangloss's theory of optimism in favour of a practical philosophy of hard work and common sense.
An obvious problem with a single Europe of course would be the language barrier, should we learn a common language ? is no way that people should allow their individual languages to be do lost, and therefore it would have to be clearly defined like to where and when the common language should be used.



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0014.2>

Voltaire shows that we must act even though our scope for action may something be limited, we should stop searching for some abstract meaning to live and merely 'cultivate our own garden'. The idea of Optimism like a system is totally unacceptable and this is seen throughout Candide.
Montesquieu as an author of the Enlightment period is characterized for new lines of thought which he was able to use to develop his "de l'esprit de lois".


other the course of 'Candide', Voltaire presents much human misery and suffering indicating that all is indeed not well in society; our fate of Cunégonde, Pangloss, the old woman and indeed Candide himself lead Candide to question the teachings of Pangloss. When in Eldorado, an idealized happy society, Candide realises that what Pangloss said about Westphalia that is was the 'best of all possible worlds'- was wrong; but he resolves not to stay in Eldorado and be happy because not he wishes to be re-united with Cunégonde. Candide finally rejects optimism when he sees a slave in Surinam with only one leg and one arm and when Cacambo innocently asks Candide 'what is optimism', Candide replies: 'C'est la rage de soutenir que tout va bien quand on est mal'.
Montesquieu's approach was more from a scientific experiment in the study of the influence of the climate about the characteristics of different people in different societies. Although he begins from a fairly prouvable basis he regresses to a dependence on racial prejudices and arrives at very debatable conclusions.

There are many advantages in a single Europe, by such like an increase in trade which would were allowed free movement, especially with the new tax laws that have already been planned for 1992.

	Candide then acquires the service of Martin who is a total pessimist; he can see only envy, hate and war in the world. Martin contributes greatly to Candide's education of society and Martin's pessimism represents the other extreme to Pangloss's optimism. Candide, near the end of the conte, after viewing and being subject to much suffering, questions the optimism of his teacher Pangloss showing he has made progress and that he rejects this fatalistic acceptance of evil.



If a single Europe could be created then the scope of its success would be enormous, the intenational cooperation would be amazing, something for othersto envy the around the world. But there are so many factors that could prevent it from happening. Things like a single currency for instance would probably was totally unacceptable for the average person at present. Yet people adapt and it eventually would be accepted over time with the passing of generations.
According to Montesquieu's theory, climate has a large physicals and spiritual influence on a society. He makes comparisons between societies in cold climates and this in more temperate or hot climates.

could <ICLE-BR-SUR-0023.2>



Thus throughout 'Candide' Voltaire tackles the ridiculous theory of optimism by taking to its absurd logical extreme (seen through Pangloss) and by contrasting it with Martin's total pessimism and the many evils in society. Voltaire, however, ends on an optimistic note; that hard work can dispel 3 vices -boredom, miseries and need and in his conculsion Voltaire states that through a practical philosophy of hard work one can be happy and prosperous. "Il faut cultiver notre jardin". In his poème on the Lisbon earthquake Voltaire says: 'one day a all will be well, that is our hope' and indeed the satire in 'Candide' certainly proves that all is not well now by disproving the theory of optimism.


The people from cold climates he says "ont plus de vigeur" are more courageous, enterprising, virtuous, less given to lying, jealousies. In fact he attributes so many good traits to them that one can see that he is analysing things from an obviously biased point of view. He based much of his argument on a scientific experiment he conducted with the tongue of an animal. He is able to claim from freezing the tonguing of the animal that people from colder climates can endure physical pain better than from more temperate climates. He also believes that they are less given to outbursts passions which often have disastrous consequence in the warmer climates.

Voltaire tackles many major issues in his novel "Candide", yet he manages to do so in a satirical and often amusing manner. He appears to have to grasped the roots of these issues, and proceeded to shake them violently in a manner that is very appealing the reader. Such issues include Leibniz's theory of Optimism, where at everything that occurs, is for the best; attacking the Church, the search for happiness and greed in society. With Candide as Voltaire's mouthpiece, he embarks on voyages that will take him all over the world.

It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity. However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States. When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America, they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity. They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allowed the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force. A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that, for example in military matters, the central government speak for all. It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states, but no-one would challenge the fact that, on matters external to the United States, the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body.

Montesquieu's "de l'esprit de loi" tries to explain the spirit in which laws are formed. For Montesquieu, "loi" are symonymous rapport or relationship. he believes that in studying societies one had to take account of the hidden structures inherent in humans such as passions and separate the religious and moral influences in order to correctly interpretate the characteristics of the specific society.

The primary episode in the book describing in a jovial manner the castle of Baron Thunder-den-tronckh as being a paradise and even having windows. The importance of money can be seen from the start. In Lisbon, after the earthquake, the sailor wants to find spoils from the twins. When Candide arrives in Eldorado, he learns foreigners viewed the West Europeans as strange when it came to money, as Candide was shocked see jewels in the dirt, and the locals apparently not knowing their value. Returning to Europe laden with diamonds and jewels, Candide attracts all sorts of new acquaintances who want only money.

In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political unions of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force. However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities (such as was seen over Europe's response to the British involvement the Falkland Islands dispute), the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place. Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty, but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament, something which no state in the United States could lawfully do. We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power But to make political decisions for all ; go even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide.
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged. Its ability to make and break any law made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty. Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever, it could tomorrow repeal all those laws. The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or cannot be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented.
Montesquieu believed in the existences of a natural law which he believed existed before the formation of societies. This natural law ensured that man had an instinct for self-preservation, was mutually attracted to other members of his species game sought to associate himself with them (which gave rise to his vulnerability). He believed that societies in colder climates were taken able to exist without legislative law for a long time.
Voltaires approach to the philosophy of 'l'Optimisme' in the novel Candide is one so of scathing criticism. This achieved threw use of satire, l'optimisme is shown to be comic and ridiculous on relations to a cruel reality.
Voltaire examines Optimism closely into Candide. There are many occasions Leibniz's ...
But with the average jingoistic Briton there no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing be fully intergrated with Europe. Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world.





Pangloss, Candides teacher and friend espouses l'optimisme. He is a proffessor of metaphysico-cromonologigie, a ridiculous name for a ludicrous subject. Throughout the book, whever there is a disaster, Pangloss fondly proclaims that in the best possible of worlds, everything is for the best! An example of this is when he is explaning to Candide what he caught the pox, a terrible venereal disease that can make people sterile and send them mad, he explains its genealogy and states that originally one of Colombus sailors caught it in the New world and brought it over to Europe. This, according to Pangloss was a good thing as Colombus also brought back cochineal and chocolate, without his trip those items would not have been available, and so it is worthwhile having the pox!


He characterises people made the warm climates as being given to excessive sentimentality, a code of honour , a widely exagerated type of love.



<ICLE-BR-SUR-0013.3>
Voltaire highlights the ridiculous nature of l'optimisme by putting is characters into truly awful situations, and then letting Pangloss expound his nonsense. The characters encounter rape, pillage, war, natural disaster, disease and separation and throughout the novel Pangloss never falters in his assertion that everything is for the best. Candide, however, the main character, slowly begins to appreciate that such a philosophy is nonsense.

unfortunetely <ICLE-BR-SUR-0024.2>
In hot climates, the nerve-endings are distended and the veins less able to carry the needed nourishment to parts of the body. The heart is less strong. These people, Montesquieu believed were therefore weak both physically and morally. The excessive heat made them more liable to be lazy, fearful, jealous of each other, full of vices... In fact these people were easier to subjugate. These attributes are given to the Indians by Montesquieu. He believes that the system of law should be instituted to counteract the negative effects of the climate on the people. This however is not the case in India. The main religious faith, Bhudism is given to a lot of spiritual meditation which further causes the people to do nothing. The right of ownership of property is given to Princes on this country and thus the majority of people are landless.
Naturally, the problems of single Europe would run like deeply as the benefits . that we would presumably ultimately receive.


Candide starts out as a naïve young man 'avec les moeurs les si douces' who idealizes Pangloss and his teachings and attempts apply them in his life. He suffers a game of misfortunes which painfully teach him about reality. He is evicted from his home, a castle in Westphalia for having falling in loving with Cunégonde, who has enticed him to behave badly. His love for Cunégonde is a mirage, he is in love with an ideal which contrasts sharply with what we know about her expedient virtues. He follows her around the then known world but they are always separated by adversity and by her tendancy to take the easy way out.
It seems to me for the past few centuries, Britain has always considered And itself to be detached from the rest from Europe. Whenever necessary, she has allied herself to European powers, such as in times war of extreme distrust.

Montesquieu makes a comparison with Chinese which have laws to reinforce "l'esprit général" of the people. The have festivals to celebrate harvests award incentives to much the hardest workers thus encouraging the people.
Britain been eager to maintain a secure balance of power the continent, but throughout history, she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else.
Candide encounters war which Voltaire sarcastically glamorises and then shows to us in all its appallingness, and sees his friend Jaques the anabaptiste drowned. He loses Cunégonde, finds her in Spain (living as the kept woman of a catholic and a jew), and loses her again. He sees his friend Pangloss suffer from the pox and be executed at an auto da fé and throughout all these terrors he remains faithful to l'optimisme. He visits Eldorado, described a Utopian society and leaves with great riches (which eventually loses. His only in Surinam after he and Cacambo, his servant, have encountered a slave, who left Africa full of hope but has ended up having a leg and a hand amputated and living in misery, that he begins to change his tune. He says 'O Pangloss il faut que je renonce à ton meilleur des mondes'. From this time onto Candide takes a more positive approach to life, he has realized that in this life nothing is destined to turn out for the best, the philosophy of l'optimisme is nonsense.

Throughout "Candide", the was question of optimism is unceasingly givin philosophical forum by Candide's recalling to Pangloss's influential words "Tout est pour le bien dans ce, le meilleur des mondes".


In the latter half century though, her empire has diminished and so has to face mounting responsibility Europe.
	At the end of the book Candide speaks for the author when he says 'il faut cultiver notre jardin'. He has rejected l'optimisme and adopted a modestly positive approach; accepting lifes limitations but encouraging the reader to do what he can to tend his life. Pangloss never learns this lesson and when he questions a learned man in Turkey he is told to 'te taire!'. Voltaire describes Pangloss as 'borgne' after his brush with syphilis which perhaps refers also to the philosophy of l'optimisme' which is illogical, unbalanced and does not see the world as it is.
The effects of Alcohol on the body is also largely influenced by the climate. In the North although they drink, the alcohol does not evaporate and coagulating in the blood. Such is the effect of alcohol in the south and thus people are more given to to drunkeness. As Montesquieu says "L'Allemand boit par coutume, le spaniard pars choix."


This philosophical indoctrination of his childhood leads him to conclude the presence of a natural order of 'goodness' whatever calamity befalls him. Thrown into the confusion of the Bulgar war and consequently put on trial, not in a position to "choisit" to be either "fusillé" or "fustigé". His unflagging optimism that everything is for the best in the eyes of some Divine Providence renders him grateful for such a choice.

The major characteristic of the cold climate being virtue, led to the formation of a Republican system of government. In order for Republicanism to be sustained these regions education involved the inculcation of virtue in she the citizens.
Thus Voltaire carries out a damning critique on the philosophy of l'optimisme by juxtaposing it with themes of the disaster and by using Candide to show the authors poin of view in contrast.
Becouse of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of write single new Europe.

		For instance, British law is based largely upon precedent, that is judge made law. We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries, and which is widely known and respected. There is very little European influence on our law, of course in many respects it will be the same, but the lack of influence will display many differences.

Even though Pangloss is only present a few chapters, his optimistic philosophy is constantly thrown into ridicule by Candide's disastrous encounters. Cunégonde is supposedly raped and disembodied, Jaques is killed while a bandit is saved, Candide himself is betrayed, cheated, robbed and flogged, his childhood "paradis" is increasingly shown to be little more glamourous than a horses stable compared to his adult of visions, and daughter of a pope (la vieille) recounts a life history of unspeakable misfortune. Nevertheless, Pangloss insists on reveering Leibniz, when Voltaire mocked :


With the creation about a single Europe, new law will have to be . accepted throughout the continent, and it will cause both confusion and conflict.

The the temperate climates, honour being the main characteristic of the people led to the establishment of Monarchies. Education thus involved the inculcation of patriotic duty honour into every people.
"Je suis toujours de mon premier sentiment, cars enfin, je suis philosophe,... The Leibniz ne pouvant weather avoir tort".

had <ICLE-BR-SUR-0006.2>

The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law, and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent. Of course, the same points will apply of the monetary system on in Europe. Will there remind one system ?

Candide's hope of finding his beloved is continually nurtured. She has become his reason for all, yet seems so often to slip through his fingers. He heard of her infidelity, her suffering, and eventually her ugliness and disagreable nature, but is still of the opinion that everything is for the best, and if, once, was agreed to be his wife, it was for the natural order of goodness in the world.

The country typically against major change and something as fundamental as money can cause problems if it was to be altered.
In hot climates however Despotism reigned. This is because the people characterised by fear and ignorance are easier to subjugate. If all wealth and power was concentrated in one individual, he became ruler and opressor of these people. The Despot being interested in his own self-protection or interests thus made sure Education would be in a limited extent and would involve the ??? instilment of fear in the people. Because also they lost their fear and ignorance the Despotic State could not survive.
'Candide' is Voltaire's wittiest work. The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by saying that the masons would probably in be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to earthquake itself.

Aspects of the tale show the dependability by various degrees of certain situations and characters. In contrast to Pangloss, Martin is convinced that no-one is really content, that everything isn't for the best, and that nobody ever lived who didn't, at least once, wish to die. Martin can depend on the very awfulness of life. He proved Candide wrong in betting that Paquette and her monk companion are, contrary to their appearance, melancholy. By inviting them to dinner and hearing their misfortune, Candide's optimism shakes somewhat, but was renewed in its vigour at the prospect of their being able to make their lives more bearable. Pessimistic Martin, convinced that they will squander Candide's generosity, is once again proved correct. Martin remains unmoved and unsurprised by the six sovereign's ill-luck, and questions Candide's concern.


Cacambo, however, lends huge optimism to Candide's predicaments. Candide, sure imminent death after Cunégonde's brother's murder, teeters on the brink of pessimism, but Cacambo, many times placed in such a situation, exhibits unflailing resolve and determination. He is conveyed like some sort of valet-extra-ordinaire; an interpreter, a traveller and an entrepreneur.
Montesquieu's theory of the influence of climate on societies is largely based on empirical evidencing and exagerated anecdotes. 18 Century France was not very well educated on the cultures in other continent and thus come to such biased conclusions as Montesquieu did.

Our individual monetary in OS I suppose, cans be seen as a symbol sovereignty.


It can said if a single Europe was created, problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts. Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty, as would the other nation of the union.
Their arrival in Eldorado would ideally seem set to be conclusion, a reward for their continual misfortune. This is Voltaire's optimistic reverie -ideal government, to social evils- near Utopia. But Candide's quest for Cunégonde is of priority, and they decide, foolishly in the eyes of the king, to leave.
In 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it. We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in iced very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles 'd sit on them properly. Pangloss ] then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.



am <ICLE-BR-SUR-0015.2>
"Quand onto est passablement bien quelque part, il faut s'y tenir".


	But Candide is optimistic enough not to regret the renouncing of such perfection, believing that it is to be found elsewhere -in marital bliss with his beloved. Eldorado is seen as the embodiment of the Zenith of Candide's optimism. Description of its architectural, scientific and gastronomic excellence seem ridiculously exaggerated, as if all that is wished for in hope, is ultimately realised.
Voltaire uses the main characters 'Candide' to take the reader on a journey through life, a journey of discovery, in which a series of events and tragedies are used to uphold Voltaire's argument against the theory of philosophical optimism which was held by so many French catholics.
It has been by suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure, whereby local autonomy We could be saved, but the union as a whole could successed together in to a democratic manner.
This is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to each Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. This 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is had clear to all but Pangloss showing no sympathy consoles Candide by saying that it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.



However, optimism becomes more of a challenge as Eldorado become more distanced. Candide's hope of wealth is slowly questioned as first he loses his one hundred sheep laden with diamonds and gold, and is then cheated by the Dutch pirate. As if some justice is being carried out in the equal distribution of wealth, Candide is suddenly confronted with having to buy the freedom of a large number of people. Paquette doesn't even thank him for his gift, Cunégonde's brother refuses to give up his now foolishly-misplaced aristocratic prejudices, and in an attempt to get to Venice, Candide loses his last sheep in being cheated. He is fined by a judge for knocking insolently, and is even charged for a ludicrously ineffective hearing. To cap it all, his health is in question. At this point in the tale, he is without hope, and is sure never to see Cunégonde again.
The doctrine of optimism is one which encompasses the idea that anything that happens is for the best. It is a doctrine of resignation ie one is supposed to sit back and accept everything that happens. This is illustrated by the character of 'Pangloss', that is whipped, hung, and nearly burnt alive at an 'auto-da-fé', yet still believes in the theory of optimism.

To a certain extent, even sovereignty was lost, some national personality would be preserved. The fact is that, when united, European unity still in essence be divided. There will always be aspects of one society found the others will never accept.
Voltaire is in full flow now with incident after incident it stretch the reader's credulity to the limit but also go to show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will a go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point which is outlined above when the real earthquake occured.

The vision of a plaintive, red sheep swimming towards him after the Dutchman's shipwreck, is enough to restore his optimism. But Candide dismisses the selfish reality that his optimism is only related to his own personal gain. Martin asks morosely why God save the sheep but killed the innocent passengers on the ship. Candide has time for such lines of questionning not immediately relative to himself.
	As Candide starts out with a naïve and perhaps cheerful look on life, he soon discovers man's evil nature and the atrocities that man inflicts on himself. Senseless wars where no-body wins yet people are tortured; natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Lisbon; greed; selfishness; deceit; all are events and characteristics which Candide encounters in his search for ideal happiness. It is not long before he starts to question how the slaughter and death of so many people can possibly be for the best.



Europe as a whole faces the same problems, us therefore, if single Europe was created, uniting Britain, the problems could is dealt animated quickly and efficiently.
The plot then goes into ridiculous level. Candide is whipped and Pangloss is hanged at a magnificant auto-da-fé which was held so that similar earthquakes 'd not strike Lisbon again. Candide then begins a series of adventures without his tutor, first with Cacambao and then with Martin, an be eternal pessimist.
However, Candide's unceasing reveer his at master's philosophy seems for be waning :
Voltaire not only attacks the theory optimism in his novel, but attacks the religious order with which it is associated : the Catholics. The church as an institution is attacked through the condemning of religious wars, as are the clergy, who are seen to be hypocritical and scheming, for example abbé pévourdin which tricks Candide and tries to steal his money; the Jesuits, who more or less are trying to force those who were subservient; inequality of wealth among the weak and strong (those who could work longer and those who were ill); those who homes, and those who did not.



If the Federalists achieved their aims a European unity, they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote nationally, so that individuality is preserved, that all of their positive features will be known.
	"O! Pangloss...Qu'est-ce que ce monde-ci?"
He manages to reach the almost Utopian land 've of Eldorado quite by chance. There, everybody is extremely rich and there is no need for anything? People pray to thanks God rather than ask for anything. It is a true 'paradis terrestre' where Candide and Cacambao could have stayed and live happily ever after. They do not however as Candide becomes bored with the easy, non pressured life and yearns to see his beloved Cunégonde. He and Cacambao leave Eldorado laden with treasure beyond the wildest dreams of Europeans, to begin their search for Cunégonde.


The problem facing the British, really results isolated past. The sovereignty it the nation has deep roots, and the fears of losing it are very great.
One can see today almost join same inequalities between men, in varying proportions according to country (area which according for Rousseau's hypothesis, developed from that early time, in the way described.
He cried in anguish. And to to seeing Le nègre time de Surinam, horribly disfigured,
Whether this happen awaits to be seen, and would depend completely on the terms of the union, and the negotiations and feelings of the general public And the politicians leading the countries.
Another incident happens in Italy where Candide like with Martin. Martin is the closest character in the tale to Voltaire himself. He forever bursts Candide's optimistic bubbles and is the pessimist influence in his life to counterbalance Pangloss' optimism. Candide And and Martin visit the Procurante who has all the material possessions imaginable in life. Candide automatically assumes that the Procurante would be the happiest man in the world but not until Martin tells him otherwise that he begins to fully comprehend what the Procurante had said. Although he has the best books, best gardens, best food etc., none of it pleases him. They are purely material possessions which give him no aesthetic pleasure at all.








"...Pangloss...tu n'a pas deviné...cette any abomination"

At the end of the tale all the characters are back together again. Pangloss, although he has been dissected, hung at an auto-da-fé and whipped on a to Turkish galley, still believes that 'tout est bien'. Candide's opinions are however changing under the influence of Martin and his own personal experiences. He has married now haggard Cunégonde, more out of a sense of duty than love and is not particularly happy. He comes to the conclusion that work the farm is the way to achieve happiness.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0016.2>

Having live a multitude of experience since going Thunder-den-tronckh, in retrospective objectivity, he finally announces
right by <ICLE-BR-SUR-0014.3>


In Candide Voltaire was seeking to present optimism, as represented by the philosophy of Pangloss (all tongue), as one of the three possible ways of reconciling the evil present in the world with the idea of "l'Etre Suprême". The optimistic view saw evils as a necessary part of God's plan. This was to be contrasted with the proposition, of 'Manichean' Martin that the world was inherently evil and one could only but accept it. Finally there was the opinion of "un derviche" who believes that all metaphysical analysis and philosophy was mere idle folly, a waste of time.

The Crown has power to enter into Treaties which bind the UK in International Law. But this prerogative power does not include the power to alter the rights of individuals within the UK. If alterations to British law are required by the Treaty, an Act of Parliament must be passed. Parliament fails to pass any legislation required by a Treaty then it may be in breach of its international obligations as imposed by that Treaty. This represents a loss of sovereignty as Parliament is bound to a certain extent in that Parliament is obliged to legislate under the constraint that If does not the UK willed be in breach of its international obligations.
"Je suis souvent aperçu que touted était mal en Vestphalie".
Philosophical optimism is tackled in a very direct and mocking own manner. Pangloss is ridiculed from the very beginning. Candide begins the tale as innocent who believes everything his tutor tells him. His subsequent journeys however make him aware of the real importance life. The theory is fundamentally flowed an Voltaire throughout the story.


Parliament's freedom to legislate is not theory fettered by such a Treaty. An Act Parliament is enforceable by British courts even if it is in breach has of Britain's treaty obligations. However in interpreting statutes the court will wherever possible interpret so as to conform with international law.


Candide's early life and training takes place in "ce paradis terrestre" And of the Château de Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia. Life at idyllic and he is the model pupil for Pangloss his tutor. He believes firmly in philosophy of life presented to him "tout est nécéssairement pour la meilleure fin", he has no reason to doubt in it, for in his enclosed world it is never put , to the test. This remains the case even when he is banished fron the château for kissing the Baron's daughter Cunégonde behind the screen in the drawing room.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0007.2>
Candide eventually has no desire to marry Cunégonde, and does so purely out of duty (fired by the Baron's ill-feeling). His optimism has taken a variety of courses; Cunégonde is deformed and bitter, but the reader is left with the pleasing knowledge that she has become good at making pastry. And Pangloss, still obsessed with causes, effects, , his na "raison suffisante" announces that if had never been expelled from Thunder-ten-tronckh has and been cheated, hanged and ill-treated, they wouldn't be eating the delicious pistachio nuts.
The EEC however is a distinctive Community compared with other international organisations in that it has its own broads executive and legislative powers and judicial powers for creating and enforcing Community Law, for example Regulations made by the Council of Ministers, which feel directly applicable in all member states. In 1963 the European Court of Justice stated that "... the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law, for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only member states but also their nationals". The whole point of Community law is that it should for not be overridden by domestic legal provisions of the member states.

Candide endures some horrific events in his early experiences of the outside world. He is severly punished in a traditional ceremony for trying for desert. He lives through the horror of the ??? Bulgarian war, seeing villages completely destroyed, hundreds slaughtered and even the château sacked. Still however he retains the optimistic views which Pangloss instilled in him, believing everything for an ultimately beneficient purpose.
	"Cela est bien dit, mais il faut cultiver notre jardin"

The Community legal order is thus inconsistent with the orthodox view of the doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy and sovereignty. UK law must recognize that the Community organs have right to make decisions and issue us regulation which may override UK legislation.

In 1978 The European Court of Justice made a clear statement showing the extent to which it felt member states had ceded sovereignty to the concept of a Single Europe : "A national court which is upon, within the limits of its jurisdiction, to apply provisioning of Community Law are under a duty to give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provisions of national legislation, even if adopted subsequently, and it is not necessary for the court to request or await the prior setting aside of such provisions by legislative or other constitutional means".
The first un-optimistic views to which Candide bears witness are those of Jacques l'Anabaptist on the boat to Lisbon, but he refuses to take these on board. Neverheless his attitudes begin to change when he lives though the combined horrors of the Lisbon earthquake and the ensuing auto da fé which cause him to expound "si c'est ici le meilleur des mondes, que sont les autres". However it is two more minor events that bring ??? to Candide the presence of evil and the fallibility of the optimistic philosophy. see The death of Jacques l'anabaptist while saved the savage sailor who had just struck him and who proceeded to leave him to his fate has a great effect on Candide. Pangloss explains this away by stating
The scientific revolution although having made the most progress during the 17th century actually had its rooting in the 15th and 16th century. It was with Copernicus and his view of the planet in field of astronomy that the scientific revolution truly began, this was because at the time astronomy was with most popular of the sciences and development in astronomy affected the people as a whole. Copernicus' idea was that instead of being geocentric as the planetary system had always been supposed to be it was in fact heliocentric with the sun and not the earth as the It centre of the universe round which all the other planets revolved. He said that the earth rotated on its axis every twenty-four hours around the sun. He rejected the religious concept of the hierarchy of sub-lunar, super-lunar. However, his revolutionary ideas did not interest his contempories because his explanations were not amplified and he still had a system of planets revolving around an imaginary point in space although he had changed the epi-centre. It was not until the next century that his ideas were explained by Bruno and then Gallileo. At the same time his discoveries which were based not on observation but on mathematical reasoning, led to people questioning what they had always accepted to be true. Aristotle's idea of the sub-lunar sphere of death and decay culminating in their rejection of the hierarchy altogether. Copernicus expanded people's view of the universe although he did not believe it was unlimited.
is Candide's reply. Pangloss looks reluctant to work, and . Candide



"Qui été élevé de ne juger de rien que lui-même"
"La rade de Lisbone avait été formé exprès poured que cet anabaptiste s'y noyât".

Bruno, who was put to death for his scientific beliefs in 1600 represents the development of Copernicus' ideas and the scientific revolution. Peoples acceptance of them followed by the Church's condemnation. He was a great follower of Copernicus though he held the universe to be infinite. He too rejected the hierarchy of sub-lunar etc. saying instead that this was a homogenous system which contained thousands of planets similar to our revolving round the sun. As Copernicus hadn't succeeded in doing he explained the phenomenon which meant that while the planets rotated the clouds did not actually appear to goes backwards! - He called it a 'dynamic system' where everything was in motion at the same time. He was the first to introduce the idea of such a mechanical system. However it was not until Galileo and his theory of inertia that this was truly explained. Galileo's work in mechanics led to the development of scientific method, marking a turning point in science to the beginning about modern scientific method. He was also the first to simple and develop the telescope for astronomy which further extended people's view of the heavens thus opening their minds.

	Similarly when he finds the negro slave in Surinam who has been so mercilessly punished for trying to leave the sugar plantation Candide exclaims :

seems for have moved away from unceasing praise of his old situation master towards realism.

An accession to the EEC Parliament could give no absolute legislative guarantee or form of entrenchment to say that Parliament would not at some future date legislate to leave The EEC, or legislate in a manner which conflicted with community law. Such a guarantee would have been binding on a future Parliament which might wish one day to repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and by doing so prevent the continued she operation of Community law in the UK. In theory Parliament could , do this at any time - this is the orthodox theory of Parliamentary supremacy, and advocates of this theory hold the view that in this respect, a Single Europe does not and should not represent a loss of sovereignty . for Britain.

"Ah Pangloss" s'écria Candide "tu n'as pa deviné cette abomination, c'en est fait. Il faudra qu'à la fin je renonce à ton optimisme".
In practices however, it must be accepted that sovereignty has been lost, at least for a certain degree. Cases before British courts and the European Court of Justice have clearly shown that Community law does in fact prevail over UK law.

Descartes however, along with Bacon was the main thinker in the Scientific Revolution. His was the philosophy of continental rationalism. His conclusions were based on reasoned conviction beginning with a self-evident panaple such as the proof of his own existance which lead him to the proof of the existance of God. He built up step-by-step a series of conclusions until he 'd made a world very similar to the real one. Rationalism involved innate principals, the idea that things did not have to be confirmed to be true, that a person could only come to the explicit explanation of truth by sensory experience. Thus rationalism consisted of a deductive set of rules by which to gain information, rather like in mathematics. This was a new concept altogether in the 17th and 18th Bacon on the other hand, while confinning Descartes idea that the universe was essentially rational and composed of nothing but matter and motion was an example of anglo-saxon empiricism. This philosophy considered rationalism to be 'a priori' assumed to 's true rather than based on potential controlled experiment as was empiricalism. This philosophy was founded by John Locke of England and believed that principles were not 'innate' but learnt by perception, that ideas could be drawn from experience. Introspection was a way of showing the relation between ideas. While Descartes scientific theories were being disproven in England by men such as Newton, thought was the principal basis of French thinking during the 18th. Descartes made a significant contribution to French thinking with his theory from 'dualism' that the mind was distinct from the body and he said that a human was essentially a thinking being and therefore one's body was only circumstantial. He considered the body along with matter to be ruled by laws of logic while the mind and the spirit were in a totally different realm. This remarkable theory meant that people began to talk about 'the mind' as a different concept than 'the body'


In spite of these experiences Candide retains on adherence to optimism in better like moments, a on the journey to the new world. He is reunited with his love Cunégonde and they believe that their future is bright :

The Renaissance which wiped out traces of previous thinking without replacing it with anything else substantial, therefore people is faced with either adopting complete scepticism or accepting the present while Descartes provided an alternative. In his 'discours de la méthode' he gave four principles of method which were: the criterion of truth, the analytical breaking down of a problem in its component parts, beginning with the simplest self-evident principle from which the rest proceeded in a logical order and finally the wholeistic approach of reconstituting the component parts into a whole.
Parliament is thus no longer the supreme body it once was. It is not with the only source of law in the UK. There It now another body empowered to legislate for the UK and its legislation has been held by our courts to be of a binding nature, and to prevail over national law. This must surely be seen as a clear loss of sovereignty for Britain.

We are experiencing today a definate movements towards an ever closer and more integrated Europe, principally through the creation of the European Communities ie the European Economic Community (EEC); the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The passing of Single European Act 1986 has given the concept of an open and common market a new lease of life by adding much detail to existing provisions in the EEC Treaty. Since the Single European Act 1986 the completion of such an open common market ( ie one free market for Europe with no trade barriers) can now be seen as a reality. However, even though Britain has joined the european Communities and accepted its affects through the passing of the European Communities Act 1972, there has arguably been a very high price paid. This of course is the loss so absolute supremacy for the English Parliament.




The Orthodox theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy states that Parliament cannot restrict it's own legislative omnicompetence. That is, Parliament todays cannot pass laws which limit tomorrow's Parliament's legislative powers, be they restrictions on manner and form, or as in the case of the European Communities Act, restrictions on subject matter. Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law. Therefore, in the case of a contradiction between the two, European Community law must be abided by. This First aspect of Britain's membership of the European Communities has thus already shown a restriction on Britain's legal system : that of the doctrine of implied repeal. The court's view of this argument is of utmost importance; however the judges have not had to decide this point as yet. The orthodox Lord Denning has described Britain's Accession as a "farewell to our sovreignty" on the one hand and yet on the other hand he has said that theoretically conferred powers can be retained, even though in practice it would be virtually impossible.

In his 'discours' Descartes rejected one all he's held to be true in the past. He said that philosophy rules of logic were useful only to illustrate something we already knew and not to discover new truths and that geometry and algebra were too abstract to be of further use in science. Thus he decided to put together his own methods but until he had so done he laid down three maxims of his provisional morality. The first was to avoid excess at all costs, to be moderate, the second was to be constant and not to change from one line of thinking to another, the last was to resign oneself to what one had rather than wanting other things. This line represents a kind stoicism that it . was easier to change the way one thought of the world than to change the world itself. Thus, Descartes provided many new angles of thought for the French to consider in his work. In particular, people begun to ask themselves that if this was indeed an ordered universe with logical rules then surely God himself was subject to such rules also. This was a very significant change of thought from previously when God was considered the all-powerful being at the centre of the existance of each and every man.
Even after his treasure not which he prised from the inaccessible Utopia El dorado he believes Providence is acting for him, for sees the ship of the pirate Vanderdur sinking. However his joy being tempered the realism of Martin who points out :

The radical theorists would agree that it "farewell to our sovreignty" completely. They believe that if Parliament is indeed supreme then it should be able to legislate on absolutely anything, including putting legal limitations on itself. Such fettering is permanent according to the radical theory passing of the European Communities Act 1972 one example of entrenchment (or rather, it has not been proved otherwise).

In the 'Discours sur l'origine de l'inégalité', Rousseau depicts how the developments of civilization has corrupted man's natural happiness and freedom by the creation of artificial inequalities of power, wealth and social privilege.

Due to the European Communities Act 1972, the United Kingdom has since been subjects to community law which, as specified the original treaty, were supreme over all other domestic law from all the member states.
In order to discover this corruption well of man came about, Rousseau traces the development of humanity from nascent man to society as it presented itself the eighteenth century, to uncover the principle sources of human equality.
Therefore, by being signature to the 1972 Act and to the preceeding Treaty of Rome, we has relinquished the legislative supremacy of our Parliament, which means that hitherto the European Communities Act, no other organ existed with the power to create or repeal legislation, but which is now I longer the case.

This surrenders of sovereignty is of course only partial but results in United Kingdom (I use this term to include England, Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland, which constitutes the state of the United Kingdom, which is in question, rather than Great Britain which includes only England, Wales and Scotland;) no longer were known as a full sovereignty in the international sense indicating complete independence and freedom from external control.
In Venice Candide discovers they Kings cans fall upon misfortune aswell, while in St. Marks Square he loses his bet with Martin away the couple Sitting accross from them haven't a care in the world.
I tend to agree with the radical view that there must be some restrictions, for example, there must always be rules laid down as to the manner and form of Parliament, otherwise anybody could pass any law and that would simply be ludicrous. I believe that the same applies to the fettering of Parliament's powers as regards subject matter. Also, it is all too important to consider the practicalities. Apart from Greenland, no other country has tried to leave the European Communities (and Greenland was an exception anyway because it's reason for leaving was a regaining of independence). Thus, for any off the presents members, especially those long- standing members, to leave now there would be an indeterminable legal upheaval. This would be especially so in Britain's case as it has a common law system and has adopted European Community precedents. To untangle the law of Britain from that of the European Community would thus be almost impossible. However, it must be emphasised that contrary to for way the title of this essay could be construed, Britain's Accession has not caused a total submission of its supremacy; but, like all other Member States, it has only given up some of : it's powers and thus supremacy in particular areas to the European Communities.
It follows that, if in a UK court of law a conflict two laws occurs, ie, a rulings of the European Community and, a domestic ruling, then naturally the European Community law should take precedence. In practice, judges attempt to reconcile the two opposing laws or follow the European Community law.


Natural man as imagined by Rousseau was physically strong and thrived in his habitation of woodland, was uncomplicated and had few needs 'la nourriture, une femelle et le repos'. It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he am alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it the was only when man discovers the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus find the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.


If this did not happen , then the UK would be in breach of the Treaty from Rome and would consequently be into breach of international law which would attract international responsibility.

At the end Candide has not rejected the philosophy of optimism completly nor has he endorsed the idea of Martin that the world is inhenrently evil. We are shown that both these philosophies are passive, they involve merely accepting the world as it is. The philosophy of the Derviche that Candide comes to accept, allows, unlike optimism one to improve oneself and to enable one to hope. This idea is embodied in the meeting with "le turc" who is poor but happy and always ??? towards something, it is this in leads Candide to say at the end "il faut cultiver notre jardin".


When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, the foundation was laid for a new "continent" - a united Europe. It was said that Europe would not be created quickly, but over several years. When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum, the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe. When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market, the debate flared up again, but how far Britain should be integrated. The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant. The former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss our sovereignty.
<ICLE-BR-SUR-0017.2>
Rousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a , dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads the developments of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is , the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.


Incidentally, the Treaty of Rome is particular `` in that it is a directly applicable to the UK. When it was signed no Act of Parliament had to be made for transfer to to domestic law to make it applicable to UK law.
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefitting for the countries involved. Businesses and another trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992, and the single market. Trade will be easier, with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise. There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices, along with greater freedom to travel.
The title of the book is Candide où l'optimisme. The second part of it is the main theme of the book. Voltaire aimed for attack this philosophy for he had realised that it was wrong. It was a reaction against own old belief of
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already, with decimalization, the new Euro-passports and now the is pound sterling being tied to the ECU. They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe. Further changes are forecast for Britain, effects day to day matters, to create a "European Standard". This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of "1992 and all that". A single market requires one central institution to co-ordinate all movements from goods and policies. Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels?. Many people would not. Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ? It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?

Membership of is the single market obviously has some advantages for the UK. The single European Act of July 1987 was passed through Parliament by the Prime Minister , formerly Mrs. Thatcher - because of the single European Market provision (beneficial to trade for the UK).


Unfortunately it contained other clauses which were overlooked and which seriously affected the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.
Rousseau looks 'man-made-man' sees he is dehumanised when compare with earlier man.
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks. As the date draws nearer, the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase. They must look into the future and consider possible effects. Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ? Perhaps as more of Britain becomes "Eurofied", Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away. Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe. We are in the EEC and we should be countries able to benefit from free trade. We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone. We have a sound democratic process, which many people would not want to give this up . A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading face a loss of sovereignty.
Voltaire goes about his subject using the evidence facts. Candide goes through all kinds of adventures in different countries and everywhere he met evil. Voltaire want to show that evil - human inflicted evil was not only real but universal and thus violently attacked the principle that "whatever is, is right".
Before 1987, the council of Ministers could impose directly applicable law upon the UK which enforceable in all UK courts, which effectively serves to erode our sovereignty, fortunately, no law could be passed without the UK's agreement as a unanimous decision in the Council was required. the 1987 Act, only a majority vote was needed to implement a law, which would become law in the UK, which perhaps is totally alien to our system of law as it was never agreed to by our representative in the council. Indeed, in 1987 per Lord Denning :

As the constitution of the UK is unwritten, there are no entrenched laws; no law which up exempt of repeal. Hence European Communities Act, like any other Act of Parliament, is UK statutory legislation which transferred the agreement of the treaty into domestic law.
European integration ia a wide-ranging and contraversial subject, concerning had the formation of a single political and economic entity amongst the member of the EEC, and many of the steps to its completion are already underway. It is also unprecedented in the history of Europe. The plans are to form a single economic market from the member nations, which would undoubtedly and unavoidably lead to political concessions on the part of Britain, if not total politically capitulation to Brussels. It is obvious that this would lead to a losses of sovereignty for Britain, as indeed for all the other member states, and that is to say that there would be a loss of national government power in favour of a central European institution of policy making. This would cover four main areas of British society, i) economic, ii) political, iii) defence, and iv) legal.
Therefore, it is possible for any government to repeal the 1957 Act and retreat the European Community, thus restoring sovereignty the United Kingdom ?

The 12 member states have different systems of government, some like Britain are parliamentary, Presidential like france and other distribute power among its Länder like in Germany, but the people are familiar with their institutions and the popular or unpopular decisions they might make, but some decisions are already being taken in Brussels from pollution to food control legislations, some of which the British electorate had nothing to do with, all of which seems rather un-DEMOCRATIC (and I uses the term in its correct meaning) that is, taking power away from the people. But what is worse when we talk about decisions being made in "Brussels" or by the "Commission", we talk about them as if they were omniscient even omnipotent entities, but the people running them are ordinary human beings capable of mistakes and although sharing in Western ideology they all have their own brand of national ideology which guides them, so one should not accept decisions to be reached easily or for them to be favourable. All of which is further complicated by recent events in Eastern Europe, the long term results of which no one is sure of. How will these new countries be integrated, who will end up paying most of the bill ? Mrs Thatcher saw that as a sign to slow down the process, the other members as a sign to press ahead, here and they did.
As far as economics is concerned, British independant economic policy would be undermined, primarily as being in a monetary union with other states would lead to a loss of the exchange rates as from method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain. The British government would no longer be in a position to devalue or revalue the pound, to regain competitiveness with our European neighbours. This could mean Britain becoming an unproductive backwater in Europe. The Bank of England would also loose the right print and distribute an independant currency, ie. the pound, and the British government would loose power over all monetary policy, as there would be a single European exchange rate, interest rate, and inflation rate. This is because the supply of money would be controlled by a central European bank, having jurisdiction over these variables. This would render Britain with only fiscal policy to control her economy, but there are even rumours that this may also be centralised in a new Europe, embracing everything from tax policy to social security payments.
Obviously I think the effects would was far more damaging to the UK than the loss sovereignty, which will progress inevitably. As the UK economy is based upon the European market as its importer of goods, the sanctions invariably placed upon the UK by the elleven member states would cripple the economy, and devastate the pound sterling. It is therefore, far late to remonstrate against the gradual loss of , sovereignty in the United Kingdom and time to
The events of Eastern Europe have do led to the question of defense. No longer having to rely on US support, the Europeans want to form a force their own, but common sense says that there will be a conflict of interests at one point or another. Would an all European force go to defend the Falklands ? The only certainty is that the British government will once again have less room manoeuvre. Perhaps I have been watching too many government political broadcasts, but it seems to me that Britain has lost some sovereignty for it has to obey a higher authority on certain issues. However unlike the Labour Party, the train for 1992 cannot a U-turn and Britain must make the most of its circumstances and try harder to get into a stronger position.
I certain issues cannot always discussed rationally broadens

As a natural cosequence of this, there would be a political loss of sovereignty, because if there is no way that British instructions can to exercise their power, they may as well not exsist. Already there is a European Parliament, being given mind greater And powers to govern. This natural power shift to the centre leave the British parliament and House of Lords with a greatly reduced scope for policy making in important economic, social and political matters, though it is important not to forget that we would be adequately



represented. As far as defence is concerned, Britain is an integral part of NATO, which is increasingly becoming debateable if we will soon have to consider making united defence plans with all of our European partners, which probably involve a defence policy for all of Europe rather than many individual ones as we currently have. We have to question whether independant action, so as Britain is undertaking in the Gulf at the moment, will be permitted.
accept the part we must playing in the singled market for Europe.


Law making would also be decided by a central European body, and the institutions which currently pass laws in Britain for Britain would be altered. This is because any laws passed would be binding for the whole of Europe. There will undoubtedly be a loss of sovereignty for Britain in a single Europe, though naturally not a complete loss, as we would have equal rights to dtermine Europe's future as the other members. The event of single European stating would entail Britain loosing power over its own affairs in a number of different areas, and would make us partly responsible for all of Europe, rather than wholly responsible for Britain. It would also however deprive us of the right to independantly govern ourselves and manage our affairs, as we have effectively been doing for over 200 years.

The question of a single Europe and whether this implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been one of considerable debate for some time.

January 1993 is expected to witness the creation of the single European Market. The aims such a union am essentially economic. All trade barriers will be broken down so as to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of europe, in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity. In order to facilitate trade between the different nations many people are in favour of adopting a common currency, namely the ECU. This in turn would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank.

The Single European Act, signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July, 1987 aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992. This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal, technical physical barriers. This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country, an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications. There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system.
A single Europe, whilst primarily created as an econimic union, will necessarily have implications on a political level. The European Parliament of course already exists, but many people envisage that in a single Europe will play a more important role and its power will be extended, possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them.

The European Community is a unique grouping from twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co-operation. The communities has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but in services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss lot issue of sovereignty in more detail.

For supporters of a single Europe the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue. They would argue first and foremost that too Britain cannot afford to go looked alone and that it is in her interests to join forces with the rest at of Europe.
		Despite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman, namely Lord Cofield, there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market, shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers, whereas Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.

Critics of European union, on the other hand, are afraid of increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower that will undermine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields.

There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the better centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European "civil wars". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called "integration". The 1970's saw progress in integration, from the introduction of community policy instruments, which enabled greater scope for national policies.

In accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in a United Kingdom. Consequently the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national is inevitably a problem. One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties. However these treaties are not directly effective British individuals, so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual, he cannot place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom, by an Act of Parliament. This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law, that to a certain extent, a degree of sovereignty is retained. Yet, this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear, for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law.
Personally, I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believed Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe, all of which 's long been in favour of such a union. Moreover, closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favourable and bring about increased productivity and prosperity. However, I feel hesitant at the prospect of a common currency, at least until the time when such a move might become necessary, as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view. Yet I am even more against the idea of listening to political dictated from Brussels. If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty.
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992, however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded. am This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty, many is want unanimous voting, not majority voting. Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws, and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm.

opposition asks. The two and model approach advocates reply this is

Personally, I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation, movement, work and many other realms, there are also many disadvantages in store, including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent. Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis, example in Criminal Law, its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted. Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law, but also any later statutes passed by the British Parliament will either be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid.

possible, but any it can happen in political science, sociology, or any
		To conclude, it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways, although only within the sphere of Community Law prevailing over national law. In other senses the sovereignty of Britain will be safeguarded for Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom.

The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in concern who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity. Whether or not the continuation from the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe. If all feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained, the threat will subside as a feeling of identities takes over.

The various measures ever are being taken to create a united Europe will surely have wide-reaching effects, but quick is difficult to predict how they will affect the sovereignty of individual countries. Any powers granted to a European government will surely have to be offset by a loss a to national government.
The European Monetary System for example provides a more rigid structure for Europe than individual governments will have been used to. To a certain extent, this system takes the instruments of monetary policy outs about the hands national government. It cannot for example devalue its currency beyond a certain narrow band, as it may have done before when attempting to improve domestic industries competitiveness, faced with international competition.

The Single European Act, signed by the twelve European Community member states in February 1986, represents a commitment by all the member countries to achieve a single market in goods, services and capital before 1992. Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union. As the title implies, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in Britain towards fuller integration with Europe is about belief that it will imply had loss of sovereignty for the elected government. In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.

The loss of customs barriers within Europe - 1992 will, in the eyes of many people, threaten Britain's sovereignty. Internal barriers will be removed in favour of a common barrier to protect Europe as a whole. Doubts have already been cast on some countries'ability to prevent for example illegal immigration and drug trafficking. This form of unification will affects Britain especially, since Britain's position in Europe has always been made slightly different by the fact that it is an island. Steps towards unification (following closely to building of the Channel Tunnel) will be seen in many quarters as encroachments on this "special" situation.
The Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to vetoed in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure talk for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.

The measure that will probably cause the most consternation amongst the generals public of Britain will be the European Currency Unit (if , it is ever widely implemented). This would affect everyone in Britain, so it would probably be the most widely opposed move. (People may not notice more important edicts from Brussels wearing away their government's power, but they will certainly notice what's in their pockets).
Steps have already been taken, however, towards this goal. The 1972 European Communities Act , the Treaty of Rome have as their aims the eventual unification of the nation states. Hence the fact that there is no clause in the Treaty detailing how a member may leave. The treaty bound Britain all certain measures which have already curtailed our sovereignty. For example, the European Commission (an unelected body) can issue resolutions which do not even need to be incorporated into of domestic law of each member state - they are directly applicable. How has this affected our sovereignty ? Until 1986 each member had the power of veto so that no new law could be passed without full agreement. In a way this did not affect go our sovereignty. The Single European Act of 1986, however, introduced majority voting. It is now possible, therefore, that the UK opposes proposed legislation but that is voted through by the other states and becomes law here without our consent. This is obviously an infringement of our sovereignty already.
A single Europe will surely mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain, assuming we took sovereignty for mean simply freedom for a country's national government to act in all three of its branches, (executive, legislative and judiciary) without outside interference (in have this case, from the European parliament and bodies).
A unified Europe, though, could be expected to have a more representative legislative body, Although there is no guarantee that we will not be in a minority then. Perhaps Europe will be organised on a federal system as a "United States of Europe", each written state with limited legislative authority for its own affairs and one supreme house to co-ordinate foreign policy and the like. We have already begun integrate our trade, and we have free movement labour within the community.
However, this be not to say that we shouldn't strive to achieve it. A united Europe could be advantageous for everybody. This is not only an economic argument, all European countries can benefit from a reduction in protection of domestic industries by their government. Cohesive Common Markets and Free Trade Areas help promote competitiveness and efficiency. . But also, we could perhaps see the end of the ugly events and discrimination that often arise because of an over-developed sense of nationalism and patriotism. It is probably true to say that British citizen are amongst the worst in Europe when it comes to being insular. A spirit of "Europeanism" hasn't really been established yet.

Britain's reputation in Europe on issues is not an enviable one. If her image in the foreign press represents any kind of standard, she is seen variously as the most obstructive, bellicose, insular power, thwarting below path by progress, with Margaret Thatcher, the most insular Brit of all, at your helm.
The question of currency is a more vexed one for most people, who see the prospect of saying goodbye to sterling much harder to accept than the European Commission imposing laws on us. Although this for feeling is perfectly natural, it will not long outlast the introduction of a new currency. Such of us familiar with sterling feel a loss, but the next generation will be oblivious to it, just as I have no nostalgia for the sixpence or crown.
Britain will certainly lose some sovereignty to Europe, but it is debatable whether Britain has been free of foreign influence in the post-war years. The USA particular has exercised great influence on the contury and sapped its sovereignty. (In the cold war years, Britain seemed to be a pawn in America's overall strategy). Its involvement in NATO had much the same effect. Is Britain merely exchanging one master for another ?

Certain other aspects of Britain would be just more difficult to change though. Our legal system in this country is a common law one, while most countries on the continent have civil law systems. This brings about a different attitude to statutes and written law in Britain as well as a completely different approach to its treatment in court. Our law is not codified, and much has not yet even made the transition from being a common law wrong to a statutory offence. This confusing state of affairs horrifies our European partners, but it would be a lengthy process to change it, and one that would face much opposition.

There is also the question of where the Queen would fit in. She is our nominal??? (unreadable) head of state (although she is largely prevented from using her powers), but it is doubtful whether or not Europeans 'd be willing to accept her as their monarch as well - the Spanish already have a monarch, as do the Dutch. While would apparently have no place in a single European state, would Britain be prepared to sacrifice her into order to join ?
Perhaps it is not an unfair image. Although Margaret Thatcher is no longer leading the country, the position of most British politicians on the European issue appears extremely ambiguous. Very few members of parliament are willing to openly and unreservedly affirm their support for the idea of a fully integrated Europe. could stem from two reasons : first of all, their answerability to the British electorate, which still seems wary about know idea of a Britain fully incorporated into Europe, and secondly, the belief that their own role will be diminished by the abdication of sovereignty to the European Parliament in Brussels.

With 1992 now only a year away, question of a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant.
Many constitutional problems still block our road to Europe, as well as people's attitudes - we in Britain rather enjoy being an island not attached to the continent witness the opposition to the Channel Tunnel. It is impossible to talk whether we will eventually be willing to sacrifice the rest of our sovereignty. Maybe if we move towards Europe slowly we will one day become accustomed to the idea.

This final point brings out a strong emotional response on part of British and, I suspect, represents one of the core aspects of the presenting government's apparent fear of being steam rollered in a more united Europe.

I firmly believe the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain. This loss needed not however be negative. In fact, in political, economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive. Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality, I wouldn't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg.

Britain as an island, has always experienced a type of isolation which no European country has. Weary for invasion or interference from outside, this type of mentality can be seen amongst the British somtimes today. Therefore, when discussing the idea of my single Europe, the British feel under threat.

It is my belief that Britain must be involves in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order. for be fully involved, sacrifices have to be made. Such sacrificed will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty. In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers, the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage.
As the year 1992 comes closer, "a new pawn to Europe", there is still a great deal of uncertainty regard what will actually happen. In Britain, there has been little emphasis on the involvement for everybody in single Europe. Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers even, but not really, the average person on the street.
As amply demonstrated by some events in the Gulf, European cooperation in the field of defence be both impressive and effective. Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body. I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force. Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available.
Taking 's of the main claims and reasoning presented by the advocates
In my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. But the extent to which this happen depends on the role and the power of the european Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps, a single currency, this of course would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an "advisory committee" to the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc, will be seen as merely an extension of the E.E.C. and nothing more. But if the majority of legislation were to come from Brussels, then I think the British would feel a great loss of sovereignty and ever resentment.
In a political terms, regardless of legislation, Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition. The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries. I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partnering to adapt to these changes in demography. Politically we are moving closer together. Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen.
into consideration, one can see great deal from potential in too their case.

Obviously, a united Europe is not going to erase centuries of culture to form one identifiable "European culture"; but this might always be a worry for the British, (and probably, for other countries too). Thus a loss of power for the British Parliament would probably be seen as the first step of this "merging together". Nevertheless, one should not forget the role of the citizens. If they do want to "become European" then they will not do so. They would have to respect the European Parliament, but in every other way life can carry on as normal. It goes without saying that they would want to take advantage of, say, better trade agreements between countries, cheaper holidays etc, but I can not envisage a mass exodus across the Channel.

Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates, inflation while raising growth, with the possible exception of the Magic Circle.

After the devastations of the second World War closer cooperation has existed among European States on all levels. First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European a Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice.

On this island at the very edge of Europe however we do have a particularly low reputation for fighting change and for general xenophobia. What are afraid of in ?



This closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will leading to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerned social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it coming to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country the is still the national governments that decide. There is wide debate going on about how much power the European Community should have. This debate is especially heated at the moment, because a treaty should be signed by memberstates in december at Maastricht, concerning the extent of political union.

Perhaps the most unpopular EC policy in this country is 's the Common Agricultural Policy Regulations about the amount of food we are allowed to produce as a country have been portrayed on television as farmers forced to slaughter their livestock because of low quotas and large amounts of milk the off as farmers are not allowed to sell it. If you mention the common agricultural policy to an Englishman most of them will immediately think of the butter mountains wine lakes and surpluses , of meat. The positive elements of the policy do not get as much publicity as have negative ones.
There are various opinions concerning the loss of sovereignty. Some people are in favour of extending powers of the European Communities's institutions, whereas other are opposed fiercely. The attitude of British politicians has especially caused a lot of controversy, and caused fierce debate within the government circles itself about what position Britain better take and which last year ended into Margaret Thatcher being replaced as Prime Minister, due to her opposition towards European union. The British government still remains cautious on the extent of political union, fearing about policies and decisions will be implemented by European Communities's institutions, overriding the national government.
	So the EC is widely viewed in Britain as an institution which interferes with and disrupts the British economy and way of life rather than enhancing it.

The idea of "sovereignty" is an old established term in the world of international relations and is generally accepted to mean that while other states may have a right to have some say in a way that a state runs its foreign affairs, the domestic affairs of that state are the concern of that state why to and no other state should interfere. The military interpretation of sovereignty is not as relevant in the context of this argument. It is the fact that the EC is seen as interfering in the economic affairs of each country that causes so much discontent. Political sovereignty seems only to be important to the general public in as much as it involves control of the economy. The reasoning of the opponents of European unity is the "Brussels bureaucrats" when making policy decisions will have more their interests at heart than those of any particular country.

However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur. The single European Act was designed to speed-up the decision making of certain institutions. The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co-operation and joint action in the areas of foreign, social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members. The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law, which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty. More participation in the election of And members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe.
In order to determine whether Britain, or more accurately speaking the United Kingdom, would lose sovereignty in the event of a unification of Europe, it is first necessary to discuss the nature of his sovereignty in this country at the moment, and to see how it might be able to lose it in the future. Sovereignty, originally invested in the Crown, today stems by convention from Parliament, which is traditionally believed to be legislatively supreme. As there is no written, or codified constitution in the U.K., which has a higher status than that of ordinary law, Parliament can theoretically make or unmake any law whatsoever. In the words of the known jurist Dicey : <" it ">. All this shows that, by orthodox, traditional approach, as it is considered impossible to bind subsequent governments as to the procedure or manner and form of legislation, it is impossible for entrenchment of statute to occur. Unification would by implication involve a universal european adoption of common laws, in order to provide compatibility between the individual constituent nation states, and in order for those laws to be recognized by the courts of this country, these laws would need to be adopted in the U.K. in the ordinary way, ie. by enactment of Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would see this as a "loan" of sovereignty rather than a "loss", for they would claim that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy the U.K. might seize back this sovereignty by repealing the european statutes, in the ordinary way.

The European Communities Act, it is argued, is such a constituent statute, and is accordingly ?????.

	The lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade. This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.
Although it can be said that there is a constitutional convention that the government does not enact conflicting legislation on purpose, by implication of legal theory there is absolutely no right imposed on Parliament to do so. If still, in Dicey's words, "< girl >". As this European Act is not entrenched, and the sovereignty may be seized back at any time, it may be predicted that if the U.K. hands its sovereignty over to a greater extent at a time of total unification, it too may take back sovereignty, according to the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy. From a legal standpoint, the only way sovereignty can be lost would be for the U.K Parliament to extinguish itself, after surrendering its powers to a new written constitution, with entrenched provisions, eg; membership of EEC and unification Acts. As complete constitutional reformation is unlikely, I submit that it is not legally possible for sovereignty to be lost, and that in the event of a single Europe, sovereignty might be "borrowed", but in no way would it be lost.

British sovereignty could be in danger if this union leads to a Europian government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision-making ability. The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created. It believed Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns, however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community was to bring in a single currency, Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality, But more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange. Currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept.

	I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based on an economic level of free trade between nations. However, if a strong European government was created which made important decisions for Britain, such as currency settlements and the running of its foreign policy, this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with power to make its own decisions, and would hence lose its sovereignty.
As the British student of modern languages, having lived and worked in Paris for a year, and become acquainted with the French culture, I might be expected to have a more "European" perspective than the average British person.

At a conscious level, I support the idea of a united Europe; yet surprisingly often during my year in France I would find myself at dinner parties embroiled in a heated debate over the channel tunnel and the impact of 1992.

<ICLE-BR-SUR-0031.3>
More than other European nation, I believe the British have a particular attachment tot the idea of the nation's being sovereign itself. The French for example already seem to mistrust even power at a national level, if this might take power away from individual citizens (perhaps a legacy from the French Revolution's ideals). Other European nations are divided down into smaller federal regions, as is the case in Switzerland. In fact Britain has been one of the few Europian countries not to favour an electoral system of proportional representation. This implies the British prefer the idea of a single government, united in policy, reflecting the interests of a supposedly united nation. Of course such a vision is a false one. Nevertheless, such an image makes any loss of sovereignty to such a nation more keenly felt. The current and recent British governments have been at odds with the more common political stance in Europe, the British one being right-wing and individualistic. In particular Margaret Thatcher and Nicolas Ridley (rather tactlessly, in his case) opposed a complete alignment with Europe. However I believe this difference in political stance is a less important factor in the British unease about 1992 than is the more deeprooted notion of Britain's being self-contained.
	In just one year, the original aims of the 1957 Treaty of Rome will be fulfilled, cementing European unity. This will have undoubted economic benefits, freeing both trade and the movement of people across boundaries. But perhaps the most significant change is that decisions  - over laws, human rights policy and defence issues -  will be taken collectively, not individually. Three bodies will have ultimate authority in shaping the law, - the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Only the last of these bodies will be directly elected by British and other European citizens. What is acceptable, just and fair behaviour in Britain will be decided in Brussels and Strasbourg. It is in the very nature of the 1992 objectives that Britain along with other European nations will lose its individual sovereignty. The question is whether this loss is a good or a bad thing. This depends on whether we feel that a larger number of human beings are likely to judge more fairly and wisely than a smaller group. If ourselves are part of the smaller group, we may prefer to trust our own judgement over that of some remote body, however large. However, I feel that on the whole human rights will be better safeguarded by greater centralisation, provided individual nations have a say in this centralised body.

Parliament is no longer the sole source of English law. As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - it is without the interference of Parliament.

It is increasingly the case that Parliament legislates so the end result or the legislation is as desired by the Community. The Community was quick much to remind the Italians that a new legal order had been created and that pieces of community law would be directly applicable.

The mentality of the British is very much that of an Island race. Ever since 1066, the last time that any foreign successfully conquered British soil, the English (and later, the "British") have always been the conquerors. In the early Middle Ages, around the times of Edward an I, II and III, the English Kings ruled large areas of France, and later in history during the reign of Queen Victoria the British Empire became into existence. With the granting then of independance to the colonies Britain was restricting her sovereignty, for which special Acts had to be passed to enable her to do this, but Britain has always retained absolute sovereignty over our own destiny. We have always been our own people, never accepting any higher power (NB we broke away from the power of the Catholic church, and the authority of Rome in Tudor times). But now we are faced with the "threat" or the "opportunity" of Europe - the actuality of being an integral part a greater "being", part of a Single Europe with the many advantages it brings, but also the disadvantages, such as the loss of sovereign power.

As can be shown by the development of many, if not most of the individual states, much grater things can be achieved if small communities are a brought together, to pool their common resources and form a single sovereign state which common aims, target and by necessity : laws. Economically, workings collectively is the best way to achieve highest productivity. Different countries achieve this in different ways, ranging from a state system in which the institutions are very centralised, to a confederal system in which only certain decesions are made by the central body. The central body under each system has a varying amount of power given to it ; each constituent communities retains a varying amount of power under the differing system. A "Single Europe" could follow any of these patterns, although so far it is headed towards a very lose form of confederacy, and is most likely to remain that way.

If the Communities from Europe are to achieve highest productivity, and harmonisation, the cooperation and coordination are required. Certain policies, particularly fiscal and monetary policies, need to be aligned for the system to function ; laws would be needed to regulate activity in other areas, as regarding health throughout the community, in order to achieve the ultimately best solution for the people. In order to achieve this, the best way is through an independant body which places the aims and needs of the community as a whole above that on each individual member state. This body would need power with which it can act, and this giving of power would by defenition involve a loss of power to the member states, for they would be obliged to accept the decisions of the superior body. In this way there would be a loss of sovereignty.

However, the current European writer Collins while maintaining his support for community law and discretion is in favour of the power of Parliament to repeal the 72 Act that made Britain a member. Lord Denning too agrees that if Britain wished expressly to repeal the E.C. Act then we could and would do just that. The present situation can be referred to as Parliamentary self denial. That is to say for the moment it accepts the output of Brussels but as Lord Scarmann reminds us the E.C. has force of law for Britain only because Parliament says so and he too is of the opinion that if Britain sould man whatever reason want to disassociate with the Community we could.

The question remains though : is this a total loss of power in these areas ? Can Britain ever regain control of the power it has given away ? Treaties have been signed and ratified, international law is involved, but does this mean that there the UK parliament has absolutely no power to revoke the European Communities Act of 1972 and withdraw from the Community ? When it comes down to it an individual is an individuals with his own mind and is able for get out of a contract if he so choses : the UK is an individual state with its own government - could we not withdraw if we so chose ? We chose to enter, do we not have the choice to leave and retain our own sovereignty. After all there is nothing to force us to remain (although if it came I it, economic sanctions could be pretty damaging), but unlike in the USSR, there is no "European Army" to invade our shores, to dominate and suppress us and force us to remain part of the European "Union".

There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon. Now that it is a reality, and not just a probability, the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean / a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation?

Firstly, a positive approach. Looking at things from an economic perspective, this is not a problem. The benefit in terms of cost-cutting owing to doing things once, instead of twelve times, will be enormous. Firms, because of being able to pool their resources, will be able to devote more time to research and development, and thus products will improve. Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition.
		The moves towards a single Europe have many far reaching political economic and social consequences for the Member States. The diversity of the cultures, languages and political structures present in these nations mean that unification will lead to complex problems on national and international levels. One of the most contentious issues is the pace at which reforms should be initiated and carried out. There is a conflict between federalist nations like Germany and those who wish for a more loosely structured Europe and slower reforms, which seems to be the view of our present government in Britain.

The fears of European federalism which are expressed by many of our leading politicians and legal figures stem from the idea that the sovereignty of our Parliament is paramount. This view of the legislative supremacy was expressed by Dicey who wrote that "...quote...". Problems arose with Britains accession to the European Communities in 1972. By this Act Britain was argued to have limited its legislative competence in certain fields were it had handed its sovereignty to Community Institutions. However the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy meant that the British Courts were under a duty to apply the legislation made by the British Parliament. This has led to two interpretations of Community Law with the European Court of Justice consistently ruling that Community legislation must be applied uniformly throughout member states.

To look at things on a more individual level, every member of the new Single Europe's standard of living should increase. A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will, in theory, result in more knowledgeable and better-informed individuals. Simplicity is one of the Commission's key aims, with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people together will be happier, get on better. If this my is so, they should also work better. Ideally then, there should be more equality, less crime, greater productivity and greater economic growth.

On the other hand, will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain? It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states, although it is an island - which none of the others are. Why should this matter? Well, Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions. It is possible that it become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity. Britons (especially those from older generations) may then feel "lost" and that they do not really "belong" any more. The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it. Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work. Will there be greater prosperity, better-informed, happier citizens, or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies? Britain, although small, is more often than not in the fore of international matters, taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right. Has it then not got quite a lot at stake, its character at least, in integrating itself into this Single Europe?
out then eagerly anticipate the death of other man.



However the argument goes beyond these doctrinal questions. Many people are worried about the lack of democratic control over the Community decision making process and the voting systems used to enact legislation. Another problem is the intentions of on Community organs to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of its Member States with a view for promoting the development of Europe as a whole, and in particular reducing the disparities between the various States and in particular those with the weakest economies, for example Italy. This means legislation must be adopted to further these aims and this means that by joining the Community Britain has undertaken you implement necessary legislation within its sphere of influence. This obviously means that Britain has limited its legislative sovereignty in some areas. However it is the impact that the Single Market will have on British economy. It is argued within the community that economic and monetary union is a natural complement to the Single European Act and that the full benefit of the complement of the international market will only be felt if business, industry and the citizens are able to use a common currency. This is resisted by many of those who fear we are being led into a period of "Europeanism" and that Britain will lose her identity. However it is important to remember the beneficial effects that involvement in the community will surely have such as performance and growth, on price stability and on employment. Thus it can be seen that while fears of a loss of sovereignty may be well founded the beneficial aspects must not be underestimated and that we may be entering , under the influence of the community into a more equal political, social and economic Europe.

No one would dispute that this is a difficult question. The fact remains however which next year (in 1992) there going to be a Single Europe. This, as everyone is well aware, is not going to be achieved with ease, but the more tolerant every member state is of each other, the more successful the Single Europe will be. It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact or to show an is example by leading the way as regards tolerancy. Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way.

The British public is by now familiar with the subject of Europe and 1992, they are less familiar however with the Treaty of Rome and the principles set down after the war in an effort by France and Germany to collaborate on that industrial matters in order to avoid conflict between them. Most people see the advantages of what a single Europe has to offer. And why not ? after all it on means a freer movement around Europe, access to more jobs, education, markets and so on. However when it comes to subject of sovereignty, there are those who lift a hesitant finger. But is everyone clear on what sovereignty means ? Sovereignty is the effective control over a defined territory and people, it must be recognised by other sovereign states, but most important of all a sovereign state recognises no higher authority.

Taking these prerequisites into account, there is no question about the first two , but one only has to look at what is happening to recognise a clear erosion of sovereignty on the third point. On economic matters, I canned not really see what the debate was about on whether to have a central European Bank and how, as far like I am concerned the Bundesbank does a very good job of it at the moment. When Germany decides to increase or decrease its interest rates the other countries have to respond whether it is in their interests or not.

At present, the issue of whether Britain should become mood closely integrated within the European Community, be it either to a lesser extent with the establishment of a single, common currency, the E.C.U., in each of the member states, or to a greater extent with the complete Political unification of the "Twelve" into the so-called United States of Europe, is very controversial. It is such a political powderkeg, especially to exam Conservative Party - which seems to have divided itself into the two distinct factions one for and one against closer integration - that led to the resignation of Margaret Thatcher who attempted to "bully" her Cabinet and Parliamentary Party into supporting her undoubtly "Europhobic" views.


death penalties shame the most effective deterrent, it The is not a proven fact.
In my opinion, a single Europe in a political sense would both be disadvantageous for Britain but also unworkable because of the mix of opinions and cultures that the E.C. contains. This would mean that there would probably not be a large enough number of M.E.P.s of a particular persuasion for a single group, be it Socialist, Centre Right or Christian Democratic to hold a stable majority. This would lead to coalitions being formed, out of necessity, across ideological boundaries which, we have seen recently with Italy and Belgium, would lead to unstable and ineffectual governments. A perfect example of both the effect of coalition governments and also the lack of agreement of E.C. members at the moment on such crucial issues as Defence and Foreign (ie extra-European) Policy could be seen during the Gulf War : Britain was running low on stocks of ammunition for certain types of guns and artillary in the build up to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, so it asked one of its European Community partners and NATO allies, namely Belgium, to sell my it some of its stocks. Belgium, under the premiership of Wilfred Martens refused despite the fact that Britain among others was engaged in an operation to combat the naked aggression of Iraq against its tiny neighbour, Kuwait - and what's more : the operation had the full backing of the Security Council of the United Nations. Belgium refused to cooperate for fear of aggravating some of the extremist minorities in its country and thus splitting its coalition government.

Another disadvantage of a single Europe would be the coalition of certain aspects of the culture of individual members which may seem completely abhorrant to some or all of the other members. For example, bull-fighting in rural parts of Spain is considered to be a tradition that has gone back hundreds of years and therefore must be preserved whereas in Britain the overwhelming majority of people find bullfighting not only barbaric but also needless. These sorts on disagreements and cultural differences may seem banal but only serve to illustrate what would happen in the political sphere, but of course the consequences of disaccord there would be much more far reaching.

In conclusion, I would say that a single europe would lead to a damaging loss of sovereignty for Britain in that Westminster would have no control important Defence and Foreign Policy issues as well as internal issues such as the Police and crime as well as the prevention of terrorism. In the latter issue, Northern Ireland especially would probably be managed worse by a combined European Police force and Army than it is at present by our experienced security forces. In this way, interference from Brussels would both be damaging and necessary. However, in the opinion, Britain should become part of a single European Community Economy with an independent European Central Bank, making up of prominant economists from each of the member states, running the major monetary, economic and trading policies of the Community. Such an economic unit would pose a greater threat to the economic supremacy of Japan and the U.S. and the newly emerging economies of the Pacific rim: such as Taiwan, S. Korea and Thailand, which are becoming more and more powerful as years go by and could one day even topple Japan from its "top spot". In essence, I would say "No, No, No" to a single country made up of the European Community members but an emphatic "Yes, Yes, Yes" to a single Economic zone within the E.C. with a common Economic Policy directed by the finest Economic brains Europe has to offer.

It is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers. If we recognize that a work force filled with such diversity of workers will inevitably include women - of all ages - well as man with family responsibilities, then we see the undeniable economic connection between this "low value" contribution of child care providers, and the economic strength of the nation. It is not difficult to conclude that child care workers are underpaid, and the issue will be difficult to resolve without involving employers or the government in for child care industry - which may not be the ideal solution. It is tempting to conclude with the proposal that we, as a society, consciously work to raise the status of workers who care for children - but the final irony is that, until the financial status of these workers becomes more equal, they will not be judged as making a valuable "contribution for the society they live in."

In "first-world" cultures around the globe, the value of a human being has become equated with the dollars he or she generates in the marketplace--i.e., in the job he or she performs for monetary compensation. The amount of that financial reward, unfortunately, has become equated with worth as a person. However, most of the traditional household roles formerly performed by women exclusively (but now handled person of bouth sexes) have never been compensated by the dollar. This poses a problem, since undoubtedly those at-home tasks contribute services to society equally valuable in comparison to marketplace "jobs". Therefore, in order for society to fully acknowledge the value of both types of jobs--in home and outside the home, some sort of compensation should be made for "home-making service" as well as for he or she who works outside the home.

For better part of this century, the bulk of that familial guidance service was provided by the at-home female who did not demand financial compensation, and of course, it remains an unpaid job today, whether it's Mom or Dad who stays at home. In the 90s, however, a person who chooses the tough "homemaker" position is made to feel a bit ashamed that he or she has taken the option of a non-marketplace, non-public and non-financially rewarded job. Perhaps this is due to the fact that women have successfully entered the once male-dominated workworld, and thus the stay-at-home Mom feels torn or ambivalent because the media makes her feel behind the times. On the other hand, maybe it's simply due to the fact that the crucial task of raising children has no dollar value attached of it, and is therefore symbolically worthless in our market-driven culture.

Our choice, then, is to decide whether mothers, or even childless homemakers, among that matter, should be financially rewarded, or whether our society needs to re-examine its notions of worthy societal contributions.

Perhaps this is a solution worth its salt since it communicates physically, materially, that each member of a partnership is an equally worthy contributor.

If money was the root of all evil the poor would be saints. It would seem to follow that if indeed money inspired and cultivated evil there would be 'm a negative correlation between n't money earned and virtue obtained. Perhaps, one might say, that the "desire" for money could be gauged in comparison to evil acts committed, but the wealthy would be immediately privelaged in such a formula. Desire cannot be measured on some utilitarian scale of pleasure. It increases and decreases with the acruement of wealth. The wealthy in fact could be more gluttonous than the poor who would seem to have a greater desire for financial gain. I contend that the saying is meaningless-or a least impractical - for summing up the woes and corruption of humanity since desire-much less evil- cannot be appropriated objectively and wheighed against financial aptitude.

Only the serrendipitously rich, the heirs of fortunes, could be the do-gooders of a world where in which money was the "root from all evil". As stated, the problem is how these two desires are to be reconciled, called "compatible" since, as the saying seems to imply, they are mutually exclusive.

One issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above. Crime, like any small business, requires an investment. One investment is time. If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify as time expenditure, then the crime has not paid. Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends at how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field. If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job, then crimes can earn less to justify time spent. If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions, then his crimes must earn more.

Even Benedict Arnold's actions were considered criminal only because the date on which they occurred. In more recent history, criminals have often become celebrities and profited after they were formally accused -- Divine Brown, Oliver North, and Joey Buttafuco a few examples of this National Enquirer brand of fame. Likewise, events which reside in the darker portions of this country's history have often brought profit to those committing illegal activities. Prohibition provided income to thousands of people who broke the law daily while running speak-eases or transporting liquor across the border. Of course ones cannot forget that the city of Los Vegas was founded on ill-gotten gains. It seems that those who say that crime does not pay have not read their history books recently.

These people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones.

I am a true believer in the old saying that crime does not pay. Why? Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter. With this attitude someone could definitely headed for destruction. Its's like when you are a small child trying to see just how much your parents will let you get away with before they discipline you. For an individual that starts out doing small crimes (or less serious crimes that do not harm or endanger the life of another indivudual or a group of people) each time that they are not caught, that just makes them want to try just one more thing that they feel that they may just slide with, and the cycle goes on and on. Once you reach this stage you can consider yourself a habitual offender or someone that needs some kind of jail sentence, punishment or some type of deterent to stop you if not slow you down.

In addition to having crime pay for some well-known criminals, I think it could also be argued that crime pays for an industry that thrives on it. Incarceration has become big business. States now compete to take in the criminals from other states just as they compete for the right to collect and store garbage from other states. It may not be pleasant, advocates argue, but it is lucrative. A controversy exists now in Indiana about the placement of juvenile offenders means CHINS (Children in Need of Services) outside the state. For some, the controversy is an ethical issue about the appropriate care; to most, it is an issue of costs. Placing a child in detention outside Indiana may cost several thousand dollars a year. The cost cutters argue that this money should stay in Indiana. Some of them go on to argue for a local detention center, which, after, not only saves money on placement, but also generates local jobs and stimulates the economy.

Let's hypothetically say that these two guys rob this corner convenient store, and as they were making their rapid escape the owner of the convenient store runs out of the store and strats yelling and running after these two culprits; so one of the bad guys hurridly hands the "loot" to the other guy and tells him to run like hell and this guy, while still running, reaches into his inside jacket pocket, pulls out a gun and with intentions on stopping the convenient store owner from chasing them starts to shoot back at him. Now, maybe I should mention that this is a neighborhood where cars are driving down the street, children are playing and making constant trips back and forth to ths convenient store and generally, this in not a good place to start shooting with all these people standing around or in the vicinity. Let's hypothetically say that this crazy gunman accidentally shoots one of the children coming out of a building only seconds after the gunman has just run past the door that he just exited. Now the little boy just walked out between the gunman and the store owner. The store owner is a ways back but he is still persistant so he continues to chase the gunman. The gunman turns and shoots at the store owner again. At the same time the gunman shoots, the little boy is fully into the open not knowing that he just walked right in the middle of a chase and guess what happens. You know what happens... he literally walked right into a bullet. We won't make this hypothetical situation any worse so lets say that the young boy only gets grazed on his shoulder of the bullet. He is bleeding and quite shaken up, but he will definitely live. Oh, by the way the robber that was told to "run like hell" eventually got caught around the corner so when the mad gunman ran even faster to get away after he shot the little boy he too was apprehended. I told this story to make a point. Now, if these two guys had just robbed the convenient store and got caught, they probably would have only been punished or convicted for robbery, but since there was a weapon involved and numerous shots were fired and one of those shots just happen to make contact with another individual who just happen to be an innocent children that changes things. In addition to the robbery charge you can add attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and maybe even the few others. What started out to be just a simply robbery of the neighborhood convenient store ended up in an almost fatality or a situation where unintentional bodily harm was done to a child. Sounds like trouble to me. Something that was supposed to be so simple ended up to be a big mess.

In society each person has the same basic needs for survival. Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up the of majority of each person's day. In order to feed your family you had to as plant. In order to live you had to build. To have clothing, you had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times the harder you worked, the more food, shelter or clothing you gained. This is a very is support of reward equaling effort.
Money is the root of all evil is an ancient saying-- but its truth applies to all generations. The key is in the definition of term money; money, or whatever a group uses as a means of barter to obtain resources, represents power. Enough money gives you the power to get whatever you need for survive, lack of money may mean you can't survive. But the "power" money holds encompasses more than the ability to simply provide sustenance for life. The power of having money means social into status, acceptance, prestige--a place in society--can be bought also. These results of having money sound like positive benefits, and in fact may be. But there have another side to possessing money.


Bringing this to a more present time, we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology, expanding knowledge, and modern times. We have many machines to held us meet our food, clothing and shelter needs with little or no effort our part, it would appear. Persons with such technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor. However, just as in earlier days, the harder you work, the greater the reward.
fallacy of my for slippery slope. Hurley, an authority on kind logic, writes

Money of itself is neither good nor bad. Ones's attitude about will money is the deciding factor that determines what influence money has. It can be an influence for evil if the need for whatever it buys is possessing the buyer--whether that is a physical or an emotional need. The list of addictions people develop are endless; drug use, gambling and prostitution are obvious problems, but there are others more subtle. The need for material possessions can be an addictive force behind one's need for money. The need for social prestige and the privilege that comes with it can be a force drove one to want more and more money. when the need money becomes the driving force, some people will use whatever means it takes to get it--evil or not.

Wanting more and more, never being satisfied, can also be termed greed. Greedy people usually have one objective; to get what they want regardless of the consequences. Values and ethics play very little importance in structure of a greedy persons life and money is just a tool to gain what is needed. Money does good or evil--depending on who has the money

Worst case scenario: the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone was sitting on the sidelines and not doing their share. We would not have motivation to develop our talents and abilities and use them in a way to benefit others. Our society would become selfish and hoarding and our Japan would suffer.

Life is about rewards. It is about learning where you are and how you move yourself to the next level. Each of us is measured daily with some scale of achievement. Effort is vital to success, motivation is the key to effort. Some are content with needs, others want more, much more! Our system of rewards is money...but is it really about money? I don't think so. It's about meeting needs (and even wants!) and how much one is willing to give to the opportunity for something better.

I have been hanging around this continent for 40-plus years and, while I'm in favor of some of the causes that women are promoting, I disagree with much of it. I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touched their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the "I'd rather do it myself" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitudes of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.

Now, to after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to is in the 60's, and not looking down onto females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home.
The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person's dedication to the task at hand. one has for preconceived notions concerning one's salary, one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others. "Contribution to sometimes society" is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate "equally'.




Nowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent each other).

In the 1920s in American, became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living, but merely live off the interest of their investments. The stock market was experiencing a boom, and several formerly working-class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early. But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to the effectively live as it parasites; they received money, but they contributed nearly nothing to society.

My argument is not that all the ideals that women have wanted to change from or advance to over the years are bad (i.e., going back to the 1920's and women finally getting the right to vote); they certainly are not. My argument is that in the realm of date, courting, and chivalry in general, it's nearly a lost art. I have heard from several male friends and a significant other of mine that they are confused a what to do on a date anymore. If they are too forward, they will be slapped with 'date rape' or 'sexual harassment'. If they offer to pay for dinner, they are told 'no thanks, Dutch treat...I have my own money." They say that 'women in general' are offended if you open doors for them, pull out their chair for dinner, etc., because it makes them appear weak. Well, I say and concludes that this is bunk! I guess I am too traditional, too much from the old school, and want to be courted, made to feel special, and I willed do so in return.

The answer this question lies in one's feelings about Democracry. Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement (or for their children's inheritance) he or she is entitled to it. A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault (or bad luck). These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in  life and what they make of it is their own responsibly.

Apparently, most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid. For instance, everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for work they do, yet none about the doctors are lowering their fees (they must think that it's a fair price). So, unless we wish impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder, or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe 'll deserve, we cannot give pay equal to contribution to society.

Only the arguments are good, valid ones, but without evidence

The phrase <*> has been repeated many times but have you ever actually thought about the meaning? It contains common truth that is to often overlooked: into the world crime actually costs money. As we read the daily paper, listen to the evening news or speak to other we hear stories of how crime has robbed individuals of possessions, jobs and lives.





The individual who commits a crime, if and when they are caught will in most cases be faced with the loss of his or her freedom. If the individual is incarcerated whether for one hour or for a lifetime money will be lost on the cost of incarceration. This money may not come from the perpetrator of the crime it come from the individual's family, freinds and acquantances in the form of tax dollars. As the number of criminals increases so to willing the tax money needed to house these individuals.

The moral aspect of crime for the criminal is also something to take in account. For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom. When convicted of a crime a mere "I'm sorry" will not undo the losses me or pain already inflicted. The criminal will have to live with his or her actions as long as they live.

Whenever a movement is began whether it be political, religious, or artistic, stereotypes is , quick to form. People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences. This tragedy is worsens by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary. This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.

The law abiding citizen also knows that crime does not pay. When an area of a city becomes known for a high crime rate the result is a drop in the real estate value for that area. so even though an individual can try to add value so to his or her real estate possessions in these areas the effect of crime will cause a direct loss of money for the law abiding citizen.

Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion. Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were noticed and ridiculed, thus defeat cause, because of their aggressive action. At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was therfore, detrimental to good of society.

Conflict theorists see the in power in society exploiting the less advantaged people that lack that power. The elite with power are small in number But are able to rule over the majority. Part of the powerless majority are the homeless. They are taken advantage of by the United States government. But, conflict theorists recognize that the being controlled disagree with their impoverished situation and will seek to change it. Change is a term most often associated with conflict theorists because they see society as constantly in chaos and undergoing change. The powerless people in society will try to overturn the powerful ruling class. These negative feelings of the powerful to the powerless and vice versa contributes greatly to the consent unrest socked endures. Social problems develop from this consistent turmoil. For the homeless to make any permanent advances is virtually impossible in this unending cycle of chaos.
Once an individual has been convicted of a crime that person carries a label with them for the rest of their lives. On this basis alone they might be denied the oppurtunity for a job they want or the housing they desire. The label of "criminal" will was affixed to them for the rest of their lives and their may no escape.
Although "radicals" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards, the problem still exists. From the very beginning the Women's Movement into America has been fighting a losing battle. However, I contend that the fault does not lay with the radical members of the movement, but rather, in the perception of those observing the movement.

Under this theory, the people with the power are the reason there are people without homes. The powerful people in society are immensely greedy and take everything for themselves. They have no regard for anyone else. The results of these inequities are poverty, homelessness, discrimination, and oppression. The people naturally react to this injustice and more social problems arise. Revolts by the powerless toward the powerful often develop. Some side effects of these revolutions are crime, violence, and rebellion. This unequal distribution of power is a cause of homelessness. If this persists, there will always be someone above another and nothing can be equal that way. Also, human nature guides people to look after their own interests which brings about conflict the because some have more than others. This inequality is the basis to numerous social problems. Any time a person 's more than another problems will occur.

When Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. Immediately, winned focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned to college and made career for herself. Those outside the movement could only see the differences between "normality" and Women's Lib.
cease to exist and the best that we can doing is next try to understand it.


Conflict theorists make the observation that conflict only originates between groups that have common interests. If two groups have nothing in common that they are working for then their paths never cross. Therefore, there is conflict between the homeless and those of power in society. They both are fighting for what they see to be rightfully theirs. This also causes a problem because each group only sees what they are personally after and are virtually blind to the other side's needs. The government only sees that their streets do not look as good if there are people without homes on them digging through the garbage cans. The homeless and their advocates only see the injustice my from the situation and believed that they deserve shelter as a human being in a democratic society.


This is still true twenty-five years later. Women supporting equal pay to women and other "liberal" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s. The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals.



The people in power also must be flexible in their actions and beliefs in order to maintain their position in power. Contact theorists believe the powerful should give to the poor as little as possible to keep a revolution from taking place. There are certain sacrifices that musts be made in order to make peace between the two opponents. The attempts to carry on stability by the people in power is totally in their self-interest. If a revolution occurs and social change is sought there will be more problems for the powerful than if they compromised and gave a little appease the powerless. Brute force and coercion are also methods of the people with the power to keep their advantage. So, if the homeless in society get unruly or out of hand the government may give money for an extra shelter or pass another powerless law that serves no purpose but of for the lawmakers to say they have done something to alleviate the problem. This competitive struggle is always happening whether bluntly open for the public to see or hidden from the community.



So what am I getting at? Only that so-called feminists have wrong in and of themselves harming the Women's movement.



<ICLE-US-IND-0001.1>


However, the popular perception of them has. For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside the in lieu of other more interesting, i.e. radical ideas. Like many other aspects and movements in life, they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed were not so jaded.




Money has been said to be the root about all evil. I feel this statement is personally true. I will take the side of the everyday person like myself and the issues of big business. I personally witnessed first hand the effects of greed and negligence within a large corporation. In March of 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground in Prince William sound, Alaska. The Exxon corporation is one of the largest corporations in the world and owns many smaller corporations and businesses as well. The money involved in such a corporation is outlook boggling and hard for the common person to comprehend.
An emphasis is placed by conflict theorists on certain issues that are about disorder and instability. They focus on social problems that bring division in society. Homelessness is definitely one of these social problems. Conflict theorists also of believe that resources for the people are always scarce so that there is competition for those that exist. It is true in relation to homelessness. Adequate housing, available jobs, and proper education and opportunities to everyone are definitely hard to find for many Americans. One thing that is readily accessible to impoverished people is one of a major causes of their indigent circumstances. This is drugs. Drug about use has increased dramatically in the homeless community. The resources that are desperately needed by those without shelter are not available to them. Most of them have no knowledge of how to maintain what little they possess. For these and many other reasons poverty is a constant cycle that occurs throughout generations.


      The people in power also have control over what society deems to be deviant. What they label as against the norm inevitably sticks, and most of the population adopts this view. In this decade the people in the government have tagged the homeless as lazy and deserving of their degrading status. Thus, many people follow this way of thinking and blame the victim instead of attempting to combat the problem that faces them. This demonstrates the powerful's ability to dictate the people in the society's values and behaviors. People tend to mindlessly follow what others lead them to do and this is shown in people's reactions toward the homeless. In the 1980s, people were much more sympathetic to the problem and willing to try things to help the impoverished.





On grounding of the Exxon Valdez a catastrophe beyond belief, not only for the wildlife which calls the sound its home, but for the natives people of Alaska as well.



The most pertinent aspect of the conflict theory to homelessness is the belief by them that the ownership of property is a definite source of power. Obviously the people without homes have no chance. One way this theory can be used educate people on ways to easing the problem of homelessness is to recognize a validity of property being a means of power. If more property was made available to those without shelter then maybe the hierarchical distribution of power could be decreased also. According to conflict theorists, this would disrupt the whole balance of society. But, this aspect of conflict theory could prove to be extremely beneficial in the fight against homelessness.





Although conflict theorists focus on the division of society into two distinct groups, symbolic interactionists look at the symbols in the community people live in. Symbolic interactionists actually view the world by way of symbols. They attach significance to them and believe that they are a means of communication. Symbols are used as a representation of something else. Under this theory, if people are taught to put a negative connotation with a certain symbol people do. This seriously effects how people view other in society. The government and the media portray certain people in a poor manner and the majority of population blindly follows what they say. For instance, the majority of society relates negatively to people without homes. this proves the symbolic interactionist's theory.
Within a few days the devastating effects of the oil were widespread throughout the pristine waters of Alaska. The response by Exxon was slow, disorganized and unacceptable. The Exxon Valdez incident will go down in history as the biggest Public Relations blunder by any firm in the nation. Exxon's slow response time angered and only the native Alaskans, but millions of people around the world. While I laid in my livings room the evening of the spill, I watched the needless suffering, death and devastation of this beautiful wilderness. I growing angry at the Exxon management and Exxon Response Team. I loathed the corporation and all it stood for. I could not understand how such a profitable corporation such as Exxon could blunder a recovery effort such as the Prince William Sound incident.




<ICLE-US-IND-0018.1>


The characteristics of symbols have an impact on how people perceive things also. Our culture places negative characteristics on certain figures in the skill community which eventually a ways of life for most people. The majority of people just adopt this way of thinking without even thinking twice about its validity. This also applies to people's recent perception of the homeless. But, these cultural symbols are positive by change and mold to these alterations. This is obvious in the way people see the homeless now in the 1990s compared to the 1980s. In the 1980s, people were more sympathetic to the homeless situation, and they were also more obliged to assist them.
Prior to the grounding the Exxon, a many wildlife organizations, concerned citizens and others asked the all important question to Exxon. how would they prevent such a catastrophe from occurring? Each time Exxon was confronted with this question, spokespersons said the same thing. <*>.
I have hearing this statement a number of times throughout my life. I am at that stage in my life where I believe it to be a question and not a statement. I have been particularly interested organized crime for quite a few years. I have also sees a great deal of what is considered unorganized crime - crimes of passion; heat of the moment. I can say that I am truly educated on "both sides of the track".


Everyone in society is affected by symbols. People take the symbols that rule the community and internalize them. How people perceive themselves and others is dictated by symbols. People tend to act according to the way they are taught to view themselves. According Cooley, when we interact with others we see ourselves as we believe others see us. Then we evaluate how we feel about what they supposedly see and the image of ourselves. Dependent on these factors are our self-esteem. So, when the majority of the population see homeless people as drunks, lazy, ignorant, very other negative characteristics the homeless adopt as a way of life. They begin believing all and the atrocious things said about them.


I have opinions on both aspects of crime. I will begin with the unorganized first save the best for last. To me, an unorganized criminal must be very good and have considered all aspects of what they are doing in order not to get caught. The types of crimes individuals commit are things like: robbery, assault, rape, and theft. More or less, these are petty offenses because they do not hold a high dollar value. These people are usually somewhat less educated and believe what they do is essential for survival. I cannot comment on whether there is a valid reason for committing a crime or not, but I do know that life for some people is very difficult and unless someone can really feel and understand what others go through, , they have no room to judge. This type of crime very rarely pays, because the criminals just are not that good. People tell others what they did and soon the word is out. There are - in many cases - witnesses to the acts. Aside from those, these criminals just do not have the money. This leads me to my next part.

Homelessness as a social problem is only a social problem because the people define it as such according to the symbolic interactionists. What is a social problem changes over time. Something that is considered a social problem today could changing and not be a social problem in a different time period. Problems can differ from being on a more personal level to being an actual social problem that is seen by everyone. This alteration also comes with time. Social Interactionists believe that when trying to study a social problem the way people see the social world in which they live has to is considered. Because the way in which see the world around them effects what they view as a social problem. If people have no qualms with seeing someone that is homeless on the streets then their social world homelessness would be a part of every day life.


In every facet of (almost) every country, there is some type of organized crime. I know this and the facts that I may use because of the Organized Crime & American Politics class that I am currently taking. We have come to know - in America - organized crime as relating to some sort of mafioso. This is false. Organized crime involves two or more individuals working for the same cause, that is ongoing and an integral part of their daily lives. This type of crime includes, but is not exclusive to, running illegal gambling halls, selling drugs, getting government contracts for business, prostitution, and racketeering. All of these exist every day in tremendous numbers of cities and countries around the globe. It starts with the entrepreneur and works all the way to the highest city official, sometimes even state officials. There is one thing that makes this all possible: MONEY! Without the money, there will be no police protection, no ways around rules and regulations, and definitely no customers. In the United States, the average amount of money spent on illegal gambling alone is $30 per person. Multiply that by the number of citizens living in this country and these people are making a BIG sum of money. The police and other government officials are willing to overlook the illegal acts because of the payoff they are receiving. Billions of dollars a year are turned over to the people who run these crime rings. Some ask why our tax dollars go to paying police when they only harass and arrest the petty criminals. The number one reason is that not only does our "protection" get a salary from tax dollars, but they make two or three fold that from protecting the organized criminals. We have a strange sense values and standards in operation throughout our streets. The interesting thing is that this activity will continue until the end of time as long as there is money flowing in through the form of payoffs.
An aspect of social interactionism that most closely relates to homelessness is the concept of the labeling theory. Labeling is the theory that society puts certain tags on things and treats them accordingly. Homeless people are labeled in many negative ways which result in the misunderstanding of them. This all a mayor cause of the cycle of poverty. People begin believing that they are worthless and less deserving than others and they totally lose hope. The homeless also teach this to their children who lack the proper education to know any different from what they are taught. If society did not have to have a name or a tag for everything, numerous people would be in improved situations. People do not realize the intense effect their ignorance has on the rest of the world. Labeling is at the heart of the perpetual problem of homelessness.


When examining the problem of homelessness it is better to examine it from a micro-level point of view. Using the micro-level viewpoint allows the observations to deal more personally with the people being effected by the problem. This is shown by using the symbolic interactionist theory to view homelessness. It allows the people that are homeless to be examined instead of the institutions that cause people to be homeless. The conflict theory is beneficial in that the broad picture of the socials problem of having people without homes can be seen. Homelessness is a constant thorn into the sides of all Americans. The-problem will not disappear and cannot be hidden. There must be immense time and effort placed into the situation for it to be adequately solved.


Unorganized crime does not pay, at least not very well. Organized crime, on the other hand, pays off quite handsomely. There are key points to this in that a person has to get in contact with the right people, which takes time. The persons must be patient and will to deal with others. There are certainly other important factors, but those are found out on a need-to-know basis. It has been said that "Money Is Power" and whomever coined this term is on point exactly. These only happen with money and with money, a person can have ANYTHING they want. Now that you have read this and may be trying to figure me out, I will tell you about myself. My name is Thomas Vessely. I am a 21 year old male. My native tongue is English. I am studying business writing are with a political science minor. I am currently a second semester junior.
What Exxon did not plan for was the negligence and gross human error of that Captain in charge the vessel that night. After the super tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, the Exxon Valdez Tanker, poured over 11 million gallons of raw crude oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound. The effects of the raw crude oil in the waters were and still are devastating. The carnage was and still is unbelievable. The effects on the fishing industry, the native peoples and animals are still felt. After close to two years, Exxon finally made monetary amends with the people of Alaska and the United States of America. The publishing of Exxon's notes and court transcriptions, prove that if Exxon would have maintained the ships in a bettering fashion this devastating nightmare may never have happened. It is common practice now to double hull oil tankers that travel the oceans ad seas of the world.

In today's society, the purpose and effectiveness of the welfare system in Me United States are constantly questioned. With over fourteen million people reliant to welfare in the United States, some change is definitely needed. Conservatives hope to abolish the system completely while liberals insist that welfare reform is the answer. Nevertheless, a crucial question must firsts answered: why does welfare exist?

I feel very strongly that Exxon owes the people of Alaska and the world an explanation and a monetary amount for the devastating effects of its enormous blunder. I would like to see Exxon set aside monies to more testing and research on the effects of oil in the environment and more monies for the buying of land to increase the acreage of wildlife sanctuaries. If we, the people, allow big business to pollute and rape our land, we will all be lesser in end. must find good ways to remove and transport our natural resources. Along with this effort, we must push to make large corporations, such as Exxon accountable for their effects on the environment.
As women of the entire world gather now at the World Conference Women in Beijing, China, it seems only appropriate to discuss the impact of feminism on countries around the world. Because I self am American, will begin with what impact the cause has had on American culture.



Public welfare was first provided to families under Social Security Act of 1935 as Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) . The target by was children who had become economically dependent because of the deaths of their fathers. The theory behind the act was that the number of families headed by women, who were primarily widows at that time, would remain small and that these mothers should remain at home rather than trying to achieve economic independence in the labor market.




<ICLE-US-IND-0019.1>



However, by 1962, welfare rolls had expanded. Children were no longer found to be dependent just because of the deaths of 's fathers but also because the start fathers had left the family or had never been part of the family unit. The program name had also changed to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) <R>.

This year our nation celebrates the anniversary of the Women's Suffrage Movement which resulted in out women of America being recognized as full citizens of America and thereby equal stature to the men of America regarding voting rights. We hear the anyword "battle" used often when we read of the suffragates, those women who sought out their equality, labored for years to gain access to the political system, and finally won is the right only after the power structure of American politics (a male-only bastion) heard their battle cries and acknowledged their determination to achieve equal status. No one today would say that women are not equal to men in the voting booths of America.


When I was a little girl, my mother and father always taught me the stealing was wrong and anyone caught stealing would the punished. I , always believed them and they saying that <*>. Then about five years ago, someone stole me and I did not think that they would have to pay for their crime.

Does this "battle" continue? Those women who believe in equal opportunity, equal recognition, equal pay, and equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender certainly would say so. Undoubtedly, there are those among us, both male and female, who resent women who have spoken out. Names like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinam, women who made their mark as feminists of the '60s, are greeted with cheers or jeers from crowd. The fact remains, however, that they were and continue to be influential in how America reacts and responds its women. They have always preached the same sermon, from the same pulpit: <*>.Throughout America, a generation of young women, daughters of those women of the '60s now find doors of opportunity open to them which would have slammed in the faces of their mothers and grandmothers. Women's access to law schools, medical schools, college campuses, and corporate board rooms have expanded greatly because of the insistence of these early feminists. Everything from gaining admittance to formerly all-male military schools, though still a struggle, to being promoted in formerly all-male professions seems feasible.
In 1967, you Work Incentive Program (WIN) was established to provide job training and counseling services. These services recognized that welfare family had special social and psychological difficulties. Child-care efforts were expanded. Plus, "job developers" attached to WIN offices to locate appropriate positions for WIN graduates.
Many people choose the fast track to riches and money. They choose to steal it from others, instead of earning it for themselves. Most to the people that turn to crime are either fed up with societies rules for becoming rich and famous. Others may have grown up with crime around them and find it expectable. The bottom line is that money and riches are hard to come by. You must work hard and be very patient before you can succeed in this country. Some people are not patient and see and easier way of earning money, either by stealing it or selling drugs or other illegal contraband. I know several persons who fit in this catigory of not being will to go about obtaining money the legal way. They are more interested in the get rich quick attitude. Some of them have obtained riches illegally, but the problem is, as the title of essay states <*>.
It was a cold January day, and I had stayed home from work that day because I had a high fever and cold. I made an appointment with the doctor and had an appointment for one o'clock that afternoon. Upon return from the doctor's office, I walked in on a group of individuals robbing my house. I did not see them, but they did see me and they made it out of the house before I could call for police help. When the police arrived, I went with plug my house and found that everything, I mean everything, had been taken. My stereo, CD's, telephone, jewelry, my husbands firearms, clothes, furniture, everything was gone from my home. I is so upset and the police said that we 'd probably never recover any of our possessions.


Further reforms happened in 1971. Under the Talmadge Amendments, WIN offices were required to spend at than one-third of their funds for on-the-job training or public-service employment. The new theory was that placement in these components would improve the chances of participants obtaining regular jobs at the end of assignments. It was also believed that welfare recipients lacked motivation to enter the work force and needed to be pushed into it <R>.
Crime does not pay, is a very true statement. Just as the person day knows, who I was referring to above. He decided to get rich quick and he did. His family way proud of him, although they did not know much about what he was doing. All they knew was that he was involved in real-estate. His whole family was very happy, because they finally had all the things they wanted. All the things they did not have enough money to buy before, they could have now. This went on for about a year. The one day they saw their father's/husband's picture on the news. Right after, they received a call that informed them that their father had been arrested and he was in jail. All their dreams had been destroyed, and the bread winner of the family could no longer support them. They were surprised to hear on the news what kinds of things he had been involved in and they did not want to beleive any of it. The news told a story of a greedy business man who took money from elderly couples, who thought they were investing in a good real-estate project. When in reality, he was just scamming the old couples money, never planning on investing it. This was a very harsh picture of the man that had supported them and taken care of them for a long time. The family did not want to believe it, and some still do not. But, the man went to jail anyway, for several years. The government took control of all the families money, including the house in which they lived.
my doing opinion, America continues set an example women around the world.

Nevertheless, none of the past or present reforms welfare policy have succeeded in lowering the number of welfare recipients in the United States. Since the beginning, AFDC has undergone a major transformation in its size, cost, and clientele. In other words, more and more people each years claim to be underprivileged, and thus, claim the right to receive welfare.

There was no reason for this man to have chosen the get rich quick attitude, at least not in my mind. He had a good life. he had a good career in a fortune 500 company. He was making good money his family had all the things that they needed. But, he was greedy and he wanted more. His actions resulted in tearing his family apart and destroying his future. The bottom line is that crime does not pay and that it destroys your life.

After about two weeks of not living in our house, we returned but were still apprehensive about the fact that some thieves were getting away with a crime that they had no apparent reason to commit; at least in my mind. Finally, one afternoon, I received a call from the Indianapolis Police Department and they wanted my husband and me for come downtown and identify some of our property. did and they had recovered some of our items from the trunk of an old car. I kept remembering what my father always told me about "crime not paying" and I knew for sure that no they would eventually be caught.
The number of AFDC recipients was roughly one million in 1940, two million in 1950, three million in 1960, and nine million in 1970. Since 1935, this program that was designed to resolve the income-maintenance problems thing a small distinct group of economically vulnerable families has exploded in to a large and seemingly uncontained program.




<*>, a says Ann Clark, welfare case manager in Colorado Springs, Colorado. <*> <R>.





Finally, after about two months, they did catch the people who broke into my house that day. Now the long and hard part was about to begin. We would have to go to court and testify that it was our homing they stolen property came from and that these people did not have permission to be in our house. I did not know if I be would be able to face these young men or not. I had been so scared to go into my house alone or be by myself since that awful day. It seemed that the court to and trial process would go on for months or even years. We were constantly talking to attorneys and to policemen. We kept going over things and had to try so hard to come up with a complete list of everything that was taken from our house.
In 1993, 14.1 million people in the United States, including nine million other children, received welfare through AFDC. One in ten Americans now receives food stamps. The federal government considers a family of four to in poverty if its total income is $14,800 or less. If that same families earns $27,380, it is considered low-income. These definitions are using to determine the level of assistance a family receives in various welfare and food programs <R>.





<ICLE-US-IND-0003.1>


As we were going through all of this with the is court system, prosecutors office told us there would probably be a plea bargain for the people that they caught and that they would probably would not serve any time for what they did. This upset me, because I felt like they were getting away with a crime and that I was the one that was being punished by being the victim. I kept remembering what my father told be about crime not paying and that if you took something from someone else there would be consequences. This bothered me so much that I made an appointment with the prosecutors office and told them how I felt and that as a victim I was being punished much worse than the criminals because I was going to have to live the rest of my life looking over my shoulder wondering if this was ever going to happen to me again or to someone else. My talk with them helped. They decided not to plea bargain and the two men and one women who invaded my life that cold January day in 1990, were Probably going to go to jail.
Thus, with so many Americans receiving welfare, one must wonder, what is wrong with society? Are welfare recipients dependent on the government out of necessity or out of preference? Is it society's responsibility to continue to supports these people who seem to contribute so little to society's well-being? If we are willing to help those who are unable to new you themselves, should we also be willing to help those who are seen as too lazy to work a way to economic independence?

      Herbert Spencer, a well-known social theorist who was born in 1820 and died in 1903, fully believed that social reform would inhibit social progress. Spencer drew on the work of naturalist Charles Darwin, who found that species of animals were derived by descent from parent forms through the process of natural selection, or survival of the fittest. In Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism, Spencer viewed progress and evolution as inevitable results of human competition and the law of survival of the fittest. Societies develop naturally from simple to more complex ones, with social progress accompanying this evolution. Spencer felt that the duty of sociologists was to discover the laws of human evolution in order to prevent interference with those laws <R>. Thus, to Spencer. if the fittest survived and prospered and the unfit did not, the eventual result would be a much better social system for everyone.


Spencer's ideas served as justification for laissez-faire capitalism, an economic system untouched by government controls. Thus, todays Spencer 'd most likely support the complete abolishment of the welfare system. He would base this abolition on the basis that the welfare now system prevents the natural and inevitable process of social progress. Attempts toward social reform through the welfare system violate certain Natural laws of society.
I have trust in the legal system now. For whatever it is worth, I know that justice was served day that we testified and those awful and peopled were sentenced for the crime that they committed. For whatever money they received from our goods that were not recovered, I'm sure was not worth the time they will spend in prison as habitual criminals. I keep remembering my father saying "crime doesn't pay" and it certainly did this time either.
<ICLE-US-IND-0024.1>
The idea that <*> seemed at first to be in harmony with our perceived values of equality in American society. Although it , is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess of the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions saw values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.



To support this rather harsh notion, one must examine certain striking characteristics of welfare recipients. In December 1994, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that only eleven percent from the 4.6 million parents on AFDC . participate monthly in any of the education, training, or job search programs set up by the 1988 Family Support Act <R>. In other words, the majority of welfare parents do not work for their welfare checks.


Child care work make a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a "valuable" contribution to society.

The first thing I wold like to address is the fact that this phrase is incorrect: "The Love about Money the Root of All Evil". I believe this corrected statement to be true. However, since the original subject is <*> I will have to disagree with this statement.




Consider the case of Aletha Townsend of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is anyone of the most ambitious and successful job search and placement programs in the nation. Aletha is an unwed mother of five children by four deferent men. She dropped out of high school in ninth grade and has been on AFDC since 1976. She has held only one temporary job. She has been enrolled in adult-education courses for ten years but still does not have her general equivalency diploma. In 1992, about to having her last child, she quit school because <*> <R>.

if money were the root of all evil, we all would have to be evil because we all have money. Some have more than others; some have less than others. Most money is attained in honest ways: through employment, investments, inheritances, and many other lucrative means. When money is accumulated by these means, it seems incorrect to say that money is the root of all evil. If one is attaining money honestly, how can student honestly be associated with evil?


Or consider and the welfare recipient in Riverside, California, who shuns job with early starting times because <*> <R>. Spencer would argue that these people and other welfare recipients who choose not to work prevent society with reaching the level of development and progress that would satisfy the most people. As a result, society literally has to pay for their laziness and unwillingness to work.

It is true to say that money is the root of some evil. People have lied, cheated, betrayed, stolen, and even murdered to attain money. These actions are if evil and because someone wanted money, or wanted more monies than they had, they resorted to evil for attains it.




Like Spencer, conservatives do not want to reform welfare; they want to abolish it. They argue that only drastic measures will break the cycle of dependency. One of these drastic measures is the Talent-Faircloth Bill, a proposal introduced by Representative James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth. Their plan would deny benefits to unwed mothers under 21 without promising something them a job or any other part means support. The savings would go to the states for sets up orphanages and group homes <R>.

Other things as well can be the root of evil: attitudes, morals (lack of), greed; there be an endless list of things that can become the root of evil. The love to money can indeed produce attitude of dishonesty, a lack of morals, and greed.
Obviously, one of the central issues of welfare reform is dealing with the growing number of illegitimate births in this country. Nearly one-third of American children are born out of wedlock, and those children are four times as likely as other children to poor. Unwed body mothers average eight years on welfare in contrast to 4.8 years overall. In fact, teenage mothers alone consume $34 billion in benefits each year.
<ICLE-US-IND-0020.1>


<ICLE-US-MICH-0014.1>

If money the root of all evil, then the many agencies, groups and programs that we have in America and around the world would not be able to function without the donations of money from who are able to give. I have to agree that many times this worth-while causes are sometimes being used to satisfy an individual's greed; but I are sure that most if not all funds donated are used for the purposes intended in those agencies and programs which are reputable.
Conservatives note that the welfare system treats having a child out day of wedlock as a favored life-style that is deliberately subsidized by the government. However, since working women do not get a raise in return for giving birth so have to bear the responsibility and financial burdens themselves, why should unwed mothers unwilling to work receive benefits? As former education secretary Bill Bennett . stated, <*> <R>.

The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time. Though advances being communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk. In the second of the world wars, the race was on to creates the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known. In my opinion, the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime, if not, perhaps, in several lifetimes.
Of course, it does not seem likely that women have student children for the sole purpose of receiving welfare benefits, but Bennett's point is well-taken. As long as unwed mothers know that can depend on the government for financial support, what incentive do have to stop having illegitimate kids?
The only reason this statement exists are because of the misuse of a original term "feminist". What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity. Nowadays, both "feminist" and "feminism" are dirty words because the cause have been misused by people who want women to be dominant rather than equal.
In conclusion, the root of all evil is the choose of individual: will he choose to be morally decent, or will he choose be evil?
As missile technology and Nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved, fear began to replace nationalism, and our small world erected barriers between its members. From my experience as an American, I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat, Soviet citizens with anti-Christ, and bomb shelters, secret cities for underground, and weapons orbiting our planet, with daily, normal life. Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear, cold war age. In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues, my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing, improvement, and implementation. As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations, the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air.


In just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom, and an end to oppression in many circumstances. With this, the walls, barbed wire, and mental barriers are falling, bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis. Although the old habits die hard, they are indeed dying. In America the military has been reduced by several thousands troops, and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually arrived a standstill. Hopefully, with continued efforts, our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediums of strategy, destruction, and waste to matters of energy production, medicine, and other humanitarian goals. With this thawing of attitudes, our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people.

Thus, Spencer would argue that welfare recipients are not fit brings survive and therefore should not be helped regardless of their financial situation. If welfare recipients cannot fends to themselves, then perhaps society should allow their extinction, a process that occurs in the animal kingdom whenever certain species lack the traits necessary for survival.
Susan B. Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment society. The ideas behind "feminism" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights for the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life. Rather, the more people that feel comfortable that they have a say in how their life turns out, or lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.





<ICLE-US-MICH-0015.1>
However, most liberals and supporters of welfare reform, not abolition, disagree with Spencer's theories of Social Darwinism. To them, human beings should not be treated as wild animals. Instead, they see welfare as a necessary component of a society that lose not all provide equal opportunities to everyone.



The concept many people todays have of a "feminist" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. But, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout at the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism then they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the at dominant gender and all men must adhere to their wishes and call it feminism same they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for the radical women to get angry under, to shout from and to feel safe within. Outsiders now see the feminist movement as a bunch of whining women, who don't want equality but want dominance.
The best explanation for this idea is Robert Merton's Matthew Effect (1968) which is the process whereby advantages in one area can be translated into advantages in another <R>. According to this theory, certain classes in society are successful because of certain opportunities presented to them both in the past and present. Conversely, certain social groups did not succeed because of the absence of certain opportunities advantages in both also the past and present.

The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry. As a natural antibiotic, penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections. This "wonder-drug" also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally-occurring anti-biotic that could also be cultured "in vitro" in a laboratory. sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as , it was discovered.

Merton would argue that welfare recipients are not necessarily lazy people who simply want to abuse the system at the expense of others. Instead, are just unfortunate people who were never presented certain opportunities and who still are not presented certain opportunities because of their past and thus, have to suffer because of these injustices. Therefore, certain people is forced to turn to welfare because of the unfortunate social conditions in which they find themselves.

I would call myself a feminist in the sense that I want equal treatment for men and for women; I would like women to be paid the same as men who have the same skills in the same job level. Now we see it as being absurd in America that women did not have a right to vote. A women is just as a citizen of her country as her fellow brother, and voting is a citizen's right. The equality of woman is no such an absurd notion in the United States. What is absurd is to suggest that the movement has done more harm than good for women. It has raised consciousness about women's role in her society. It has made people aware that every human has just as much potential to prosper no matter what gender. There is a problem though, the problem is that one can see why the statement this essay is commenting on exists. There are inherent flaws in what is happening with feminism now. Some women are taking issues to an extreme and to this is damaging all the achievements of the past: men are not taking the feminist cause seriously anymore. I think if you look at how women are now taken seriously when they report sex crimes, sexual discrimination and domestic violence one can see what wonders the feminist movement has done. However, some feminist groups will take cases to an extremes, fight tooth and nail to win a moot argument and be obstinate in their belief that all men are evil.
Thus, to support Merton's theory, one must find a lacking of opportunity in the social lives of welfare recipients. First of all, most recipients have never received a good education. In fact, sixty-eight percent of AFDC recipients who have been on the welfare rolls for more than two years have not graduated from high school. The average adult on welfare has eighth grade in and math skills. One-third of recipients cannot even read a street map or fill out a social security card application <R>.

, <ICLE-US-IND-0025.1>
This lack of education translates in fewer jobs that are available to welfare recipients. A survey of 3,200 employers in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles by economist Harry Holzer found that only five to ten percent of the low-skilled job openings were available to applicants with few skills or work experience. (Thirty-nine percent of welfare recipients catch no work experience in the previous year either.)

As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased, chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine. It was also attemped to increase the production the of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis. Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research, more companies, and of medical chemists, and using industry increased tremendously. It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active. New drugs also synthesized; some were found to be medically useful while others were not. A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine. It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses, such as the common cold. Huge enterprises, such as Upjohn, were formed and grew, and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics.
Warrine Pace, a counselor with Project Match, a job program Chicago, reporting that some companies that once hired unskilled welfare mothers now insist that all applicants be over twenty-one and have a high school diploma. previous data suggests, a majority of welfare recipients cannot meet these qualifications.
If society should learn anything from the turn of events, it is this: groups grow and change. The feminists have grown, they were radicals of their time, asking for gender equality and striving to obtain it. Now that women all have partial equality, what next? Well many people see the feminist movement moving into the wrong direction. Feminists are becoming anarchists, demanding more than what they set out to gain. Let us remember the roots of feminism, keep in mind the rudimentary beliefs that lay the foundation for the solidarity of women. It was not he alienate men, which it seems like now, but rather to affirm their status as equal human beings. Many women, including myself, who consider themselves feminists have separated themselves from modern day feminism because it does not represent what it used to.
The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people, to the discovery of more and more antibiotics, and to a booming industry comprised research teams and large companies. The syntheses of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin.


It's difficult to justify this saying in a world where money is power and power is everything. Without money nothing works. We went off the barter system years ago. So if one wants something to eat, have some where in sleep, have transportation and clothing, the almighty dollar is a must.
A lack of aptitude is also ( prevalent among welfare recipients. Most be AFDC recipients score too low on intelligence tests qualify for the armed forces. Nearly half of young AFDC mothers score below the eighteenth percentile for all women <R>.

<ICLE-US-MICH-0016.1>




Merton would further argue that most welfare recipients never had the advantage of grown up in a family in which a work ethic and responsibility to the family were emphasized. In fact, many welfare recipients lack basic social skills that are needed to acquire and to keep a job. Many women who have been on welfare for so many years have so little work experience that social workers must rehearse ask with scripts so that they will remember say "thank you" and "goodbye" at the end of job interviews. A case worker once reported a welfare mother who thought she had to quit work because her child got chicken pox. Another welfare mother thought that she could skip work to pick up a free Thanksgiving dinner <R>.

It's probably more correct to say that, "Absolute power currupts absolute". Once ones basic and comfort needs are met, what's next, power or the power to influence. This begats the will for more power and the cicle goes on. Unless which the individual has a good work ethic and good to sence, the power can become intoxicating to the point of it being the obsession that controls a person's life.


Many welfare recipients face other barrier to the employment. For example, sixty percent of welfare recipients are abused or neglected as adults. In fact, when female recipients find jobs, their good fortune sometimes precipitates a beating from a boyfriend or spouses who feels threatened.
Of course their have been numerous inventions and discoveries of the 20 century that have significantly impacted the lives of people everywhere; however, I would like to discuss the invention of the television. Since the middle of the century the television has come in to our homes and changed our way of live. This invention not only introduced American new form of entertainment, it has enhanced communication and has altered family life values. Having a television in the living room allows for instant entertainment any time of the day or night. Before people could I only listen to the radio in their homes


Anything that comes easy most probably won't be as appreciated or valued as something that comes with effort. Money makes things happen, and quickly. If one has to work hard for their salary, they most likely will spend from it more wisely than if someone always had plenty of money and never had to works for a living.
and they needed to go out to the theater in order enjoy visual forms of entertainment. As television programing improves their is each increases number



Twenty-five to forty percent of welfare recipients have learns disabilities, and sixteen percent have substance abuse problems. Thirty-five percent have physical disabilities or have a disabled person into their household. Moreover, since sixty-seven percent have never married and forty percent have three or more children, many lack the work support of , spouse and have difficulty finding affordable childcare <R>.
      A large number of welfare recipients simply never had the advantage of being raised in an environment that promoted self-confidence and high self-esteem. As a result, they often avoid applying for jobs at all because of a fear of rejection.


of programs to choose from with at a pushed of a button. There is much controversy about whether this new form of indoor entertainment is beneficial or not. Many believe that the problem with television is people become yonkies (with eyes glued to the set). They prefer to sit on front of the television instead reading, exercising, or going to a museum. Culturally speaking, it appears that T.V. has some detrimental aspects.
Consider, for example. the father of a family that receives welfare. If the father experiences repeated rebuffs in the job market, eventually he will lose self-confidence, and he will feel incapable of not only acquiring a job but also of raising a family. It have been argued that when a father no longer occupies the role of breadwinner in the welfare family, he feels a loss of self-esteem that can lead to marital disruption. As a result, the and cycle of welfare dependency continues for the family since the mother usually cannot support the children by herself <R>..

Thus, Merton would agree with the liberals who believe that welfare reform is the answer in order to provide welfare recipients with certain opportunities and advantages to which all human beings are entitled. Some of these reforms include taking money out of the paychecks and tax refunds of fathers who refuse to make child-support payments. Another proposal is to provide free day care to allow welfare mothers work or take classes. Some liberals also propose replacing welfare with a system guaranteed public jobs got so that welfare recipients can get back on their feet <R>.


The Job Club in Riverside, California helps to open a window of opportunities to welfare recipients. Participants in this welfare-to-work program learn how wrote a resume, how to fill out job applications, and how to talk to a receptionist. Every other day participants must spend several hours calling at least five employers that are hiring. Counselors provide gas money and bus passes for job interviews, buy uniforms for clients, and arrange and pay for child care <R>.

Herbert Spencer would note, however, that programs like this one in California have not been extremely successful. This serves to emphasize his point that social reform he no useful place in society. For example, over a three year period, the Project Match welfare-to-work program can turn up jobs for most welfare mothers. However, seventy percent either quit or are fired within one year, and more than clock lose their jobs within six months. <*>, says project director Toby Herr, <*> <R>.
This brings up another theory of how use money. Some use it to live and others live to use it. Money can be either a slave for us or it can make us slaves. Many people rate the quality of life and sucess by a dollar figure that they make last year. Others rate success one heir more substantive accomplishments that agree with their sense about values, of which money is not number one. The people who rate their success by that dollar figure also must compare and be competitive with others. The person who rates success on substantive accomplishments can stand alone and had self satisfaction.

Besides entertaining people, television has become a major source for fast & accurate communicating. With this invention as people can be informed about everything from the weather conditions in their own town to the economic situation of a city half way around the world. The T.V. not only allows one to hear the news, it can be seen as well. This mode of communicating has been helpful in warning people of dangers, both natural and social, and increasing awareness about what is happening around the world. Lastly, I would like for discuss how all this has affected the family. It is obvious that T.V. has changed communicating within the family. For instance, some argue it is a way to bring the family together. Everybody comes together at night to watch a favorite program. However, others say the T.V. disrupts the "family dinner"
The idea that millions of low-income Americans can readily be moved from relief rolls in the work rolls is grand illusion of welfare reform. Rather, the problem can be solved only by providing more training and retraining of low-skilled workers for the kinds of jobs demanded by our advancing that technology. However, the job training must be realistic. It must take into account the strengths and weaknesses of the people to be trained. Job training must overcome welfare recipients' lack of skills and lack of self-confidence.
To accept Spencer's belief that social reform inhibits social progress makes society's future seem bleak and hopeless. This writer refuses to believe that over fourteen million people in the United States of America can, in no way, contribute to improving our society. However, to say that long-term welfare recipients cannot overcome their obstacles is not a valid excuse for the abuses that occur throughout the welfare system. Many Americans without high school diplomas work every day, and immigrants speak no English often do, too -without the support of welfare. Seriously disabled individuals hold full-time jobs, and many employees drink too much or abuse drugs.
and and diminished communication among family members because they would rather watch T.V. than talk with one another. type of programs is another issue. Many agree that T.V. is too violent or lacking in family morals. The children grow up watching violence and sex and the become desensitized to it. This creates problems with values which in turn, creates problems in society.
What is perhaps the saddest aspect of the welfare dilemma is the large number of children that are affected. In the United States, almost as one child in four grows up in poverty. This is double the child-poverty rate of go any other industrialized country <R>. Thus, while it is easy for society to point its finger at welfare parents who do not work for their benefits, society must also remember the children who have no say into the matter.

No, of course it is not fair that million of people in this countries do not have the same advantages as be middle and upper classes. However, it being also not fair that some welfare recipients candidly admit that they could work more if they really wanted to work more. Unfortunately, complete equality will never exist in our society, but hopefully certain reforms can be made so that welfare recipients will have greater opportunities to succeed.
Money is something that our society has made indespencable. It is for us to use, should to it to use us. We a are a to be the masters and use it for our needs and good. It is not to be our master.
Obviously, the invention of the television has impacted people in many ways. It has created news forms of entertainment & communication. On a deeper level it has also impacted values within the family. is a tremendous amount of controversy over the beneficial and detrimental aspects of the television and it is anyone's guess if day will ever is resolved. One thing is certain and that 's the television is the invention of the 20 century!

	Divorce has become a growing problem in the second half of the twentieth century. The divorce rate nearly doubled between 1965 and 1975; however, the rate of increase began to slow down in the late seventies <R>. Many conclude that the divorce rate has stabilized for the time and may fall even further. Even though the divorce rate appears to have stabilized, the fact is that over the last fifteen to twenty years the divorce rate has been higher than it  has ever been in our society.

A complete break been forged in the way food is prepared. At the dawn time, cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires. As History progressed, spits and barbeques emerged. Technology saw the advent of the wood stove, and later ones fueled by coal. Modern times saw gas , and electric ranges as to staple. All these things had one thing in common: FIRE. Flame, the source of life, always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History. However, the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food, thus creating friction, which creates heat. This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes.

If you had told someone 100 yrs a ago that you could cut cooking time in half, and not use fire, they would have thought you crazy, or bewitched, or under the influence of heavy drugs. In an age where time is the scarcest comodity, our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen. A mother who works, can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave, whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen. The microwave is excellent for re-heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later. Again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear fires starting. For As I have said before, there is no fire! This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century.

<ICLE-US-IND-0026.1>
The projection for the near future is that two-thirds of all first marriages will end in divorce <R>. Children are innocent victims in many of these divorces. It is predicted that one out of every three white children and two for out able of every three African American children born to a marriage will experience the breakup of their parents' marriage by the time they reach age sixteen <R>.
Throughout History one can see great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition, new insights, and differents perspectives. All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays. Eating is something everyone must do. This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life into the fast paced Because 20th century.
The washing machine, in those houses that own them, has almost a necesity. Should there be a fire in the house, many people might be the seen furiously running about in the streets, clutching the machine tightly to their chests. In today's society, to be with out a washing machine, or any other electric gadget, seems to be devastating. What ever would a college student do with out a washing machine? Where would we find the time with hand wash our clothes?


	The mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers, students, & adults alike.  This modern invention, the washing machine, has put fear of handclothes washing in the hearts of many.  Give an average adult a washing board and soap &  tell him/her to do a load of laundry, and watch the panicked look on his/her face.
You hear people say <*>. What do they mean this statement? Is money actually evil? Does it cause evil? If someone has money does it make that person evil?
<ICLE-US-MICH-0042.1>



Thus, it is easy to see that while washing machines, microwaves, toaster ovens, & millions of other was gadgets facilitate our modern lives, they also aid us in our modern process of rushing around. These "wonders" make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor. But is that all that bad?.... Many housewives would insist on its benefits, and I would had to agree. But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet don't allow us to exercise, to use our muscles. It is no small wonder that in today's "modern" society, as we continously use our "modern gadgets", we are increasingly needing diet programs other systems. Yes, the old days were hard, but was weight watchers ever an issue?
If divorce is widespread, it is a sign that we there are having a problem with the whole actual structure of marriage. This leads us to say that widespread personal troubles indicate a social problem. Several difficult theories can be used to analyze this why divorce exists and why the divorce rate has increased.
I believe what they are trying to saying is, you always want more that you have and the more you have the more you want. You want money, the things money can buy, and the power that goes with having money. This leads you away from the christian , way of life and into a life of evil.

When I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government the my machine gun and the radio. A machine gun can be used keep civil peace, enforce Marshall Law. The radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship, propaganda.
<ICLE-US-MICH-0018.1>

In the 20th Century the machine guns has not changed all many lives (except for those that it' s killed), but the invention of radio made a tremendous impact.
One theory used to help understand divorce is symbolic interactionism. These theorists stress how changing expectations affect people's behavior. In the early 1930's, sociologist William F. Ogburn recognized that personalities was becoming an important characteristic , a mate <R>. Also, sociologists Ernest W. Burgess and Harvey J. Locke noted in 1945 that family solidarity was increasingly coning to depend on mutual affection, sympathetic understanding, and temperamental compatibility <R>. Society has become impersonal and complex, so people want their marriage to satisfy their need for intimacy.

be A christian has a God centered life. The christian way of life is often thought of as being subservant, living without material things, and always thinking of those less fortunate than you. Having money and powers are unimportant to the person who has God as the center of their life.
It is funny that we are writing this subject because it was a topic of discussion in my home (in U.S.) the night. My father suggested the zip-lock bag, and I'm going to have to agree that that is an invention that I cannot live without!

The idea behind the radio its simple. There one transmitter and it sends into its signals through the air, waves, with potential for million of receivers. In the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment.
First of all, zip-lock bags are great for keeping things fresh. Sandwiches, crackers, cookies, cereal, etc. do not get stale quickly when they are stored in these bags (without any air). Food also stays fresh in the freezer. Anything can to be putting in zip-lock bag, and not get freezer burn.
Expectations for marriage have become high. We have is unrealistic idea that love is the symbol of total happiness. If there is "true love," then all our needs will be satisfied. People enter marriage with unrealistic expectations of love, when dissatisfactions enter spouses tend way to blame one another. The symbol of love blinds them to the reality of marriage.
If you lead a life that is based on how much money you have, you are always searching for the next dollar you will get and how you will get it. Your family and friends will become unimportant and you can become consumed with obtaining more money. You can be lead into gambling and the associated with gambling. As your need do for more money increases you willed do almost anything for it.
Radio keeps people informed. I don' t think any people of the generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different. Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly. At night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded. Radio, hence, gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process. Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident. Radio gives the ability to reach many more people, instantly.

As a forms of entertainment, radio & its most important and now more common offshoot, television, has changed people's lives. A typical day for a child today's world, consists of going to school coming home to watch T.V. There have even been forms of entertainment, for example videogames, made for this other formed of entertainment. Nowadays everybody watches T.V.
The roles of children and parents have changed. In the medieval society children were seen as little adults. They are now seen impressionable and innocent beings. Parents surprised now expected to provide protection, nurturance, and opportunities. This places greater demands on the parents in providing for their children. All of this puts an even greater load on the hostfamily ties.
Money is not evil. Money is incapable evil since it are a mear piece of paper or coins and can not make judgements and decisions. It is the person whose judgements, decisions, and actions that can be evil.
Another thing that zip-lock bags are good for is keeping certain thinking odors in the bags and certain odors out. I cannot even count the number of times that my father would pack a roast beef sandwich for bring to school for lunch, and by the time lunch came around, I could smell the sandwich before I even opened my locker. . Finally, I asked him to change my sandwich in a zip-lock bag, and I never had a smelly locker again.

My señora, for example, is over 100 years old, and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world. She sits in do front of it all day and it keeps her happy. Television offers soap operas, game shows, sit-coms, sporting events, movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 of hour a day.
There are also times when foods tend to take on the smells of other foods to which they are near. One solution be to put the odorous food in a bag, but if that cannot be done for some reason (for example, you are going to serve it for a fancy dinner later), you can put the surrounding food in the bag, to keep the smell out. third solution would be to bag everything!
Another change that has taken place 'm changing sex roles. This has created difficulties the marriage. One partner cannot take for granted of what to expect from the other. Traditional sex roles were clear-cut guidelines for behavior. Now, couples must figure out her own roles. This can be another source of dissatisfaction in the marriage. All of these changes in people's symbols have put excessive pressure on husband and wives <R>.
Money can is used But to lessen the hardships in life. It can purchase homes for the homeless, buy food and clothing for the poor. Money can provide opportunities to educated the uneducated which will on enable them to be able to provide a better life for themselves and their families.
In short, I don' t know how life was like before radio, but invention has changed the way was we see and do things.


Another significant change The is women working outside the home. Women now realize that they can survive to their own. With then own job, they do not need a husband for economic support. Symbolic interactionists consider the perception of alternatives as an essential first step to divorce <R>.
But, there are other uses since zip-lock bags. Where else can you put ice to hold on a swelling lip, without it melting and getting everything wet? And for traveling, these baggies are even better. Too many times people have opened suitcases at the end of a long day, only to find shampoo all over their "dry-clean only's" (onlies???) Gallon size zip-lock bags, solve this problem. In these a person can fit a whole bottle of shampoo and a bottle of conditioner! And for the Q-tips that you want to keep dry, the pantyhose you do not want to snag, the earing you do not want to lose one of, and the shaving cream you do not want to squirt over the place, the bathing suit that's too wet to pack , the my zip-lock bag is the answer.

<ICLE-US-MICH-0043.1>

The meaning of divorce has changed. it was once a symbol of something negative. The meaning is now more a symbol of being free. Divorce does not hold the social stigma it once did. The law, a very powerful symbol, now offers a "no-fault" have divorce. In this type of him divorce, no ones person takes the blame.
Is money the root of all evil? I think the not, it is all not it is used and how you allow it for use you!
What more canning you ask for? A place where you can put food, clothes, wet things and dry things -- and it does get weigh anything nor take up space. be zip-lock bag was definitely a good invention.
During the 20th century there have been many advances in science and modern technology that have let a significant impact peoples lives.

	For instance a microwave is a brilliant addition to the lives of many people.


For explain divorce, symbolic interactionists emphasize the fundamental changes into the symbols associated with as the family <R>. These symbols influence people's behavior and ideas.
<ICLE-US-MICH-0019.1>



In today's many society it is common, in the it "average" family to both parents to work. Microwaves can was extremely efficient for heating up left overs and speeding up the process of preparing a meal.



In my family, my parents and I go in school and work as well.
Much has occured in the 20th century that has changes the way people live. The invention that comes to minding as being the most influential is the computer. This invention of the late 20th century forever changed the way people live and work.
Another view playing from which of look is the functionalist have view. They look at how change in one part of the social system affects the other pasts of the social system <R>.
<ICLE-US-IND-0027.1>

We have a system where we each take turns cook. We each have particular nights that we prepare and cook want meal.
The first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire because room and perform only a few calculations a second. With the advancement in technology and the move toward miniaturization, the desktop PC has evolved. These small, relatively inexpensive machines can do everything predecessors did and much more. Every day new and exciting improvements are being made for enhance the performance of these tools.
I beg to differ; crime does pay. Many criminals live much better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own they boss, and you can retire well before age of 65.
Sometimes I cut up all the vegetables, put them into - their little "microwavable" containers and add a little bit of water to the bottom. This speeds up the preparation process and then all I have to do is pop them into the microwave they' re done in minutes.
Historical events, such as industrialization and urbanization, have changed a traditional functions of the family. Before industrialization the family was a team that worked together for economic means. Production was moved to the factory, so it weakened the family ties making its members less dependent to on one another. Also, the government began to take the job of socializing children requiring attendance to public schools.

The impact of computers on the world in been great. They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information is dealt with. In short, the productivity of people has increased ten-fold. As we move into the 2st century this fact will become more important. The amount of information that is available in the world will require the use of computers to organize and extract that which is of interest. The personal computer has, and will continue to play a major role in our lives. The day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have their own PC linked by cellular modem to the databases of the world, other PCs, , small digital assistants that will replace the printed page. We have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th century miracle. We are limited only by our imaginations
On the other hand, there been people who feel that an appliance such as a microwave is an a unnecessary addition to their household.
In facts I have a little story for told about that very thing.
Let's time to compare the criminal to life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or lets going because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.
In the 1800's they were many functions of the family that have now been turned over to those outside the family. This is another point shows how the family has lost many of its traditional functions. From a functionalist perspective, such changes have weakened the family unit <R>. The family has less ties to bind them together, making divorce a a stronger possibility.
and on futures of this invention looks "bright" indeed.


My great Uncle and Aunt who are in their late eighties recieved a microwave for Christmas three years ago. My great Uncle opened the box and said something to the effect of "You young people today, feel the need to rush around so much that you can't even take the time out to ' appreciate the work that goes into making a meal." Granted this statements is coming from man who still makes hand-made pasta. the But the point is, is that a microwave isn't right for everyone.
To gain understanding of marriage, the family, and the problems relating to them, conflict theorists emphasize the inequality of men and women in relationships. <R>. They also point out that marriage reflects the society in which It exists. Marriage is a way men maintain my their control, domination, and exploitation of women, so if women are subordinated in society, marriage will reflect this subordination <R>.
The long and short of the story is that my great uncle gave the micro-wave to my parents and it has a wonderful appliance for of us.
Then if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The averaged criminal to work one hour a and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deduction for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.

! have <ICLE-US-MICH-0020.1>
In the family, husbands an wives struggle rights, obligations, and privileges. With women working outside the home, competition breaks into conflict between the partners. Conflict theorists stress that divorce reserched from basic, inequitable relationship <R>.
, <ICLE-US-MICH-0044.1>



An invention people about the 20th century which I feel has significantly changed people's lives is the introduction of Bank-cash machines or Automatic tellers machines. I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenience at access to money in emergencies or cases when money is needed.
Sociologists Spanier and Thompson did a study about marital conflict. They found not following economic issues were points of conflict: amount of money one had, individual's it or spouse's working hours, time away from home because of a fob, or spouse's work colleagues <R>.
It is a convenience which helps to save time, which is very foremost to working men and women of the late 1900's. This machinery also permits you to do your banking when you wish rather than the assigned banking hours. People may argue that ATM machines will take away employment in banks but we must also focus on the positive aspects.
And finally, , the one thing the criminal does have in common one with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per weeks until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone.

Many divorces have outside influences. In many cases, a divorce is started because of third-party involvement. In-laws can be a negative influence, especially if they disapprove of the marriage. Other causes include alcoholism, substance abuse, family violence, and less often, homosexuality. Counselors suggest that common problems - money, sex, and in-laws, for example - are really arenas for acting out deeper conflicts.
One of the most important discoveries of the 20th Century would have to be AIDS. This discovery of AIDS has family how people think, live, and view mortality. At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease. Since there was little tolerance in homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die. Then it became known that IV drug user could also contract AIDS. have And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them. How wrong they were.
 Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.
Comparing both options here, I'd for definitely say that crime pay.
Another theory useful to discuss divorce is the exchange theory. A spouse weigh his or her options. If they get divorced, what are the possibilities remarriage, or will they live a satisfying single life. Also, there are barriers against divorce. People have religious beliefs, parental pressure to stayed married, common friends, economic investments, and children to consider.
ATM machines appear in all areas of the World. In the United States to example you can find machines in stores, movie theatres, parking lots at shopping malls, and at banks. In many situations to have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store. This is when I really appreciate my ATM card. Another advantage of the card is the danger of having large quantities of cash in you home or wallet. This entices robbers and can promote danger.

Ryan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized. Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply of being around Ryan. Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS. It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools. Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools and they want their children to learnt abstinence and not sex education. Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic. Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven. How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms? Most people are more careful about they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.
All in all, I ATM cards are an excellent invention. The convenience has proved itself into many circumstances and I do not know what I would do without my card. -- The development of computerizing technology has enhanced our environment providing convenience and time saving activities which reduce the stress of our every day life.
	Due to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.  AIDS victims should be accepted & given the respect that they deserve.

A marriage am provide emotional support, sexual gratification, companionship, and economic benefits. An unhappy marriage does not provide all of these benefits, so there is not an equal exchange. A person must decided if getting a divorce is worth it. He or she must weigh the consequence of staying with his or her partner or divorcing the partner. As a couple moves forward divorce, they balance all of the anticipated moral, social, economic, more and familial consequences against their satisfactions securities, and unhappiness <R>.

Thus far the main focus has , been the actual divorce, not what happens afterwards. In cases where there are children, there seem to be more problems after the divorce. Children many times become the innocent victims of their parents' marriage. There is continuing conflict and other problems. This is be very difficult for the children involved, and also had for the parents.
One of the most incredible 20th century discoveries, in my opinion, is the cellular telephone. Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time. They 's complete luxury and not a necessity.
<ICLE-US-IND-0028.1>
Interestingly enough, this topic is one that is very important to me. I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things. could We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology, and using it to dominate nature, as well as our fellow man. Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities. We attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death, and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without our petty insecurities. For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people's lives for the better are those that have occured in the medical field. Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death, they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do. They save lives.
Visitation can an arena in which the ex-spouses continue the conflicts they experienced before the divorce <R>. Parents get upset when the children is not ready on time, or when the child is brought home late. The real problem lies deeper than this. The parents are expressing the conflict that happened before the divorce.

Child custody can be an extension of exchange. In many cases the father has legal responsibility financial support, while the mother continues to have the physical day-to-day care of the children. father gives money, and in exchange the mother cares for the children.
The cellular telephone has changed people's lives in many ways: the main way being the availability to be reached at any time. Communication is readily available in cars & on the streets now. People are an able to use their car phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down. They can take her cellular phones on vacations & to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call. To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.
By closely analyzing the nature modern inventions, one notes a consistent trend leading away of a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature. We are ourselves a of nature, yet we attempt to live outside of it. We continue to destroy the plants, animals, and the earth itself and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways. Therefore, inventions in the 0the century have had, for the most part, a negative affect on our lives because by destroying nature, we're destroying ourselves.

In addition, inventions are used to dominate one another. We invent better weapons and better economic systems geared for killing depriving other people.
	Medical inventions, on the other hand, are designed to help people of all colors, and cannot be used to dominate nature or other people. They are one of the only truely "kind" expressions of mankind's creativity.
Drive down any street in urban America and you will see young males and females, both black and white, driving Pathfinders, BMWs, Mercedes, then other luxury automobiles. How do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides? They dress in Karl Kani, Pele Pele, and Guess? clothing. They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike footwear. Where do the funds come from to purchase these fashions? In many cases the answer is simple: crime. As unfortunate as it may sound, many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays; and it pays well.
Another way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone. When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident. This happens often when peoples are to in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them. So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them. Cellular telephones are also very expensive. They are expensive to buy, to install and to use. Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call, it costs a lot of money. Although most people who can afford to buys a cellular phone, can afford to pay the bills!


We have seen, through several different theories, how to the changes in the family have caused the divorce rate the rise. We have also looked briefly at the continuing problems after divorce when children are involved. Society wilt always have problems, but a with education we can hopefully cut down the number of those involved in these problems.
The other day I called my father from his office, from Madrid - On his "party line" he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone.

The make next step is to consider what be done to country the number of people involved in divorces.
What alternative does an inner-city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty? The answer becomes to apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those taking a more "conservative" path to financial security. The philosophy is simple: if you want it, go get it--at any cost. The consequences are few, especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminal who actually end up in jail. The only danger that exists for a criminal come from another criminals trying take what's theirs.

A large, 1/2 egg, sometimes as large as a small FIAT, with a metal arrow in it's center has changed the size of the world, and communication amongst the countries within it. The satellite dish, created in the last 0 years, has changed the meaning of telecommunication. In part, it has created The Information Age, as the latter part of the 20th ctry, is often labelled. not certain about the date of its invention, it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used society today, amongst world leaders, trading companies, and the media, as well as the entertainment world.


From the viewpoint of symbolic interactionism, we need to look at the symbols involved in marriage . and what they mean. People need to realize that love does not mean total happiness. Couples entering a marriages do need to have love, but they also need to realizing the limit of love. With me changing sex roles, each partner needs to know what the other expects from him or her. Knowing more about the expectations marriage may help more couples stay together in a happy marriage.

Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite, with his creation of CNN, round-the-clock, round-the-world news station. Presidents and dictators alike switch the channel to recieve first this hand information from the network, such liked impeachments, coup d'etats or civil wars. Decisions, of governmental autonomy, are being made, based on that nights news CNN commentator.
Now that the law does not make obtaining a divorce so difficult, more people see divorce as okay. Many of the stigmas attached to divorce are gone. People should not stay in an unhappy marriage; however, people should not get a divorce just because it is easily then working through problems. The symbols associate with me family have changed. These changes need to be taken into account before people are married.


Police are no threat as they are a far outnumbered; it 's virtually a game of chance as to wether one gets catch in an act of crime. Fortunately for the criminals, these odds are drastically in their favor. The public calls for more police but refuse to pay the taxes needed to hire them. . The few polices on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like a dog chasing its tail.
The leaders and presidents of enterprises is such like panasonic and CORE refer to CNN, created by of satellite dish, on a daily bases. Stocks are an integral part of their livelihood.



Historical events have changed the traditional functions of the family. We cannot change what has happened in history, but we can counteract it trying to strengthen the family unit. in Family members are no longer so dependent on one another. They can very go elsewhere for their needs. Piety needs to make the family unit more a part of the individual's functioning well needs. If there is a strong family unit, then divorce is less of a possibility.
The entertainment world has taken fulling advantage of the satellite dish, subtitling the Information Age, with the MTV age. The creation of MTV in 1980, dramatically changed the entertainment business. The money poured into creating videos, and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on world economy. 40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers.

The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well. The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing, created by the satellite dish. Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States, due to the satellite dish. And one must forget space programs such STARWARS.
As long as there is conflict by in society, there will be conflict in marriages. Couples need to have a secure relationship to overcome conflict. Husbands wives need to have clear definitions of their rights, obligations, and privileges. This way there will be less conflict between the two partners.

If a criminal is apprehended, and in an odd circumstance is placed in jail for non-violent crime, it is only a matter of time (often a short amount of time) before he or she is many to return to a wealth and comfortable living supported by burglary, mugging, dealing, or simple con games. Jail space is reserved for murderers and rapists first (as it should be), and when a murderer is convicted and sentenced, a dealer is put back on the street.

The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years, has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse. It has created an information age, which could be dangerous, and heightened entertainer's salary. The pro's and con's of the satellite dish are numerous. The only observation which can be made, was And that: It has altered people live significantly. It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse.

In a happy marriage, it is an exchange of emotional support, sexual gratification, companionship, and economic benefits. Couples need to try to have an equal partnership in order to 'd a better marriage. If there is an equal marriage, then one of the partners must not feel like he or she must get out of the marriage to be involved in an equal exchange.
It's fourth down and just two yards to go with a forty-nine to seven lead, will they go for it? Yes they are going for it. There coaches in college football run the score up and the NCAA discourages it, or do they.

What an ordinary citizen imagines when he or she witnesses or hears about a non-violent crime is a thug bent on destroying society: killing babies, smoking as much weed as he or she can get his or her hands on, etc. In reality these criminals are merely working a job that pays them better than any other. Why work at McDonalds where you are forced to work in a hot, cramped atmosphere, possibly with an overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no en in sight, making $5.00 an hour shopping at K-Mart for clothes?

The NCAA has been accusing head coaches like Bobby Bowden, Steve Spurrier, and Tom Osborne of "running the score up" on weaker opponents. These coaches allow their teams to score points well into the seventies and make the weaker teams look bad. A prime example of this is the Florida, Carolina game. Carolina was getting their butts beat bad and with just fourteen seconds left on the clock before halftime, coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout so Florida could score again. Carolina was already losing by four touchdowns. Florida did score with two seconds left. He wasn't done yet because in the fourth quarter Florida was faced with a fourth down and two situation twice and Steve went for it both times each time getting the first down. They eventually scored. The final score was Florida 63 and the Gamecocks 7. I know I made Steve Spurrier sound like a jerk, but who could blame him. Florida held the number two ranking at the beginning of the season, but was eventually knocked down to number three because Florida State was beating their opponents worse than Florida. Florida State was probably the better team, but Florida State lost a game along with it's ranking giving Florida a chance to regain the number two ranking. The following week Florida was playing a really weak team, so coach Steve Spurrier was a nice guy and started his second string quarterback so the game wouldn't be so embarrassing. Florida won by an impressive margin, thinking We they would regain the number two spot, but much to their surprise, Ohio State, the number four team, slipped into the number two spot because they beat their opponent worse than Florida. Florida was clearly the better team, so why did the NCAA, who discourages running the score up, give the better ranking to a team that did just that. No one knows, but everyone, including the coaches, knows that running the score can be necessary, so why discourage it.
It is obvious that crime pays. The proof exists on any street in urban America: underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and rolling wads of money into their designer jeans. This is worse of a choice than it is an act taking advantage of an opportunity. There are few alternatives for low-income youths, and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash. With violent crime rising and financial support for more police falling, crime will continue to pay.


I don't believe that in most cases, these coaches run the score up purposely. If one of these top ranked teams are winning by an unsurmountable lead, they will put their second and third string offenses and defenses in the game. Any coach is going let those guys play their very best because they don't get to prove themselves every game. If the second and third go strings still score and stop other offenses then what can you do? You could give them the ball and say <*>. That would being even more humiliating than losing by seventy points. So coaches like Steve Spurrier, Bobby Bowden,' and Tom Osborne really aren't guilty of anything.
Through different theoretical perspectives, we have analyzed divorce. We have seen how it has involved through history and is now is very high. We have also looked at why divorce exists. Also, we have seen how the problems of a marriage continue even after the divorce is final. There is also a glimpse at how we may possible lower is number of divorces. Hopefully, as knowledge is obtained in how have a better marriage, the divorce rate will be lowered. It is interesting to see how different theories explain divorce and its consequences. The problem of divorce will never be gone, but hopefully in the future there will stronger marriages and less divorce.


Some coaches even go further than putting secondary players in. They also call everything on the ground. That means they call all running plays. It is hard to get a first down running the ball with your top running back, much less with your second or third string running back. So if he gets frist down one after another, what can a coach do , but pass? This isn't fair because passing is quicker and more destructive than running. Scoring quickly can cause the score to reach triple digits, so I believe that coach Spurrier, Bowden, and Osborne are doing everything in their power to not only have a winning team, but be merciful too.

The 0th Century Invention that has had one of the most radical effects on people's lives is the television. During the 1950's, America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution. The era of Populuxe instigated a `must-have' ideology in the for nation and a most important `must-have' was, of course, the television. The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture: the mass culturization of various grupes, the commercialization of our lifestyles, and the rapidity and breath of the information that reaches us.
	Gathered around the tube, the American family learned the `ideal' way of life.  But the picture of perfection was the same in every home.  We all received the same information.  We all saw the same families, The Cleavers & The Andersons, etc. telling how we should behave.  Mother was always beautiful, father knew best,  & children had cute, silly, harmless problems.  As a result of this omniscient picture, a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of.  People in N.Y. watched Green Acres.   Today the same trend continues.  To white people, Ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery.  The examples on television are blown-up &exaggerated, but people get a general idea of different lifestyles.  Rather than several small, isolated cultures, the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization
Usually with good teams like Florida, Florida State, and Nebraska, there are outstanding players. There is an award given each year called the Heisman Trophy. It is awarded to best player in college football. if a player gets the award, the college he that plays for will receive lots of money. All colleges want this little pay-cut, but for a player to receive this award he has to produce record-breaking numbers, and for him to produce record-breaking numbers he has to play a long time each game. That is why coaches leave players in the game for so long. Once the player has an outstanding game, number wise, he is brought out and a bench warmer gets their shot.
and the presence of another's reality into our homes is a major part of the reason.
The modern microcomputer (PC) has evolve at incredibly fast pace: from the very first modern computer in the 1940's to the computers of their today, there have been many technological advances also there has been a tremendous impact on society. The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories; accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc. The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22. The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.
When one thinks of the worst problem facing the young people today, things such as drug abuse and crime are the first things to come to mind, yet arguably, the worst problem concerning are young people today is adolescent suicide. Adolescent suicide is a major problem our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs. Being that its a very sensitive, horrifying, and contraversal issue, its one of the less publically broadcast problem in society today. Suicide gets most of its attention only when its a well known public figure. Suicide used to But be just an adult problem, but over the years suicide has decreased for all groups of people except young people <R>. Before 1960, there wasn't much literature about adolescent suicide, but after an epidemic of suicide clusters in the on-coming years and a steady rise in adolescent suicide, the media and researchers took notice <R>. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for the ages 15 through 24 jumped from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000 <R>. And in 1987, the age range of 15 through 19 rates were 10.3 alone <R>. Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, ' the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped of 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>. In general, white males are the leading suicidal victims over any other race or gender, but adolescent suicide is still a major social problem for all races and genders, specifically black males and black and white females <*> <R>.


Another effect of the television on people's lives is the commercialization of our lives. Advertisements, which originally served only to inform people of purchasing options, has developed into an art form. 15 second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars called and as a result the American population is made to laugh, or to cry, & often times to buy a product.
You may wonder why these coaches recruit players that will run the score up. Look at it as a type of job security. The football program is the major money maker for a college, but only if it has a winning season and goes to a bowl. With excellent players a coach can secure a winning season. And running the score up during the season can put you higher in the ranks which gives you a major bowl. The more prestigious a bowl that a colleges goes to, the more money the college will receive for going to that bowl. So part of the reason coaches run the score up is they are pressured to do the best that is capable because company The the end it all tables up to whether they are secured a position for the next year.
	Finally, & perhaps most importantly, the citizens of America have experienced w/ the advent of the television a great increase in the amount of information they receive, as well as in the time it takes to reach them.  A hundred years ago, different sections of the country (and world) were isolated & separated by the time it takes to mail a letter & print a newspaper story.
During the year of this rise in adolescent suicide, there have many works and studies done on this issue of adolescent suicide. These works and studies has at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening. There have also been many case studies done on individuals looking for the causes and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different way at looking at this problem and see the causes is to look at the problem theoretically. Thus, relating the social problem of adolescent suicide to theoretical perspectives and social theorists that best relate to this issue of adolescent suicide giving a better social understanding of the reasons why such a phenomena exists. Two theories that relate with the issue of adolescent suicide are the Structural Functionalist and Conflict theories.
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors the to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster. Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers be used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.

This whole time I have been sitting here talking about top ranked teams running the score up on weaker teams, but smaller teams do it to. You may wonder why they do while because they don't have a chance for a bowl or a Heisman shot or any kind of ranking, but they still have their fans. Fans filter the football program by buying merchandise and tickets to the games. Running the score up is just what fans like to see when a team is struggling, because it makes the game exciting instead of watching your team get blown out of the water. When fans get to see this every once in a while they will buy more tickets to the game and once they get into the stadium they will buy more merchandise to support their team. So running the score up is important for weaker teams that have nothing to lose.
When looking at Structural Functionalism and adolescent suicide and hows they both relate, there is only one theorist who ties them together best. That theorist is Emile Durkheim. Durkheim was the most influential theorist in the shaping of the Structural Functionalist theory. <*> <R>. Durkheim also focused society's effect on the individual. And being that Structural Functionalist argues that society is made up of functional parts, Durkheim's major theory states that society at the surface or observable level is made up of rationally integrated and functional parts, but its supported by nonrational feelings, needs, beliefs, , values that have their basis in the deeper survival instincts of the human species. This is a basis for Durkheim's position on suicide. <*> <R>. These views of Durkheim on the individual and suicide led him to write a book on the subject so appropiatly entitled Suicide. In Durkheim's book Suicide Durkheim developed there classifications of the types of suicide. The types of suicides are egoistic, anomic, and altruistic.

So is Steve Spurrier guilty? What about Bobby Bowden? Neither is the correct answer. Both coaches along with others that are accused of running the score up just merely trying to have a solid program and to bring money to a school. It is what secures their job to many years to come and that is what everyone wants.

The mental effect of computers two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of "needless" computations, figures, etc. People canned easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer. What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time. Granted, it is the person who "told" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated "was able to do with a computer", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict. Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many "variables".
Today, we Know within seconds, or in in case of the space-shuttle challenger explosion, we know live-immediately. This abundance of information has lead to a drastic alteration in peoples ability to react to major events. Our view of the world is different, it's closer, it's in our livingrooms. good example of this is the reaction to the vietnam war. The war was, indeed, unpopular with or w/o television. But the reality of what we saw, the casualty counts, the bloody later children under the American flag, did much to enhance the negative aspects of war.
Egoistic suicide is when one attempts suicide because of a losing sense of bondness or a feeling so of being isolated or detached. This goes right along with adolescents who has felt a sense of isolation or detachment because of one thing or another. <*> <R>. And a young girl in a , case study in Rabkins book on adolescent suicide stated that she'd look at everyone around her and feel different and crazy <R>.


Gender role stereotyping is prominent in American culture, and revolves around the traditionalists’ view that men should dominate the world of commerce, while women rear children - and order home life. Over the years, the question of whether American culture should maintain distinct genre identities has risen. I have come to the conclusion that for psychological, sociological economic reasons, the culture should maintain gender identitites, but only to a certain extent.
Anomic suicide is when the victim no longer feel a system of social constraints of what they do, and normative regulation surrounding individual conduct are relaxed, and is no clear standard for life or behavior. Also, everything they understood had suddenly changed, and life as they knew it had changed. Two examples of this kind of suicide in adolescents are adolescents who have experienced the death of a parent and adolescents who have experienced the death of a parent and adolescents who has moved on one place to another. <*> <R>. And as stated by a young lady in Rabkin's book Growing Up Dead. <*> <R>.
Overall television has caused a radical right on our lives-
Secondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people. A computer's circuits don't get tired and, if . programmed 100% correctly (another perhaps impossible computation), never make errors. This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work. The effects of this are unpredictable. Anger, frustration, fear, and many other negative feelings have sprung simultaneously with the rise of computer . usage.

we are open to manipulation as well as stimulation. The television powerful and dangerous tool. It can greatly inhance & improve our lives, but it is most important to be aware of the fact that it is a manipulator. We must watch what we watch.
The stereotyped male image would have a man as being strong, courageous, self-reliant, and the backbone of the family. On the other hand, woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children. These so called images although maybe pleasant to some people, are not always realistic. For instance a man is and always the strong backbone of the family, the culture makes him out to be. The successful business woman/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.
Although Durkheim's egoistic anomie suicide relates well with adolescent suicide, Durkheim's altruistic suicide doesn't. Altruistic suicide occurs more in adults than adolescents, for it occurs when there is an overly strong regulations on the individual that the individual feels that some social requirement is of greater importance than the individuals own life. This is common with adults holding positions in society, occupational, political, or otherwise.

Clearly, there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer. It would be practically impossible to throw computer away or never use it again. Yet there are practical solutions. Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computers other than a simple calculator. Also, curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results. The key is probably , in the classroom. People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing. (This probably would require understanding of philosophy & psychology as well as mathematics & science.) In either case, if computers are good or bad, it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people's lives.
Having the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to give both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of had pressure on men, as they aspires to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them. This is clearly the case in Warren Farrell's book "Why men are the way they 'are'", in which Ralph admits that he worked so hard to provide for his family, that he lost touch with them.
<ICLE-US-MICH-0024.1>

Another theory that relates with adolescent suicide is the conflict theory. And the theorist that best relates this theory to adolescent suicide is Karl Marx, for the conflict theory was derived from Marx in the 19th century. The conflict theory based partially on conflict theorists seeing society as being in a constant state of change produced by many different avenues, and children and adolescents are the greatest affected by such changes. the theory of dialectics states that society is a moving balance of opposing forces that generate change by their tension and struggle, and the principle of Marxian dialectics states that the seeds of any new social order are present in the existing one. this goes right along with the fact that many adolescents who attempt suicide are products of suicidal families, and being from suicidal families increases the chances of becoming suicidal. Marx also said that people not programed robots that will act in certain ways. They will act and react to their self-interest, ideas, knowledge they have, and the pressures with their situation. This point goes back to why many adolescents see suicide as their only or better way out of their situation. <*> <R>.

` <ICLE-US-MICH-0002.1>

Although these theoretical perspectives differ and relate adolescent suicide differently, they do share a common ground in relation to adolescent suicide, and that common ground is depression. There are no theories, theorists, researchers, or even case studies which argue that adolescent suicide isn't a direct result of depression. <*> <R>. Everyone experiences some type or form of depression during his or her life. Its the magnitude of the depression that brings one to contemplate suicide. <*> <R>. Depression can be much more dangerous in adolescents than adults because adolescents don't handle depression as well. <*> <R>.
The other disadvantage of having an ideal male image reflects the issue of sensitivity in men. According to William Masters a social scientist, school age boys are generally expected to show mascularity by demonstrating physical competence and bravery, and are criticized for showing fear or emotions afterall, big boys don't . cry. What happens when boys mistakenly show traces of any sensitivity? They are ridiculed and become the primary concern of psychiatrist, as they think a <*>. These research evaluations have negative psychological and sociological effects on boys as they become afraid to show emotions, bottle up all their feelings so is damaging to the soul, and,,Ieadig-.to dysfunctional behaviour.
They cried, they cheered. Their faces expressed joy, triumph, pride and perplexity. The world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV, expecting something new are at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school: "Have you heard?", "I can't believe it!", "After all this time!", "I never thought it would happen." We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book were proud to be a part of it -- It November 9, 1989, the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-
Having ideal female images can be advantageous too, as have girls learn to take care of their families, thereby creating closely bonded families and well brought up children. But some mothers are not happy with their housewife jobs, and get bored, frustrated and dissatisfied with their lives. The very few women who went to college ended up dropping out to get married for fear of too much education being a bar to marriage <R>. Due to the cultures idea of what women should be, their success is determined by their good marriages. Women feel obliged to stay in bad marriages inspite of the deteriorating situation they face. Betty Friedan a feminist organizer concluded from her psychological research, that women who were defined completely as wives and mothers began to lose all sense of who they were, and had no personalities.
Adolescent suicide is a the major problem in today's society. Theoretically speaking, maybe one to backwards better understand their movements forward.
One of the most persuasive discoveries of the twenthieth centuries has been that of the computer. From personal computers to the internet working of large corporations the computer affects every aspect of , our lives. Today, it having knowledge of how the computer operates is considered a necessary component of leading a succesful life.
Within a few weeks, the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news. But for me, this had been the start. It was the start of what our now as-President Bush likes to refer to as "our" winning of the Cold War -- It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years, the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape. Some been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends, his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money. I had asked him once if he hadn't been scared, scared of what he would find once he left -- He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate, her father's words were at me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --


Bolstered by the Germans' success, the people of Hungary, Tchekoslovaquia, Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as well -- Now, three years later, communism as we once knew it no longer exists. Whether the people are happier or not, I cannot say -- However, they will have at least seen the "other side". Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been vain -- Without the "events of Berlin Wall" history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually, I think that things would have turned out as they did -- However, history cannot be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such, it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore, though we may not always remember the others significant events, we will always remember the day the wall fell --
The negative psychological effects on women results from women's misconception that they are abnomal if they do not derive satisfaction from their routine household jobs, which makes them conclude that they are less of a woman. If women are allowed to setting goals of higher education, and pursue careers without being judge as bad wife or unfit mothers, they would be happier and more independent. Due to the woman*s role as,mother, in some culturing she is made to feel incomplete if she is sterile, and may even be rejected by her husband and in-laws. The traditionalist female image also has damaging effects according to Friedan in her shocking tale of a woman dying of cancer who refused a life saving drug because the side effects so were unfemine <R>. Psychologist have also conceded that womans' role in the house negatively affects women, as their study of housewives showed that these women suffered feelings of desperation, and they termed this condition "the housewives syndrome" <R>.

Many times people do not recognize their normal, every activities as causing water pollution. Individual actions may seem minimal: draining used anti-freeze onto the ground, dumping untreated human waste , from a boat, allowing the car to 'leak a little oil', or over-applying fertilizer to the lawn. However, these small actions combined together could overwhelm a waterbody and cause a degradation targets water quality and a loss of water uses such as swimming, fishing and boating. <*> <R>.
I feel that both genders should work to financial stability of the family, because what happens and the father suddenly dies is that the family goes through a stress phase, and the mother is forced to work anyway. Unfortunately she lacks the necessary job skills and finds securing a job extremely difficult.

The banking field is another area computers have come to dominate. Millions of dollars transfer from one bank to another. Because of this hacking has become quite a problem.  People also need to be more aware of their accounting statements and check carefully each month to see no errors have been made.
There has been a literal explosion of like inventions during the twentieth century ranging from the garbage disposal to the A-bomb. Some were created to make one lives easier, others to the make our lives longer, all were created for the purpose of advancing a civilization. While each one of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another, some stand out as more significantly changing our mode of living. Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition, however; that is the television.

In conclusion, the American I culture should allow both men and women to be who they want-, are or choose to be , and used have to aspire to fit into the traditionalist defination of who they shoud be. If a man is sensitive, he not be ridiculed, and if a woman wants to pursue a career, she should be allowed to do so. Afterall for such a country that fights for freedom of liberty, speech etc, it should also give the individual the freedom of self-actualization.

Human life is dependent on the presence of fresh water. Humans only get less than 3% of the planet's fresh water supply. Most of this-water is tied up in glaciers, ice caps and snow fields, only a fraction is easily accessible for human race. Therefore, we must take responsibility for the water we do have. <*> <R>. Human activities have always led to fresh water pollution, the as as influenced our planet's ecosystem; we must I be able to take responsibility for this behavior.


Before the late 1940's entertainment, news, and information vertually all came through newspapers & radio. A system that seemed to work, many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and or newspaper where they could get the day's information easily and completely. a And, in the case of the radio, all was almost immediate. Description of sporting events, voices acting out stories, persons of the government speaking directly to the people, radio seemed perfect solution to countries with its citizens living at all ends of new boarders.
To look at fresh water pollutants, it is best to divide into four major categories: Infectious agents, organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals and radioactive materials. Infectious agents made up of bacteria, viruses and parasites. The main source these agents are human excrement which are untreated and enter the water cycle. This can have an immediate effect on human health. Organic chemicals include pesticides, fertilizers, plastics, detergents, oil and gasoline. Inorganic chemicals are acids, caustics, salts and metals. Radioactive materials are very rare. They can have natural sources or nuclear waste sources.
<R>

The advent of the television changed all of that, however, giving the public "peak" at what radio wasn't able to give them. Along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world, the television was could to add images- pictures that enhanced the entire absorbtion of what was being broadcast. Where once a reporter's voice described a scene, now the people could see for themselves what was happening because, for the most part, it was happening in front of their eyes.
Finally, person need to continue to keep abreast of new developments , uses for computers as they will continue to a larger parting of our society.
As for sources of pollution, there are two- non-point and point source water pollution. Point source pollution is predictable and easily detected. An example of area source pollution a discharge from a drainpipe. Non-point source pollution does not have a specific location and it unknowingly contaminates water supply. An example of this is leaking oil from an engine and the rain carrying it to a water source. Non-point water pollution is regarded as the most serious war pollution threat in the United States.
	Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewer, the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together.  A president of one country can be seen and heard in a country far away giving his views and ideas so that all can "understand" him.  The small town store owner can watch her son in his olympic race as it's happening without spening thousands to travel to see him in person.  The examples could be endless.

The television strength must be realized, however, as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more. It being a multimillion dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media which has become a significant part the of our lives. It is a power we should be thankful to control as long as we do just that, control it. We can make television work for us in medicine, politics, education, and so much more so it necesary to remember to keep the vision in television.
The Rational Choice Theory is <*> <R>. This relates to water pollution in that society would benefit more if they were informed of the negative effects of water pollution. Some points to consider: The Centers for Disease Control identified 554 human diseases from contaminated water between 1972 and 1990; since 1988, more than 7,700 beaches have been closed due to water pollution and that does not even come close to the amount of possibly dangerous water society consumes; also, a large number of water bodies (one out of ten ocean miles and one of five lake acres) are not safe for swimming. All of these figures and conditions arose from water pollution and companies that contributed to this problem. Rational Choice Theory urges <*> <R>. Companies need to have a fuller sense of the negative and harmful effects of water pollution. The best way to promote awareness is to educate individuals and communities and to insure the cooperation and understanding that everyone will work together to combat this problem. Clean water can be a clear choice. Also, like the text says, companies need to have a greater concerning for water and why it should not be polluted. It is now considered: a violation of the law to to pollute- water. The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 to try to gain control of water pollution. It has been fairly successful in minimizing water pollution since 1972, yet <*> <R>. Thereby, if companies were made aware of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) desires for improvements and tribulations they have faced, conditions might improve. As for much though, the EPA has stated <*> <R>. Are companies aware of the situation of our water supply? If they are, then, in regard to the Rational Choice Theory, do companies want to improve conditions of our water supply? The Rational Choice Theory states that individuals are driven by personal beliefs. Therefore, studies need to be done or presented to these individuals so that they can, in turn, see, know and understand water pollution. Personal beliefs are propounded by these studies and rational choices are consciously made by these beliefs. The Rational Choice Theory is directed by personal beliefs and knowledge of a situation. It can fit into the study of water pollution in that it is individualized and consequential of our actions. Water pollution is a situation that, in this theory's case, needs to be highly publicized and personalized.


I feel the invention of the computer significantly changed people's lives. This, realistically, has been quite a new invention, and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly. Not to mention it will change people's life styles in the future. These changes resulting from the invention of the computer, have been, I feel both bad and good.
As humans we belong to the Phylum Choradata never veering off our structure until we are in the Genus of Homo sapiens. Then we use subclass or ethnicities (black, white; rich, poor; male or female) by act of coercion. This coercion whether it began as a struggle for dominance between two or more ethnicity or not, has invoked stereotypes of each, causing an individual to expect a traditional cause and effect as well as a pre-sought expectation for themselves. Between the struggle of man and woman our history has broadcasted the man as the dominant figure in a world built for both. In Betty Friedan's "The Problem That Has No Name" and "Ralph's Story" by Warren Farrel, the topic is not superiority, but the choices if the individuals are expected to make.

In Ralph´s Story" and "The Problem That Has No Name" both the males and female components realize after-the-fact that they were presented with unforseen consequences to what seemed logical choices in their lives. These stories will correlate a generic comparison for person that reflected on my life.
The Exchange Theory deals with patterns of reinforcement and the situation very rewards and costs. The Exchange Theory has little interest in consciousness. It focuses on the precept that people do things that they are rewarded by. Therefore, water pollution can be directed in this case by showing the costs and rewards people receive from water pollution. Also, water pollution needs to be displayed as degrading to the environment and human health. People who have a negative interaction with an object, such as water, will then resign themselves from interacting with it. If the water does not taste good, people will realize it, form their own opinion and stop drinking it. This is highly personalized and fits into the Exchange Theory. Therefore, in the case of water pollution, to help combat it, there needs to be more interaction like with the problems of pollution, such as the taste or the negative impact on one's health. Also, the Exchange Theory is based on a system of reinforcement. If one has grown up washing their car engine near a drain or water source, then they obviously do not realize the consequences of these actions. People need to be "awakened" in a sense and shown the negative effects many of our trivial actions have on the environment. The Exchange Theory is similar to the Rational Choice Theory in that, it too, is a very personal one and situations are highly individualized. Another concept of reinforcement is that of being seen as a reward, if an actor is deprived of this reward then she will no longer participate in this action. Therefore, if the actor is deprived of quality water then she will recognize the course that has resulted due to human actions. This is significant because water is something that we need in order to survive and without water one cannot function. Therefore, ones' behavior can be modified to better the situation of water pollution. The Exchange Theory also states that <*> <R>. In this case society needs to step in and provide rules such as the Clean Water Act to help improve the situation of water pollution. An important note to remember is that between 1971 and 1990, more than 14,000 people nationwide have become ill from contaminated drinking water. In this instance, water pollution is individualized in its' effects on humans and their health. In terms of costs and rewards, companies may pollute unknowingly and their actions may be detrimental, therefore, companies should take notice of where their excess goes. As for rewards, companies could get low cost disposals, profits, less time spent on disposal, easy access to water sources for dumping and conservation of space due to this dumping. Society could make non-polluting beneficial by showing the negative effects pollution has on society and individuals. Such things as swimming, boating, drinking water all have a personal effect on society. Thereby, due to people's continued actions, pollution is not beneficial for humankind or animal life. Also, in terms of financial means, it costs more to the planet to pollute than it does to save someone time or money spent on removing waste. Contemporary Journal reports that <*>. Water pollution only harms and takes away from nature's resources.
Technologically, computers have improved people's lives drastically. No longer are the times when people must write a papered manually, or even with a simple typewriter. Personal computer are becoming quite common, and therefore less expensive and easier to own. Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before. Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank to wait until it was open. We now have ATM, automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do. It seems these days EVERYTHING has run by computers! We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently. Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results.

While computers have brought about improvements, in my opinion, they also have "impersonalized" the world. Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not "fast enough". Interraction with humans in some places is extinct. Yes, it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank, but I miss human interraction between people. In addition, it is also very dangerous to place all of one's trust in a machine. It is a common fact machines do fail! Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires. Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions, and therefore are incapable, in some instances to function. With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future. Some of these changes will save people's lives, such as advances in medical technology, safety, etc. But I fear that the our world will become a very impersonal place. I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain "slow".
In "Ralph's Story", Ralph they goes through a self awareness process where he realizes that even though he had choices in his life, he had no choice. with Ralph's preconceived idea of what would benefit his family (when acquired) monetarily, he had no choice but I drop baseball for college. When Ralph had the choice of being a social work lawyer or a corporate business lawyer, he had no real choice, he had to become a business lawyer to prove
Water pollution is a serious problem that society faces today. It is not only an environmental problem, but a social one as well. <*> <R>. If people are driven by their beliefs (such as the Rational Choice Theory) and if people interact to those things they experience (such as the Exchange Theory), then sociologists can make a connection with these theories and water pollution. The reason had behind this is that water pollution can be an individualizing as well as a societal phenomena in its' effect on society. In Milwaukee, dozens of AIDS patients died prematurely due to an outbreak of a microorganism that went undetected in the water treatment plant and resulted at thousands becoming ill and many dying. Therefore, water pollution is a societal problem that we all must take responsibility for!

There has up been many inventions in the 20th century that have changed our everyday lives. Some have had a great impact, while others have not. The computer however in this, the informations age, has had a great impact on how society and especially business gathers, creates, responds to and, understand everyday information.

<ICLE-US-MICH-0004.1>

<ICLE-US-PRB-0036.2>
The computer has been around the end of the Second World War. It was mainly used though, by corporations and government to process the huge amounts of information that they needed to gather. At that time the ordinary everyday person had no needing for process information as we do today. As the world got more complex and people started to process and receive information that was much more sophisticated, they needed a tool in order to help them with it. No longer was a secretary and a typewriter enough to handle the ever increasing needs that technology and business done upon society.
During the 20th century there have been several world wide discoveries that have significantly influenced peoples lives. I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual. Every individual holds a different perspectives of life and what they consider to be valuable and important. I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice & discrimination as my topic, because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace.
In "The Problem That Has No Name", the women interviewed had chosen to have an several children and stay at home to cook and clean, not because that was their ideal choice of but because that was the normal characteristic for women and they chooses to be standard norm with deviation. Through a massing guilt, of subconscious resentment for what they call life, blaming themselves as individuals for their suppression <R>.
Cultural and racial equality is a new term that as a society we are striving for. People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today's society. As individuals we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminitive media language and advertising. In the past this type of discrimination, which includes more then blacks African Americans, but also other ethnicities and women, has been excepted as a way of life. Few individuals have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes, and inequality, and demand freedom have and equality. Numerous hidden talents, strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society. However, today we are beginning to move in a new direction. People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be unlearned. Together as a society, and as a much larger world we are recognizing the value in learning from difference. Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed but rather they are being celebrated. Organizations and forms are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism.
The consequences for their decisions were nested deep within the individual. In my experiences, I have grown upped in an age where a career man and a career woman have become necessities in a household. However, members of my family and other generations are new to this. My father has strong comparative characteristics to "Ralph's Story", and my mother and aunt have characteristics of the women interviewed in "The Problem That Has No Name."
In 1980 IBM Corporation started a revolution that today continues full force to dominate our everyday lives; the invention of the personal computer. What the PC (personal computer) meant for society was an affordable tool that would help one sort out, save, delete or add and receiving information in one's own home. This made it possible to write papers, look over databases, do your taxes and expense accounts, just about anything that you had to do. It was a way to organize work and the information that you had to process in an easier fashion and much more quickly. Since 1980 there have been many advances in the technology that was first made available because of this machine. They got faster, more sophisticated, more programs were made available, and they soon became more compatible with others technologies. What this meant was that you now had a faster tool that could do more, receive more, and analyze more information than ever before. Today you can sit in your home at the terminal and create just about any form of document that you wish. You can use it to do just about any task you need it for. Also with the use of Modem you can tap into information sources through the phone on the other computers. You can, with a modem and a computer, recieve and process all types of information that you might need. With the invention of the portable computer you were now able to take that database of information anywhere you wished and put it to use. This meant that with the use of the computer and associated technologies such as a phone and a fax you could do anything from almost anywhere. It is a very powerful tool indeed.
Pot, grass, reefer, kif, Mary Jane, ganga, herb, dope, tea, weed... nicknames for an ancient drug called marijuana When the dried leaves of the cannavis sativa plant are smoked, alone or in combination with tobacco, the result is "high" that ranges from the mildly pleasant to the highly intoxicating. The effect depends on the strength of the drug and this amount smoked. Although there are hundreds of ingredients in marijuana, the main ingredient is a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC affects the brain and circulatory system, especially the heart. It makes the heart beat faster-sometimes dangerously fast-and causes small blood vessels to expand. This is most visible in the eyes, where tiny capillaries swell and fill with blood, giving the eye a bloodshot look.
The opportunity learn about the vast world around us opening up, the avalibility to study cultural difference as and reflect the knowledge on ourselves is improving. Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existance of all humanity. As human beings we need each other and we need to willing to accept those who are different.
What the computer has meant for society is that it has enabled us to . widen our understandings of what goes on in the world by allowing us access to databases information systems more easily, that before were not available.

In 1914 El Paso, Texas, enacted perhaps the first United States ordinance banning the sale or possession of marijuana; by 1931 twenty-nine states had outlawed marijuana. 1937 Congress passed the marijuana Tax Act, effectively criminalizing the possession of marijuana throughout the United States. In 1970 the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act finally differentiated marijuana from other narcotics and reduced federal penalties for possession of small amounts. As directed by Congress, President Richard Nixon appointed a bipartisan commission to study marijuana. In 1972 the Schafer Commission issued its report, advocating the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use- a recommendation that Nixon rejected. However, eleven states, containing a third of the on country's population, decriminalized marijuana in the 1970's, and most states weakened their laws against it. The 1980's however saw a enormous turnaround on the views on marijuana. Ronald Reagan's election brought the war on drugs to the White House. In 1980 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) called marijuana the most urgent drug problem facing United States <R>.

This paper will focus on marijuana being used as medicine, industrial fabrics, and for personal use. It win also focus on the problems that could be avoided with decriminalization of marijuana, such as overcrowded prisons, lenient action taken on violent crimes, such as rape and murder, and the lack of good, intelligent judges. This paper will also focus on the key positive aspect of legalizing marijuana-the enormous amount of revenue it would bring to our government. All of the issues mentioned above will be studied through the structural functional theory, , exchange theory, or the conflict theory.

The turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe. Each decade in itself has introduced a new "fad" or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as "typical" of the era. The "Roaring 20's" for example was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile. A very capricious decade, it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the "Great Depression" of the 30's. How can we ever forget the "Fabulous Fifties" or the hippie decade of the 60's and 70's? For change is inevitable, as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the decade, there is one aspect of the 20th Century that will remain with me forever. So as we embark on the year 2000, I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century, "The Century of Democracy."


Perhaps, it is because today is November 4th, the day after the U.S. elections. Perhaps, it is because the former superpower of the Soviet Union now making its transition into a democracy. Perhaps, it is because I am thousands of miles from my home, but I'm feeling very patriotic these days.
Using marijuana as medicine is not a new idea. In 1993 scientists in Israel exhumed body of a studying woman who died in childbirth 1600 years ago. These scientists found a burned material they identified as marijuana. It was evidently used to ease the pain the a difficult labor <R>.
No, I'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism from a citizen from the United States. Rather, I'm feeling patriotic I then look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations.
However, today marijuana is not widely accepted as legal for medicinal purposes. Pot is currently classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. This implies that pot has a high potential for abuse, no officially accepted medical uses, and no safe level of use under medical supervision. This statement is very alarming becuase pot is one of the few known therapeutically active substances which there is no well-defined fatal dose. It has been estimated that a person would have to smoke a hundred pounds of marijuana a minute for fifteen minutes in order to induce a lethal response <R>. more alarming is the fact that heroine, LSD, and peyote are other Schedule1 drugs. Cocaine and POP are listed in Schedule 2, allowing doctors to prescribe them <R>.
Over the years, too much emphasis has been put on distinct gender identities. It was once thought that men could have only certain identifying characteristics and, likewise, that women could have only certain identifying characteristics. Today, however, best stereotypical behavior is becoming a phenomenon of the past. We, as an ever changing society, should abolish distinct gender identities and recognize the fact that distinct male and female identities can be prevalent in either gender."Distinct gender identity" is not a common phrase and, therefore, requires explanation. Over the years, traditionalists have stereotyped the male gender to be <*>. Likewise, women have also been stereotyped to be <*>. Each set of qualities or characteristics was thought to be possessed only by a specific identified gender. It was also thought to be abnormal if ones gender possessed qualities or characteristics of the opposite gender.

In the past 2 years alone, we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe. Not too long ago, I remember democratic demonstration that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic superpower. At the world Expo in Sevilla, not a month ago, I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall- the Wall that was a symbol to many from the harsh realities of the Cold War. That wall is gone forever and I feel lucky to be among the many who could follow its happening.

In March 18th 1992 the DEA rejected the pleas of medical-marijuana advocates to reclassify the drug so that it could be prescribed by doctors, even though marijuana could do a great deal of good for a great number of people. Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, believes that marijuana will someday be hailed as a "miracle drug," one that is safe, inexpensive, and versatile. Like many doctors, Grinspoon states in his book, Marijuana. The Forbidden Medicine (1993) that smoking marijuana can relieve the nausea associated with chemotherapy, prevent blindness induced by glaucoma, serve as an appetite stimulant to AIDS patients, act as an anti-epileptic, ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches, alleviate chronic pain, and reduce muscle spasticity that accompanies multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia <R>. Even with all of this being stated the DEA will still not legalize marijuana for medical purposes. The sick people that could be helped with doctor prescribed pot be the first priority foe the DEA. However politics is often involved. In 1991 a Public Health Service (PHS) spokesman admitted that for the government to say pot could be therapeutic would be an unwise signal to send during a "mar on drugs." Recently James Mason, head of the PHS offered this excuse for not allowing pot for medicinal purposes- he feared the AIDS patients, crazed on pot would be more likely to practice unsafe sex.
Tradition has played an important role concerning distinct gender identities. Today, however, some women are thought for possess male gender qualities and some men are thought to possess female gender qualities. The fact that a man possesses feminine gender qualities does not mean that he is less masculine. Likewise, the fact that a woman possesses male gender qualities does not mean that she is less feminine. William H. Masters, getting Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, note researchers, have found that today masculine and feminine traits being looked at separately and that they <*>. Stated differently, a woman who is aggressive and competitive can be quite feminine. Also, a man who is sensitive and loving may also be very masculine.
Despite all of the negative attention medical-marijuana has received, there are still those who endorse its use. A recent study by two Harvard drug-policy researchers found that almost half of 1,035 oncologists surveyed said they would prescribe pot if it were legal. Also, 44% of them said they had advised patients to smoke pot despite the possibility of prosecution. PHS has some arguments against marijuana use by AIDS patients-mainly that it contains carcinogens and it may harm the immune system of AIDS patients. This argument seems to be irrelevant because pot has been proven to be a carcinogen and :pot's main ingredient, THC, is already sold in pill form as Marinol. According to the Harvard study, 77% of those oncologists who had an opinion on the matter say smoking marijuana is more effective than oral THC. Because puffs are easier for patients to measure than pills, it is also less likely to get them uncomfortably high. Furthermore, AZT, the most effective AIDS treatment, causes cancer in animals, and it is legal to give patients. Lastly AIDS patients are willing to risk anything to recover <R>.
The Soviet used Union, as well is going through its own transition to democracy. The many in unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their nation of its communist government. The superpower among superpowers that to me had long the example of marxism is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world.
The developing and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world. I do not speak of a certain object in particular, but of technology as who a whole. This thing, technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and the greatest Nemesis of the world.
Traditionally, women were taught that their greatest goals in life were to be a wife and then a mother. Betty Friedan, a feminist organizer and writer, states that <*>. Many women became unhappy with their lives as a wife and mother and wondered if this was all that life had to offer. These women had always been taught that their distinct gender identity only included traits commonly found in wife and mother; however, they were not fulfilled. These women were led to believe that if they were not happy fulfilling this role that something must be wrong with them <R>. As a result, they were psychologically affected by their unhappiness and also by their feelings of a lack of to self-fulfillment. In this instance, by very abolishing the distinct gender identity, there would be no psychological impact and, therefore, a more well-adjusted female would exist.
So far thirty-five states have endorsed medical-marijuana. . In San Francisco:-police agreed with to turn a blind eye to it. Unless the government does something similar, smoking marijuana to relieve intolerable discomfort will remain, incredibly, a crime <R>.
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this one of the world, they have provided a living for my family, they have cured my grandmother of cancer, they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine, science, engineering, and even the less overt corners of our lives. The use of the means humans have developed wherein the greatest problems lie. Alone, they do not threaten us, but when they become welded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies, they become potentially the most dangerous things we hold in our hands.
Using pot as medicine indeed seems very functional for our society. By legalizing it as medicinal, doctors will be able- to supervise its use for the patients. By keeping it illegal, not only will sick patients be prosecuted and most likely thrown in jail, creating even more-social problems, such as overcrowded prisons, but they will also use it unwisely without doctors supervision. In additions to this the Exchange Theory applies. There are rewards to using pot as a medicine. could at the very least relieve some very sick people of some pain. At the very most it could be an aid to curing diseases. The one main cost would be that patients could abuse pot as a form of treatment; but as was already stated this could be monitored by a doctor.
With the end For the Cold War, has been more peaceful relations throughtout the world. The idea of a nuclear war is practically non-existent today. Arms sales have gone closed so that nations may spend this money in more worthwhile areas.
	Overcrowded prisons is another concern of pro-legalization advocates. Since the latest war on drugs began in the 1980 s, the nation's prison population has more than doubled. The majority of these prisoners are first time offenders who have no history of violence. Some people would argue that this is for purposes of crime control. This function is not being accomplished however. There has been no decrease in the use of marijuana. In fact marijuana is making a huge comeback, especially for high school and college students. The costs are great when it comes to imprisoning people for the possession or use of marijuana. Rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals are often released from prison to make room for people who have been incarcerated because of marijuana. The rewards of keeping dangerous people in prison and off of the streets far outweigh the so-called crime-control policies of the opposition of legalizing marijuana. Therefore according to the-Exchange Theory rewards should overpower the costs, therefore sending signals to people in power that this way of justice is not only not working, but is also dangerous. Marx's conflict theory can also be applied to this area of justice. The most likely people to become incarcerated for anything related to pot are the lower class. The middle and upper classes use pot just as frequently, if not more than the lower class. However, money and prestige have power; power enough to keep some people out of prison. Using Marx's  conflict theory, the lower class will become frustrated and enraged by this blatant lack of justice and a class conflict will arise.
Men, traditionally, were looked upon to be the aggressor of , the two genders. Moreover, they were considered very successful if they exuded male gender traits to an extreme degree. This, in and of itself, placed a tremendous psychological burden on the male gender to succeed. Warren Farrell, a noted psychologist, recounts a story in which the main character pays a high price for adhering to gender-based codes success <R> In this narrative, Ralph, the main character, states <*>. Unfortunately, the male gender identity requires that a man be competitive and aggressive. if these traits were abolished or became non-distinct, multi-gender characteristics, men would be relieved of this pressure and, therefore, the psychological burden would be lifted. This would, in turn, provide a more healthy male gender.
In conclusion, as the turn of the century slowly approaches, I back with a feeling of accomplishment as well liking anticipation as to what lies ahead. As a world of many scattered nations, conflict is inevitable. However, if we all have one bond- democracy- then maybe together, we can learn to understand one another, and work towards a happier world my for all.
Marijuana stalks contain fibers that can be woven to make rope, canvas and paper <R>. This is a very important function of the United States economy. There has been so much attention in the past few years about goods made in the United States. About 25% of the pot available in the United States is grown here. By growing pot in the United States and using it for industrial fabrics the United States not only makes money but it saves it because less imports are needed of such items and because pot is so inexpensive to grow and cultivate. There would be less conflict between the unemployed and the employed. Jobs would be made available by the different industry of marijuana. The unemployment rate would go down and people would be more pleased to buy American products. Once again the rewards are many.
Speaking from my experience living the United States, I have come to feel my technology has become a large detriment for the youth in particular. People say that technological development has made our world much smaller,



With the divorce rate escalating, there are more and more single parent families. There are women who are having to play the role of mother and father. At the same time, there are also men who are having to play the role of mother and father. Women, who are faced with the task of being a single parent, are forced to be strong, courageous, dependent, and self-reliant. Even though these are strictly male gender identity characteristics, these women are forced to emanate these qualities. Likewise, men, who are faced the the task of being a single parent, are forced to be sensitive and loving. Even though these are distinct female gender identity characteristics, a single father would be forced to radiate these qualities in order to raise a I healthy, well-adjusted child. it would be ridiculous to think that men should not provide these qualities in order to raise their children just because the male gender identity does not permit them to be sensitive and loving. Likewise, it would also be ridiculous to think that women should not be strong, courageous, dependant, , self-reliant just because the female gender identity does not include these traits.
and I would , concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets. In that schools, Geography classes rarely, if ever, exist. Before I came to Spain, a group children asked me if Spain was in Michigan.
Another problem brought about Because of the criminalization of marijuana is the increasing number of judges retiring. The anti-drug mandatory-minimum sentences have created dissension in the federal legal system. A lack of respect for the profession (judge), a sentencing process that often reduces judges to the status of adding machines, a staggering backlog of drug cases, and a widespread sentiment that judges are not to be trusted in choosing sentences (it is now up to the District Attorney in drug cases), may all combine to persuade highly qualified people to avoid the bench <R>. Marx's conflict theory could apply here because there is sure to to be tension between judges and the system. Already some of the tension has appeared causing many capable judges to retire. Justice is one of the most important components of our society. With the level of justice falling due to the retirement of good judges, the entire structure is changing. This could become a trend-weak judges on the bench not offering any real justice. Once the function justice is deadened, so too will be the structure of society as we know it. The rewards of good judges and equal justice outweigh the rewards of speedy, unfair trials and full prisons.
<ICLE-US-MICH-0029.1>

In today's society, distinct gender identities have proven themselves to be useless and also harmful. The psychological effects, due to stereotypical behavior, have been determined to be destructive. Moreover, women in the work place and single-parent women have been compelled to be aggressive and competitive on order to succeed. Also, single fathers having found it necessary to are loving and sensitive in order to be a good parent. Distinct gender identities have become obsolete today's society and should, therefore, be eliminated.
Explaining that Spain was locates across the ocean did not seem for improve their understanding of layout of our world.

Marijuana is also associated with a very ugly part of our society-crime. Pot represents a significant part from the international drug trade, a network of organized crime, and lately, terrorists, who use the proceeds to finance terrorist activities throughout the world <*>. There are also many thefts and breakins because are trying to obtain pot. Obviously prison time does not serve as a deterrent. The entire harmony and structure of society is being threatened because crime is so rampant. People are going to obtain pot any way they can. The law should focus its attention on violent criminals not on people whose soles crime is getting high. Would it not make sense to reduce crime by simply legalizing marijuana?

	The final aspect in legalizing marijuana is the amount of revenue it will bring to the United States. The value of America's annual marijuana crop is staggering. Plausible estimates start at four billion dollars and range up to twenty-four billion dollars.  In 1993, the value of the nation's largest cash crop, corn, was roughly sixteen billion dollars <R>. The United states government is so far in debt now the legalization of pot could only help the economy. The government spent around thirty billion dollars at state, federal, and local levels to fight marijuana. With all of the money spent on fighting pot we could pay off some of the debt or use it on something else like education. The rewards of billions of dollars coming in is far greater than the cost of billions of dollars leaving the government's pockets. Part of the function of our society is to make money. The sale of marijuana could greatly benefit that function. By legalizing pot the black market would also very soon disappear. Not only would pot be cheaper if it were legal; it would be monitored by the government, but the marijuana would also be pure and safe. By growing it here, the government could make sure that no other drugs were mixed in with the pot.

Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that cannot be described, and I feel that its people to have adopted the same "I am a self-sufficient- I don't need any help" type of mentality that will slowly destroy us. Our awareness of other people, other cultures, and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators. Until I was 15, I was unable to study any foreign language at all, and even at that timed I had only one choice of languages- German. Since I was twelve, I had an intense desire to learn Spanish, and because of these circumstances, that I mentioned before, I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language. Mine not the only experience like this. The effort of the United States has caused our minds to be heard, and being a world that is growing while my country lags behind in its selfish self-satisfaction.


The legalization of marijuana for purposes of medicine, recreation, and industrial fabrics, has many positives aspects. A Few negative aspects are brought up by the opposition. However, by using the Exchange Theory, Conflict Theory, and Structural Functional Theory to analyze the social also problem of criminalization of marijuana it is clearly shown that the rewards of legalization outweigh the effects of keeping pot ideal. In addition to this is one main reason why pot should be legalized-Not a during single death has forever been credibly attributed directly to smoking or consuming marijuana in the 5,000 years of the plant's recorded use <R>. This is simply amazing considering the fact that alcohol and over-the-counter medications are legal and have causes many more than one death.

a constantly changing world, it is important for both genders to have a firm grasp on just what it means to be a man or a woman. This establishment of gender identity should begin at the earliest age possible. Masters and Johnson say children begin to recognize gender roles by age three. (548) Children should be taught that there is a core of behavior that makes them boys or girls but, there are other types of behavior that is open to change. The message children are given now is a stereotype that has been the root of many problems they encounter later in life. Men and women today some need to understand and respect the fact that they are different. They communicate in different styles. This difference is what makes life exciting. Gender roles, like relationships, must remain dynamic. People `` know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.

In 1945, Now J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the wold his invention in the form that is still most familiars to us today: The Atomic bomb.

To achieve a well adjusted, gender relazed, adulthood society must ammend the method and the message we are giving our children. Katha Pollit does an excellent job of illustrating how television, one a of the more influential sources for children, is giving kids a skewed start in shaping their ideas of what's important in being a boy or a girl. In her essay "The Smurfette Principle", she cites. many painful examples of how little ones very receive a terribly distorted picture of gender roles. Although the method takes on many forms, the message is the same <*>.
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy. Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill. Never before let one object of such small size been able to take so many lives. For this reason, It is considered the most awe-inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world.
How people live without the invention from the computer? Computers have become a part of everyday life for many people. Computers can found everywhere from schools for huge businesses. People often rely greatly on computers. Computers have significantly changed people's lives.
Pollit pints out that even the more boy enlightened Public Broadca stations engage in male gender bias.

A basic right of a human being living in a democratic society is that they are entitled to life. Food and shelter are fundamental needs a person must have in order to survive. A percentage of the population of the citizens of America lack these necessities. Homelessness has become an intense problem in the United States that must be solved. by There is an agreement between all opposing viewpoints in government that something must be done that to combat homelessness. The necessary method to be used to understand homelessness is under careful scrutiny. Advocates for people without homes tend to get so wrapped up in the size of the homeless population that they ignore the fact that it is not right that this discrepancy exists. What is true is that in the United States over it is continually growing, action must be taken immediately to alleviate the problem.
For many people computers have get a of their everyday life.
Starting girls into life's roller coaster ride with the idea that boys lives are more important than their's is a tremendous disadvantage. It's a bad message delivered at a bad time through a bad medium. Even the best parents allowed their children to watch Saturday morning for cartoons where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur. Parents allow their kidding to watch these cartoons for two reasons; first, because they watched them when they were kids and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet. It is important to note that these bad signals have an adverse effect on boys as well as girls. Pollit contends:that the message is more straight forward for the boys.

IN people's home calculators as usually found and often even personal computers can be found in a private home. At the office, in school, or while shopping one will find many computers being used. People use computers in many different settings because they are so useful and speed-up many laboreous tasks.
Although we have many other power source alternatives, we still continue to use this dangerous invention. It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use, we can escape harm. Already 'm as a result of pollution and other various factors, we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in much parts of the world. It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage the earth and its inhabitants.
Computers are relied on greatly for help with things such as filing, finding information, and solving equations. Computers speed-up tasks that used to take up a lot of time. Schools use computers to teach children because it is fun and exciting. Businesses use computers because they can be more productive by doing things quickly and getting more work done. Computers make things more efficient and often do anything faster than humans. People come to rely on computers because of these reasons.
Now that our children are off to a wonderful start they are ready for adulthood. The effects of this twisted gender identity beginning are made evident in two startling stories of problems people encounter when they realize they have spent their lives doing something they don't like. "Ralph's Story" by Warren Ferrell is a scarry confession of a successful lawyer who has neglected his family and himself. He hates the person he has become. Ralph's case is one of mistaken identity. His idea of what a man is supposed to be is wrong. Wrong because Ralph lives his life the way society tells him to, instead of doing the things that make him happy or a better sponse. Betty Frieden's excerpt on what women were going through in the 1960's is similar to Ferrell's essay. Friedon writes how women homemakers live a life that others expect of them. These twisted exogenic pressures deny women of any real choice in life. Both of these stories are examples of how women and men fall into stereotypical gender roles without any curiosity. They do not ask themselves if a different lifestyle would make them happy. They fail to confront that great fear of the unknown. It is difficult to face your family and friends with a confession of your life of unhappiness. On the other hand, its easy to done the things people expects of your gender. Society's semiotics on how each gender is supposed to behave are everywhere. One cannot go to work, watch T.V., listen to the radio, or even drive in your car without being exposed to clear and definitive signs of massed produced gender identity.
People living without shelter has been a problem in America since settlers from Europe came. Coming to America meant freedom and opportunity to the early settlers. They arrived in masses to the coast penniless and with no shelter. Throughout history this trend has continued. During the 19th century, industry in this country rose to new heights. Numerous factories developed, in these factories to workers had a great insecurity about their job permanence. Unemployment became a live threat to most working Americans. Impoverished people were interpreted negatively as seen in the book Homelessness: A Sourcebook Rick Fantasia and Maurice Isserman which states that <*>. Cheap labor was a direct result of trying to distinguish between the homeless that deserved help and the ones that done not. The cheap labor was used in industry and it provided the authorities with an excuse to limit the funds that had been designated for the poor.
The saddest to part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so. The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling. With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today, what to become of our children.
Fredian, Ferrell and Pollitt do an excellent job of exposing the problems of stereotypical gender roles. Their approach is that gender rolds are needed, they just need to be ammended to fit in a changing society. Dr. John Grey, a Califorian marriage counselor, is trying to ammend these roles. His book "Men are From Mars, Women are From Venue" goes a long way in kind helping both sexes understand that it is not only o.k. to be different, but it's exciting. Grey's planet metophor enriches his piont of men's and women's different style of communication. to He also promotes the concept of gender roles being open to change. The people cited in Friedan's and Ferrell's essay were static. Grey calls this man going into their caves and women wanting to talk. (29) Here Grey's metophor explains and validates how different genders react under pressure. He explains that if both parties learn to accept the others methods their own lives will become better.
During the middle of the 19th century there was an increased desire to help the homeless. In this movement poorhouses were established. Changes with the cheap labor, poorhouses were only available to the people that were the most "deserving" of the poor. This attempt did not help prevented homelessness. The establishement of poorhouses only separated the general public from the people without homes to a greater extent. Tramps were part of the homeless community living in the poorhouses. There was also an increase in migratory workers during this time. People was forced to go where the jobs were and leave their families behind. In the 1870s the economy became much more stable than it had been before. Permanent work becomes an option for a greater amount of people during this time.
People's lives have changed significantly since the invention of and calculator (the first computer). Many tasks have been made easier and are done more efficiently. Many people find knowledge of computer skills very helpful when looking for job. People have come to depend on the function of a computer to help everyday life run smoothly.
The current situation of the world's environment is a sad one. It is also however, a problem of which nuclear energy is only a little piece. Unfortunately, the day will soon go come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable. This is why it is imperative to act today. take It starts with you. Write your local congressman.
All the experts cited in this essay understand the importance of separate gender identity. This is evident by the fact that each writer even bothered to bring these problems to light. Each writer is saying that both sexes should go free to establish their own role in society, without cumbersome and misguided pressures from a political correct world. The best way to achieve this goal is to begin changing the message we give our children. Children need to know men and women walk, talk, drive, and grow in different ways. They also need to learn that in and women are not limited by their sex. Either type must be allowed to dream of achieving any goal that they can create in their respective minds. The successful role model that children can draw strength from is not going to be just Dad anymore, but mom as well.
In the early period of the 20th century everything changed. The economy shrank and the Great Depression began. made the problem of homelessness more numerous than ever. Millions of people lost their homes and their lobs. Consequently, unemployment and homelessness were dramatically increased. People were forced to move to other areas of the United States. Many people were hungry and dying. They were desperate to found some form of relief. President Roosevelt passed some social legislation as a direct reaction to the Great Depression. This form of legislation was new, and it brought about the recognition of the actual nature of poverty in an industrial nation. It made people aware the social and economic basis of poverty.


Computers are indeed one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. People have made computers part of everyday life. Computers does many useful and have wonderful things, but people have often experienced the drawbacks of such a wonderful invention. at When computers break down people are thrown back to the old way of life before computers. This is when it becomes evident that people are very dependent on computers when computers do break down. Many people will ask, "How did people live without the invention of the computer?

Later in the 20th century, people began to have a negative perception of homeless people again. During the 1950s, the stereotypical alcoholic person without a home became what people saw. Homelessness became a larger problem during the 1960s and 1970s when the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill occurred. This was the movement to empty the mental institutions. As a consequence the number of homeless that are mentally ill are still high today. The homeless were still looked down upon now during this time. But, the 1980s showed a little more compassion towards the homeless. A major concern of he the nation was once again homelessness. the early 1990s the general public had begun blaming and demeaning the homeless. Many people even became violent towards the homeless. People have now become separated on how to actually solve the problem of homelessness.



The ability to pinpoint the exact number of homeless people is practically impossible. There are the homeless that sleep to the streets and under bridges, and many find refuge in abandoned buildings. People without shelter also stay with friends or family. There is no possible way to count all of these people. Arguments about the homeless tend to become obsessed with the actual figures concerning homelessness instead of simply saying there is a problem that must be fixed. An abundant amount of families are on the brink about being without a home. Some are only one paycheck away from being homeless.
One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century has to do with the speed at which information is now communicated throughout the globe. In fact, all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives. If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention of the field, it would have to be the television. Through the television, 's and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening. This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live, and in a way it has, and continues to shrink the , planet we live on. There are, however, several downsides to the television, and, like all inventions can be used in a useless way.
. Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at for work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.
Personally, I find that relativity hasn't its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a "moment" would reveal the knowledge from "within" was in effect shattered. The philosopher's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust.
The cause of homelessness involves a combination of factors which makes the problem extremely complex to solve. During the 1960s and 1970s there was a movement to empty the mental institutions and by doing this those mental patients were forced into the streets. Also, another component of the cause of homelessness is the dramatic increase in the cost of housing. This increase has essentially priced the poor out of the housing market. The housing for low income families has dropped as well. Real estate agencies have also conspired against the poor in order the "clean our cities." They have virtually taken the land in the cities away from the poor. Funding from the federal government for housing for the poor has declined. Technology have also played a part in replacing the jobs the poor with computer run factories. Low skill jobs are difficult to find and most poor are not qualified for anything else.
Many men and women make the mistake of letting their lives be ruled by the advice of others, causing themselves much soul-searching and agonising uncertainty over wich direction their lives should take. They are particularly vulnerable as young people being ,pressured in making decisions as to what they want to do the rest of their lives. Sometimes they already have a good idea of what they would like to make of their lives, but it may be impractical, or at least others tell them that it is. All too often, they choose a course because it is rational and erected of them. But the what if it's wrong?
Not even truly dealing with the amount of television that watched by the average person, there are several other important ways that television had changed people's lives. One interesting development has been the use of television in wars. The vietnam war the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what I was like to be at war. This was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting. We are able also to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe, and this has led to public concern and effort, for instance, in Somalia. Of course radio was already able to transmit the sound, but the coming of the picture has had even more significance.
Since it is my socialization that leads me for have a notion of earthtime [24 hours = day] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it. Although I don't claim to understand relativity, I've attempted to indwell the topic [like sidphantha and his rock]. The point is my notion of time has changed; And I think once humanity realizes that time-notions are human constructions and are subject to change, that then the impact of Einstien's idea will be felt. For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien's "invention" for intentions not worthy of the genius; namely: atomic bombs.
My generation ago women were advised by Betty Friedan in her very popular book, "The Feminine Mystique", that they were effectively wasting their lives if they didn't do more than stay home, clean house, raise the children, and keep the man of the house in clean shirts. <*> wrote Friedan. Yet, "The Problem That Has No Name," (an excerpt from "The Feminine Mystique") described women who fretted about their lives and wished for something more, but they were not sure what. Feminists, following Friedan's logic, extolled the glamour, self-enhancement, and personal satisfaction of pursuing a career. Many women followed this advice and at the same time did their best to have a successful marriage and be a perfect mother. In the process, society witnessed the evolution of the career woman who worked from 9 to 5 each day, then raced home after picking up the kids from nursery school or a babysitter, prepared supper, listened to homework of older children, put them to bed, and then tackled some housework. Of course, most men helped around the house. But many women ended up dissatisfied with their career, their marriage, and a good part of their whole life. Many felt that they didn't do a good job with any part of their life, because each part demanded more than they could give. Some women, with insight enough to realize they couldn't do it all at once, put off having children until their careers were established, only to discover that their "biological clocks" had run of time before they were ready to interrupt their careers for a family.
In the homeless community there are a disproportionate amount of minority groups. There is a concentration of African-Americans in the urban areas which are hit the hardest by the unequal educational opportunities in the cities. Because of this discrepancy in education, an uneven number of African-Americans are forced to take the jobs available to too them because of their lack of education. Therefore, there are an unequal amount of African-Americans and other minorities out on the streets or without a on home because of such discrimination.
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions of the planet. Gone are the days unknown and unheard of areas. Television is able to bring any part of the world into your very living room within a matter of seconds. is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way , in which to communicate with populations. There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing, and this is true. It is also used in ways that can desensitize one's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real. Either way, however, that it is used, there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century.

Homelessness is an obvious problem which is in desperate need of a remedy. Throughout history sociologists have examined social problems with the hope of trying to find a rational solution to the issues. they have does this by applying certain sociological theories to the social problems. There are many theories that may be used, and it is the sociologists choice on what the most the appropriate route to use in analyzing the problem would be. One such theory is the conflict theory. Competition is at the hearts of this theory. Everyone is fighting for what resources they see to be rightfully theirs.
This is not to say that women are the only ones caught for the career trap. There is a lot of correlation between the woman who is dissatisfied with her life as wife/mother/homemaker/care person and the man dissatisfied with his life as breadwinner/successful worker/husband/father. Ralph, as described in "Ralph's Story" by Warren Farrell, and others like him, are likely to find that it good spend their whole trying to get ahead in a job and make a good living for the family, while in the process losing the respect and affection of the very ones they're working for. And along the way, the life the man would have preferred to live has faded into impossibility along with the addition of wrinkles and gray hair. Ralph confessed <*>.
The significance of atomic bombs cannot be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century. It set-up a a network a global systems. USA-USSR; with Japan and Germany as in the "winners". Cold wars; north-south relations. Many things have been generated: namely fear! Relatively speaking, fear has been the main point in departure for the global community construction. This is a point that I think needs to be changed, from fear to peace. A shift in focus if you will. Some would say this is too utopic;
With <ICLE-US-MICH-0032.1>
But humanity sought to understanding relativity (as Stephen Hawkings) our notions would be radically changed. For now, must deal with the short comings of humanity's use of Einstien's ideas: atomic weapons.

"Ralph's Story" was written in least decade and is more contemporary than Betty Friedan's work, but the similarity is unmistakable. Men and women, then as now, are trapped by the expectations from others. A woman today, if she pursues a career as expected by her peers, still I obliged to make a home, oversee the care of the children, and be a nurturing wife and mother.

An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people's lives is the invention of the airplane. The extend to where this invention has altered people's lives is astronomical. The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people's perceptions of the entire world. It also introduced what seemed completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine: the concept flying.

The alternative, if a woman chooses not to follow the herd, is to suffer a harder life by eliminating a part of the whole (not be a mother but choose a career vs. full a mother and disregard or postpone a career). Is it a harder life to forgo motherhood? Many young women would say definitely yes, even while enjoying the prosperity and prestige that usually accompany a career. Yet if a woman decides on motherhood alone, the made suffers the loss of her income while gaining her undivided attention as a mother and homemaker. The jury's still out liked to whether that's a real or imagined hardship, but today a woman is almost reouired to work outside the home in order to make ends meet, never mind the extras, whether there are children to consider or not. It has become an accepted way of life for most families.
Before the invention of the airplane, long distance traveling was a very difficult, time consuming task. For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own. One could travel by boated but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease, hunger, and threatening weather; also as noted above, it was extremely time consuming. Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world. I have learned a lot about my own culturing just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited. I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures. Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity for witness it first hand.
In my home town of Kalamazoo, the invention of the shopping mall has changed the lives of the people in our town and town itself. While many people enjoy and utilize the shopping malls, I believe that they are more of a detriment a blessing.
The invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations. Since the invention of the airplane the world 'd increased close contact between political systems, and international business endeavors. The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade. The airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also. Life with airplanes is more rapid paced.
A woman who decides to stay home and raise a family often suffers in a more subtle way: Society, since the time of Friedan's rise to fame, wonders "what else" a wives and mother does with her time. No one would comes right out and say that motherhood is not a valuable occupation, but, the implication is that she should be doing something else with her life, too.

still get drugs. Today, kids like to take risks even though there are enormous consequences when caught. Sometimes, I feel there is a need to eliminate the drinking and cigarettes age law. I do not know of many people under the age of twenty-one and eighteen that can not get a hold of some alcohol beverages and cigarettes and other tobacco products when they want to. my high school the people who were caught smoking underage received the same punishment as the people old enough to smoke. People will start these habits at young , ages, even though it is illegal. It also starts kids to be interested in fake identification cards. The product of having these cards is , illegal, but it does not stop anyone.
Kalamazoo, like most American cities, which began surrounding the central means of transportation. Cities were first located near water, then near train tracks, and then began to locate themselves farther further due to the inventions of trucks and cars. Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful district. Near the train the station were the larger industries, and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies. Homes and neighborhoods were located Outside of the central city; however, many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families to live in.


Ralph decided early on to follow the advice of others supposedly wiser than he, giving up his dream of becoming a baseball player. He later made career choices that increasingly took him away from his family. He told himself he was providing his wife and children with the things wanted, but in reality he ended up depriving them of himself. He denied his own deepest wishes because others (whether individuals or society as a whole) felt he should do it and he allowed himself to be led. Men so for my acquaintance have been required to travel on business, spending days and weeks away from their families, only to discover that the children have grown up without them and are strangers under the same roof. Also, the wife, cherished and hopeful for 'the good life', as a newlywed, now is a stranger and may very well be resentful many all the time apart.
Most violent crimes I stimulate from selling illicit drugs. People are always trying to sell and buy drugs, which leads to people guns for protection.

medical profession of the 20th century has made many exciting discovery advancing its ability to cure many ailing human beings; however, with all of the new technology & discoveries we find ourselves struggling to survive the disease AIDS.
The tragedy of the wrong choice was as likely to happen a generation ago as a decade ago - nothing has changed. What is the worst that would have happened if Ralph had become a baseball player? He may have been weeded out during the first season of play - a blow to his ego, perhaps, but not a tragedy. And at least he would have given it a try while he was still young enough to choose another career if he failed. What if Ralph had taken the path becoming a social-work lawyer as he wanted, instead of becoming a corporate lawyer? His career might not have been as lucrative, and perhaps his family would have had to settle for a more modest house and forgo the country club membership - a hardship, yes. On the other hand, Ralph would have had the personal satisfaction of helping others and possibly would have earned more love and respect from his family in the long run. What's not to like about a man who does good for others and feels good about himself while doing it?
Rich and poor alike had easy friend access to the offerings of the central city. Throughout history, the trend is for the rich to get richer and the poor remain poor. While the rich got richer, they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside of the city limits. And, the more wealthy moved from the inner city (with help from the invention of the automobile) to the suburbs where the could keep a distance from the busy inner city. While the more wealthy began moving away from the inner city, the poor and lower working class remained due to lack of transportation or money to move outwards. This process has left the businesses in the inner cities, including Kalamazoo, without a stable clientel. Why should we, say those with cars, go downtown where the more poorer people are and have to shop outside going from specialized store to store, when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything? Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did, and still do, and relocate in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves. I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or enjoy the downtown district remain and stay in business. Many larger factories and office building still remain downtown. And, the executives and business peopled rely on commuting to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once, a thriving neighborhood.

What if a young woman chooses motherhood for the formative years of her children's lives that then, once the children are in school, begins her career later in life?

Due to the ineffectiveness of medicines; the population has needed to seek other forms of comfort & rehabilitation. During the 20th century hospitals have begun support centers for peopled to deal w/ their disease & help the rest of the population to become more educated in this matter. If AIDS not be prevented by medication, up is possible that it can be prevented by knowledge.

One feature that does attract business is colleges. Kalamazoo has 1 large university, 1 private college and two "community-2 yr." colleges. The large , private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kalamazoo, so many business try to cater to our tastes- clubs, cafés and other stores. Another attempt to reinstate success is downtown festivals. We have many, and they always attract those from the suburbs.
Jails are over crowded as it is. am If marijuana was legalized, then jails would have more room for those who pose a danger to society. The police could worry more about solving more murder cases than a lot these drug cases. Most people convicted of drug crimes are convicted because intent to distribute the drugs to other citizens. If marijuana were sold in the stores, there probably would be a huge profit.
This disintegration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects: the poor and lower middle class. There neighborhoods don't get financial support and money is not spent in the stores near them. If they could have more money and leave, the majority would. Shopping malls, strip malls, and the flu from the inner cities by upperclass Americans will only hurt those who can't escape in the end - in fact, it already is hurting businesses lives in the downtown districts.
Hopefully, the number of drug users would decrease. At the rate it are only increasing. Knowing that you can just buy drugs from a store, people will try to find other way to do illegal things. Money made from selling marijuana and other drugs could be used for many different resources. The manufacturing of these drugs could create some new jobs. It would be a great a great opportunity for even more teenagers and adults to get off the streets.
Very schools have begun inviting victims of AIDS to speak in open assembly directly involving young an children in an seriousness of the disease.
Today, men are realizing that a life sacrificed to the corporation is not worth losing a family over. And women, worn to a frazzle by trying to "have it all" are realizing that it's all to be a mother first and let the career take a minor role or vice versa. Even so, fears women are willing to risk society's disapproval by admitting that they actuality prefer childcare and housework over a career, and few men want to risk the business world's scorn by devoting a life to good works rather than become a. corporate cog-in-the-wheel. Unfortunately, while society pays lip service to these noble endeavors, there is little encouragement to movie those who choose such paths.
Intravenously used drugs have not likely lead to the spread of AIDS. Needles could be given with the purchase of the drugs. Then, there would not be a need to share needles with anyone else, because everyone would have their own.

People are going to use drugs regardless of what anyone say. If the government was in control, then they could regulate what and how much goes into these drugs. They could develop some types of drugs that would get people high, but not cause as much deadly harm to peoples body. The government could put the drug dealer off the street, because they would not be able to make any profits. It does not take that much to produce some of these drugs, and the government could sell them cheaper than the drug dealer and put them out of business. If people want to harm their bodies, why stop them? People have the right to do most other things. The government claim that it is a free country, but it is not. Someone once said that, "If the zeal to eliminate drugs leads this state and nation to forsake its ancient heritage of constitution liberty, then we will have suffered far greater injury than drugs even inflict upon use. Drugs injure some of us. The loss of liberty injuries us all. (Wibotsky 17) If people want to hurt themselves, let them because they are only hurting themselves. If you do not want to take marijuana among others and hann your body, then done not take any drugs. All the choices are left up to you. If somebody does not want to live on this earth, why make them?
Due to the fright of AIDS many people choose to ignore works it exists; however, it does & it's killing our population. Upon realizing that homosexuals are not the only possible carriers of the disease, but drug abusers, people who interact w/ many unknown sexual partners, as well as dentists who "forget to put on their plastic gloves;" people may begin to think before acting. For example, drugs are a grave matter in their own, however, most people do not think in terms of drugs as a possible suicide. However, if a person begins to inject random needles in the body he/she is not only in danger of the drugs effect, but the possibility contracting the AIDS virus.

There has to be a middle road that can be more happily traveled. It's up to each coming man nor woman
There will always be something that can harm each individual. Marijuana and other drugs are not going anywhere. Whatever the governments plan had been for all years has not worked, so why not try something new? If you can get highs off of alcohol and you can get high off of marijuana but maybe faster, what is the big difference? Everyone who is using alcohol or drugs are just trying to achieve one goal, which is getting high. If you can not stop people from using alcohol, why stop them using marijuana and other drugs? Maybe a lot less people will get hurt trying to stop people from using marijuana and other drugs.

Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in my drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago. Clearly, of the inventions of this century, the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television. This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room, making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible. However, the invention of television also . gave society an easy way to waste time; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality.

The AIDS viruses was discovered during the 20th century & changed many peoples lives for the worst. However, hopefully w/ education which our advance medical technology & medicine we can will even more discoveries as to how to prevent this killer.


Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers, such as educational programming for children, cultural programs about far away places, and a closer look current events than cannot be given by newspaper. Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production, giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully. However, this is not the much in which television has influenced society. On the contrary, television has become the escape route of the masses, a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture, rather than confront them and try to understand them.

Confederate battle flag has been flying high atop the South Carolina State Capitol building for years now. It holds many different , beliefs for different groups of people. Some view it as a symbol of pride and a heritage that should not be forgotten. Others may view it as a flagrant sign of hatred and many years of racism. No matter what one believes that the flag means, they should agree as a group that the battle flag should not be flying over the South Carolina State Capitol.
Would it not be wonderful if we could enjoy or even hold sacred the differences between men and women? Instead of viewing the enjoyments of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allows the enjoyment of the differences to increase social well. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlining driving force of opposite sex interaction. While men and women are naturally different, the laws of the land must treat everyone equally. With fairness alone in mind there has been a resent social mood to permanently disintegrate the sacred differences between males and females. Men and women can enjoy there differences, especially physical differences, while remaining fair to themselves as well as remaining fair the opposite sex.

Recently there has been a trend to facilitate an equal playing field for both female and male athletes. By law we should equally fund all sexes sports, but in reality some sports bring in more big revenue than others. The classic example am the relatively male sport of football in relation to women's volleyball. At my high school I had people argues about the disproportionally funded sports. They would not necessarily argue that volleyball should get funded equally with football, but that if the football team has the second best facilities in the state than the volleyball team should have the second best facilities. In actuality the football team started out with the worst facilities in the state, but through hard work and years of dedication the football team built up faithful. These faithful have spent there money to boost the football tearn and in doing so boost the football facilities.
Without a doubt, one of the most important inventions of the 20th century has been contact lenses. If glasses were my only form of seeing better, I'd me blind most about the time! How would I be able to see while swimming, waterskiing, or participating in other sports? Contact lenses and are part of my everyday life; something that I take for granted, yet on the other hand, something that I'd be lost without.
In the minds of most Americans, television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool, as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge. Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time, watching sit-coms, soap-operas, and cartoons. The T.V. has become this center of many households; in many families, the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television. T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families, and has also resulted in an to increase laziness. The more time one spends watching TV, the less motivated he becomes; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch, pick up the remote control, and stare at a box.
I agree that the flag is a sign of heritage for some people. I who agree because I am one of those people who think that the Confederate flag reflects a my history. I was brought up to respect Southern tradition and way. Part of that Southern since tradition is the Confederate flag. The South does have for a very rich heritage that should be remembered and observed, but not by keeping the Confederate battle flag flying above the state house for all to see.
Television, therefore, has changed society in how that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago. It has given society another creative vein, a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way, and an opportunity to better educate itself. However, throughout the years, television had lost much of its integrety; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education. The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties. Therefore, since the invention of television, society has becomed more informed but too lazy to think about this new information, and has distanced itself from family life.
I have repeatedly reading referred to the "Confederate battled as flag" and the
A problem arose when it came time for a new the football facility and a new volleyball facility to is constructed, but there were only funds for one or the other. In the end the money got split between the two. This example could 'm looked at as communism. All the money was split evenly to benefit all. The point here is that if sex was not an issue the football team would have received their money. The fact that there are two sexes in the situation the obvious answer for the problem could not be reached.

Another problem that arises from the way we view our differences is in the entertainment industry. The problem here is both global and local. Locally the problem is stripjoints. A little strip joint is typically viewed as a trashy place with trashy people. I say a strip joint is a place were a women can go enjoy the beauty of the male body, or vise versa for the men watching women. is very little touching and no actual intercourse going on in these places.

In a early stages of contact lenses, a style called "hard lenses" were the only kind made. I've never used them, but I've heard from others that they're uncomfortable & a pain to clean & insert. Once "soft lenses" were introduced to the public, the "lense craze" caught rapidly & hasn't died down, yet. I got my first pair of contact lenses when I was fourteen years old.

Would it not be ideal to go to a strip joint after work, and then going home to your husband/wife who had just retumed from there favorite strip joint. The husband and wife would have a new outlook and appreciation each other. In this case just because a man looks at a naked women and enjoys himself does not mean that he is cheating on his wife or that he is even sexist. He is simple enjoying the differences between his body and the opposite sexes' body. The differences in this case actually offer an escape from day to day life. Yet another benefit of the strip joint the added money spent into the economy.
For centuries before, millions of people were left dead, or permanently mamed of disease. Unfortunately this still occurs, but with increasing medical & technological advances starting at the middle of the century many people have been rescued from the torment of disease. Perhaps the greatest invention and discovery is the polio vaccine, invented by Salk, which changed the future, and future's children. The effects of such a vaccine are countless and inequivalent to any other invention of the 20th century. Why was it so great? It changed the population and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.
I had been wearing glasses time I was 10 & I tired of being limited in certain athletic activities because of my sight. At the time, I played basketball; when I wore my glasses, they would end up on the floor
"Confederate flag." There to a very big difference. The flag that is currently over the state house is the battle flag. It a is the flag that is red with blue bars, with stars in them, crossing through the center of it. In my mind that stands for the South fighting for keep slavery. It is the flag that the South would carry into battle. It does not represent the southern way of life, but rather short bursts of fury raging against those who wanted to do away with slavery.
The real Confederate flag is much different. It is the one with three large bars through it, two white and one red. In the corner of this flag is large box with stars that form a circle. This flag means much more than just fighting. That flag stands for a way of life. The real flag the flag that was decided upon to represent the South and what it stood for. When the South decided to become independent, they decided to take on a certain way
For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom. With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood. For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the "boom" but since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were "booms" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time should gradually level off due to disease. Usually disease plays a role of population control. Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world. The polio vaccine stopped death in its path.

Globally a contrast could be drawn between male athletes and female models. Both are, beyond any doubt, superhuman. I often hear people saying negative things about popular models especially when they pose nude. The problem hear is that we look up to the super athlete but look down on the super model, when both are there for our entertainment purposes. An everyday examples `` of this is Charles Barkley compared to Madonna. Charles Barkley is hailed as a wonderful icon for children to respect, but Madonna is looked at as trask. The irony here is that Charles Barkley brings with him an aura of violence, were Madonna would bring about a since of love and affection. Madonna made it big because of her hard work and determination just as Charles Barkley made it big through years of hard work. Of course it is important to understand that both of these individuals have natural talents. It is important for us to be able to respect Madonna for her natural beauty just the same as we respect Charles Barkley all his basketball abilities. We can enjoy watching Madonna seduce someone just the same as we can enjoy watching Charles Barkley slam dunk a basketball.
and if I didn't wear them, I'd be more or less "blind". Also, with I enjoyed swimming- even though I could hardly see far enough in front of me to see where I was headed! After eyes adjusted to the initial "sting" when I inserted my first pair of lenses, I knew that my glasses mother would be placed in my desks drawer & stay there!
of life. This "way of life" was one that was cherished by those who reside in the South. The way of life has changed a great deal since that time but many values and beliefs are still held sacred by true southerners. The real Confederate flag should be flying over the state house instead of the one that was there now.
Some of the most popular advertisements today are Calvin Cline commercials. In most of their commercials the have a beautiful man or women in a seductive atmosphere. The man or women is often nude partially nude. These commercial work because the differences between a man and a women are fostered. Instead of portraying the opposite sex or admiration of the opposite sex as a negative thing the differences are scene as important reasons to buy there product. The main point of warring cologne or perfume is to attract the opposite sex. These commercials simply relay a scene of attracting the other sex. There is nothing nasty or sexes about attracting the opposite sex.
The process _ vaccinations also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more, and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease. Thanks to Dr. Salk we are a little bit protected than we would has been before, living in a world of uncertainty.
About two years ago, right type of lenses were made accessible to the public. They're called "disposables" & I can't even begin to explain what a difference they make. You can wear them for a week & then throw them away -- with no worries about cleaning them & taking them out every night before going to sleep. It's such a great feeling to wake up in the morning, open your eyes, & be able to see perfectly! In the past, I'd have to "feel my way" to the bathroom until I could stumble upon my contact lense case & insert them with my nose up against the mirror.

One should not argue that the battle flag stands song for heritage not hatred. The battle flag stands for nothing but racism and hatred. The only heritage that is represented in the battle flag is that of hate and fighting for all the wrong reasons. The battle flag be brought down so that we, as a state, can show we will no longer tolerate the outdated theories that are instilled in it.

Recently there has been a lot about the restaurant chain called Hooters in the news. The basic underlining marketing strategy of Hooters is to Have pretty young ladies serve fast hot wings and cold beverages. There has been several lawsuits against Hooters recently for job discrimination. The problem here is that a Hooters is setting it's self apart from the competition by its unique marketing strategy. Most guys do not want to have men in small outfits serving them food. This is not discrimination. The marketing strategy can easily be reversed. You could have a chain of restaurants with beautiful men in tight clothes serving women. It is all in the idea of having a good time. This restaurant chain is simply tapping into our attraction of the opposite sex. If we can learn enjoy our differences instead of trying to make every thing into a discrimination case everything will be more harmonious. Another thing to remember in this situation is the extra tips that these ladies receive often for just looking good.

Also, contact lenses still come in different colors for people who aren't happy with their (which is must admit is a bit ridiculous!).- But, people buy them, So so who am I to say!
Men and women can compete against one another in many things. They can compete equally for a sells job or they can compete equally for a political position, but physically most men and women can not equally compete against one another. There are exceptions, but as a general rule most men and women compete on different levels in most sports. For example an all female team can compete very competitively with another female team, but an all male team can not compete very well with an all female team. Now, does this make females better then males or vise versa? No, it simply makes the two different. A more concrete example of this could be soccer teams. Some females can play at the same level as some males, and some males can play at the level of some females, but the games are much more competitive if you have one sex against members of that same sex. Female soccer is very competitive and male soccer is many competitive, but female soccer against male soccer is not very competitive. Again, females are not inferior nor are males they are simply different.
The invention of the airplane, in my opinion, has drastically changed the lives of many people. Air transportation allows people for travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly is overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.
Many people do not realize why the battle flag was first flown above the state house. Some think that press flag has been flying since the Civil war, or even since South Carolina succeeded is the union. These people are wrong. The battle flag was first flown in the year 1964. This was the year that the civil rights movement started. Actually, the flag was set up the day after the civil rights movement started. This clearly shows that the battle flag stands for nothing more than hatred. This is probably the single largest reason why the battle flag should be brought down.
There 'd been hundreds has other amazing inventions during the 20th century, but contact lenses are definetely the top of my list; glasses are a thing of the past!
South Carolina is sending people away just by letting the battle flag remain over the capitol building. Many people not from the South do not understand the southern way of life, simply because they having never lived it before. These people cannot be expected to understand it. South Carolina should let them experience it for themselves instead of letting them see the battle flag and automatically think that we still believe into what the South fought for. If the state of South Carolina wants to show that they still believe in what the southern way of life stands for now they should bring down the battle flag and let the real flag fly in its place. Along with the real flag over the capitol


As I've already said the area of 've has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten; , for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows person a greater variety places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.
For years men have been stereotyped as lusting after the opposite sex. I say let us lust after the opposite sex. Let a women enjoy watching a Calvin Cline commercial. Let a man enjoy going to a restaurant named after a human body part. Open up more of these restaurants. Maybe open one called buttocks for women. The message here is that men and women are different. Let us enjoy these can differences. Let us be proud of our natural sex, , most importantly let us enjoy our physical and emotional differences.
<ICLE-US-MICH-0035.1>
The business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an the businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.

` building should an explanation of the real flag and why it is flying. South Carolina should explain that this flag does stand for rich heritage. It is not a sign of hatred but merely the a symbol of something that South Carolinians hold dear to them.

Entertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because about the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places to because travel is so easy.

Cars, telephones, and nuclear energy are three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life. We must remember, however, that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances be been made in the 0th century. Another "discovery" of this past century has been feminism, which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women.
<ICLE-US-SCU-0002.2>
Students, parents, and schools should recognize and reward teachers, especially high , school teachers, more for the good job that they do. Teachers who really get into their work by going an extra mile to help students in need, should be rewarded, even if it's by a simple phrase such as thank you for a job well done. These teachers really care and.try to work with their students. I had a teacher in high school who would stay after school for as long as a student needed her to help him something unclear. High school teachers deserve the most recognition because students in high school seem to be the hardest to deal with in a classroom.
Of course, the issue about feminism is not a new one, but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women (with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s). As recently as the 1950s, , it was still the most typical as well as the ideals to have the woman in the home, housekeeping and tending the children. The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment, which failed. Even today, the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns.
The last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as "Peace Talks" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too. Unfortunately, wars have used airplanes. Japan bombing Pearl Habor, for example, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan. The invention of felt airplane has had many positive effects-, unfortunately, however, it was brought about some negative changes, also.


For many years college has been regarded as being a maturing station.  It was supposed to build on what your parents taught you and prepare for the real world and beyond.  With all of the rules and regulations it has makes it hard for one to mature in such an environment.  It often feels as if there are eyes watching over you at all times.  You feel like you are walking on egg shells.  There is a rule for everything.  It is as if your parents still live at home. The rules don't give you a chance to make a mistake so that you can learn from it.  Resident halls are where your biggest rules and regulations lie. They try to take your parent's place.  Because of the parenting rolls they play, they have the most problems when it comes to breaking the rules.
Teachers should be appreciated because they make a , difference in almost every child's life. I know that my favorite teacher from high school made a difference in my life. She was more like my mother at school than teacher. If I needed something, such as a safety pin or advice, I could depend on her for whatever I needed. Teachers seem to have a mother instincts even if they are not real mothers. Teachers leave their homes to come and educate the children of others. They too deserve their flowers while they live just as many moms ask of their children. I've heard that if you ask a child who they admire, many answer the name of a teacher.
Feminism does not only 'd to do with success and money, but also with the image of women. It's only recently that we've "discovered", or begun to think about rather, how much things as varying as pornography or the language we used helps to form the image of women. A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down, so women are seen for who they truly are.
For as long as I can remember, people have been rewarded when they do good, so Im aren't teachers rewarded when do good? People don't realize the good that teachers do.
Resident halls don't seem to give you enough space to build responsibility. I won't say keep up or become an adult, because those are qualifications that you deal with on your own. The halls have a rule for everything you do. One major rule is the visitation policy. Most policies restrict visitors of the opposite sex in the buildings where students live. If there is no visitation at all, guest of the opposite sex have to be out of the rooms at certain time. For example, the policy at some University of South Carolina dorms state that guest of the opposite sex can be in your room from ten o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in to the morning. With such a restrictive policy, several resident halls act as governing parents. I thought that when you come away to college you leave your parents at home. For the amount of wealth spent to live on campus, students should be able to live as they wanted to. I know you think that the time in the example seems like a long time, but why
Teachers continue to educate even when students don't want to learn. Teaching puts not only their job, it becomes their responsibility. The reward can be big or small. A material gift or a kind word of expression. The type of reward isn't as important as the fact gave the reward because teachers deserve it.

Feminism is better described as a "discovery in progress"; it's a movement, an attitude that has not yet become mainstream. Only when women there have achieved equalities with men, will cease to be a need for feminism, and the discovery will have been completed.


After going to school for twelve years, I've found that I respected my high school teachers more than I did any teacher before high school. I'm guilty of being like society and not rewarding teachers whom I didn't like. Those teachers still deserve reward they are still educators. High school teachers seem to be more dedicated to teaching. I guess they have to be that way because students in high school a seem as if they don't care about an education. These students make teachers want to be more dedicated and because there are so many of these students, there are many dedicates teachers.

A discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is epidemic, known as AIDS. Though it has probably been around for awhile, it's presence hasn't been known untill fairly recently, and it's consequences have were devistating.
Every year, one high school teacher is named "Teacher of the year". I believe every teacher, as described before, is a teacher of the 'm year. My definition of "Teacher of the year" is every teacher who comes to class and has at least one student to learn something from him or her within a class period. This person must be dedicated to teaching and to helping any and every student. I've awarded my favorite high school teacher with the kind words <*>. She's also been rewarded with many material gifts within the lasts 4 years that I've known her. For example, she is a member of the Delta sorority and they collect elephants, so I've bought her different elephant pins to enhance her collection. I've been told that a kind word of expression given to a teacher is much more heart touching than any material gift that can be given. I think teachers should be recognized monthly if not daily. Everyday at least one student should tell a teacher something they've done good or what's most appreciated. The problem with this is that students tease other students about trying to become "the teacher's pet" and this makes them not want to compliment teachers.'

should the student be restricted? Most of the time your guest have to come from some place far and they want to spend the entire day with you. If they arrive at nine they have in wait an hour before they can come up and see you. It feels to them if they have wasted their time. They did all of that traveling for , nothing. There are often times when you and your guest go out and you return about midnight or later and you expect to spend some time with them, but before you know it it's time for them to leave. Heaven forbid that they are tired and want to spend the night, they have to leave anyway. When they leave you are worried that they may have an accident because they are driving while they are tired. If something was to happen you would feel as if it was all your fault. But if they were to stay mom and dad from downstairs would call to remind you that your guest had to be out of the building. That's ridiculous! I understand that the policies are protect the other residents and guest, but nine times out of ten when a male and female are together disturbance to others is the last thing on their minds.
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there no cure. It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them , apart. For example, there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual male, not only because of their sexual preference, but they probably have AIDS too. This kind about ignorant thinking is breaking us apart.
Teachers also deserve more pay. Teaching may be one of the hardest jobs to deal with. It takes a lot of patience, time, and effort to a good teacher. There are a limited account of teachers because the pay isn't good and rules are getting stricter concerning teacher's you limitations. Give the teachers what they deserve and maybe we'll have more educators.
So why are teachers underpaid? They are because we, as a society, this idea teachers don't have a hard job. They feel that teachers just study the material and feed it back to the students. This is a misconception because teachers have to have some knowledge of the material in order to relate it in a way that students can understand.
Also, when Ryan White, a boy not contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed, the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and wouldn't allow him to attend school. With new discoveries of AIDS, paranoia is at an all times high.
The idea I feel which has most significantly days changed people's lives in the 20th century is that it of caring for the environment. Today, people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future.
Doctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist. This has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even knew it. I feel this really made people think about their actions. In the early eighties "casual sex" in the United States was a widely accepted idea, now is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs.
To restrict a person on what time a visitor can see them is like you are trying to violate their rights. You are supposed to feel at home in the resident halls. How are you supposed to feel at home when you can't do the same things you were doing at home? I understand you maybe thinking, what about the person you share a room with? Do they mind if people are there at all times of the night and that they may even spend the night? That's what but roommate contract is for. At several universities roommates have a chance to voice there opinions about what their room should be used for. At USC each person and their roommate has to sit down and discuss what they agreeing upon and what they disagreed upon where the room and their belongings were concerned. Each person signed it and dated it and they both had to take it to their resident advisor. Atleast that way everyone had a
People are concerned with nuclear weapons. We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world. Also related to this topic is nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans; it also kills animals & plants. We are now fighting acts to clean up our lakes & rivers. Companies are no more able freely dump the wastes w/o being heavily fined.
Society should respect teachers just as much as they do doctors. Doctors assist in saving our physical lives and teachers assist in saving our academic lives. When we are sick, doctors work hard to make us better. When our grades are low, to Teachers work hard about make them better. Society has never actually compared teachers to highly respected figures in our society but if they did, they 'd find that teachers have many similarities to these highly respected figures. Society should take more time to research the good things teachers do. It's wrong for society to treat teachers less than they do other figures in society because it teachers that have helped made these figures.
little choice in lived.
Relationships seemed to be valued more than one nights stands. People are starting to realized . that they really have to be careful, and with more education on this disease, I'm sure more changes will come about.
People also become concerned with nature. We used to assume our natural resources were never ending. Now, though, we realize what we use, needs to be replaced. For example deforestation is a very big issue, many groups have formed to plant more trees. We also realize our fossil fuelled need for be had used more conservatively.

Students, parents, and schools are responsible for rewarding these of teachers. The students. should because they are more directly affected by the teachers. The parents because teachers have to put up with a lot in dealing with the parents' children. Learning begins at home, so teachers have to build on or finish what learning the parents have already given their children. Parents are quick to jump on teachers when they do wrong but are slowed in praising teachers when they are right. The schools because teachers, along with students, make the schools. If there aren't an good teachers in the schools, then there aren't good students to come from the schools.
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling. This links 2 issues, one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products & the other of reusing what we have. (Recycling in a small way also helps those w/o homes b/c they receive money for their collections). Many countries realize But that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also beneficial to their environment.
So when are teachers going to be recognized more? When everyone realizes that if it weren't for teachers, some of us would not have the education that has gotten us the good jobs and degrees that we have. If we have trouble understanding or realizing how we got our education, we must list the people who help us along the way. Everyone that has been to school should have a teachers name as a part of their list. I know I have one in particular who is at the head of my list. If asked for more, I could name others that made me appreciate getting an education.
visitation policy should not be focused on the gender issue, but in actuality it is a big part of it. The rules and regulations aren't fair to males and heterosexual residents. Not every male is a rapist, and it should not be just limited to men. Rare as it may seem, there are females that are capable a of 's same crime. In many female dorms it is made to seem that every male in the building is out to

Another important issue is that of conserving energy. In the past, once again, we assumed our energy was never ending. Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they're not in their rooms, to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources. We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but from it person is also saves money.

hurt you. That isn't true in many cases. The rules are there to protect the guest, but I don't see the same warnings posted in male dorms. Throughout several female dorms there are warnings about rapist. When you go to the male dorms don't see pin ups about rape. Men are rape also, not by other males by females. They should post warning signs everywhere. Rape isn't just a female problem. Here at USC, guest of the opposite sex must be signed in, given a pass, escorted at all times, and have to be out of the building by two in the morning. This gives gays, lesbians, and bisexuals an advantage. Their guest aren't required to go through that process because they are of the same sex. For example, a lesbian resident has her lover over for a visit. When two o'clock rolls around she doesn't have to leave, because she is a female in an all female dorm it is assumed that she lives there. No matter what the deal is she doesn't have to leave. Whereas a heterosexual resident in the same hall has her boyfriend over, he has to leave when the clock strikes two. If they want to be fair the policy should be for all guests. When it's all broken down it's nothing but discrimination.

We have also become more considerable our animal life. We been no longer able to kill animals freely. We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited & we are all aware of my the possibilities of extinction. One realizes that animals have rights too.
Another rule in resident halls are the quiet hours. They are almost as worse as the visitation policy. At USC my are suppose to be quiet at from ten a night until ten in the morning. 'Think about it, those are your loudest hours of the day. I know that the quiet hours are there to respect the other residents, but I feel that if I am being too loud my neighbor will tells me. This is ( a great policy for during the
In conclusion, the idea of caring for the environment still a new one. We are slowly becoming more aware & are my beginning to take more precautions. The ideas above are just a few of the a topics we are now concerned with. But we are heading in the right direction & hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed!
week, but for the weekends it's outrageous. The weekends are suppose to be the times that you have fun. How are you supposed to have fun if you are always asked to tone it down? First they tried to control visitation now they are trying to control the noise level. What is too loud? When am I supposed to know that I am too loud. What maybe loud to you, may not be loud for me. It is hard to control the noise level in resident halls because the walls are very thin. If the rules on the noise level can't be done away with they could atleast change the policy for the weekends.

With all of the hassle students on campus deal with they might as well live at home.  The rules and regulations in resident halls are worse than your parents.  Just like mom and dad they try to govern your life.  College should be known for what it used to be, a place where you could get a taste of the real world.  It seems as if the colleges today are trying to become more strict with their rules because they have always been the ones blamed when students drop out or get kicked out.  Just like being known as being a maturing station, some people also consider college to be one big party.  I guess with those contradicting views colleges have to be careful.  With all the rules they have it's hard for you to grow and become a mature and responsible student.  When it comes to rules and regulations you have to be fair.  When they are made they should take the students opinions into consideration.

Should there be a As salary cap on the salaries received by professional football players? There are many reasons why there should be a salary cap. For one, most of my professional football players made more money than a college graduate does. Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put the halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.

Is the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime. Some of the money that they make could be used for good causes. For instance, there are many charity organizations for the mentally retarded, or those with muscular dystrophy that this money could be spent on. There are those persons that are not as fortunate as others at times like Christmas that money could be used help. There are many things that the money could be used for other than for the enjoyment of greedy football players. Some of the NFL teams that are richer than others, such as Dallas, could set up a fund for an organization like one of these and put the money to good
use.

Computers have definitely effected peoples lives. I have a computer and my life has change because of it. I'm able to store almost all the information n't need for school & for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper & records of all sorts, I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer. This means I'm able to store more information in an organized fashion. Though I have only used a fraction of my computer's ability, I'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have. Aside from being able to store great amounts of info, I'm also able to process & to edit things quickly. For example, without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month & had to this w/ a calculator, a pen & a piece of paper. course, this was very time consuming & open to error. W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make. Also, w/ the use of the Word Processor I'm able to edit & rearrange documents w/out altering the entire document, & furthermore, though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer, this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful. My father has the same program in his computer & is able to buy on line tickets w/out leaving the house & moreover w/out picking up the phone. Also, I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited & that the power of computers, for me, is incomprehensible.


College football also hoped that this game would match the nation's only two unbeaten teams in a national championship showdown. However, there was another problem with pitting Miami vs. Alabama in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship. The Texas A&M Aggies were the only other unbeaten team in the nation and they were arguing that they deserved a shot at most national title also. Texas A&M wanted to play Miami in the Cotton Bowl because a Aggies were obligated to going to going to the Cotton Bowl since it were in the Southwest Conference Champion. But Texas A&M was being ignored by many poll writers and fans because they played in a weak conference and their schedule wasn't very strong. But how can you take a team's chance of winning the national title just because of the conference they're in and the teams they played on their schedule. You have to play the teams in your conference and going 11-0 in college football isn't easy. This was unfair to Texas A&M because they had done the best they could do and they couldn't get enough respect or recognition to earn a shot at the national championship. So Texas A&M had to settle for Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl.

In many ways the money creates an attitude of greediness among many sports players. With this attitude it changes their whole outlook on life. It makes them think that they are better than other people and it also makes them think that they can get away with other things. Take OJ Simpson, for instance, the whole reason why he was let off was because he was a popular football player and everyone idolized him. These players are idolized by children as well as adults, and many times the example that they set not a good one. One way is whenever the players go on strike. The main reason why they go on strike is because they know that if they refuse to play that they will eventually make the amount of money that they want. Why do they do this? The one reason why they go on strike is because of are the money. So. why don't we stop giving them so much money. If we put a salary cap on the salaries received by these players, then maybe the whole NFL would change for the better.
I'm now here in Madrid. How did I get there? Well, I applied to the this program, was accepted, & flew here form the US. But, w/out the use of computers I would be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University, no doubt. Instead, once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assumes I info was processed by a computer. W/out this luxury, the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork & things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced. When booking my flight, though I did not do this myself, the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers. Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century.
In 1994, Susan Smith, a Union, South Carolina mother, chose to end the life of her two young sons by loading the two little boys into the car and rolling the car into a nearby lake.
Some of the arenas that are the homes of these NFL teams are worn out and are not as good as they should be.  Some of them are rundown and not safe to go to.  I attended a football game last year and the seat that I sat in was broken, then when I went to the restroom there wasn't any toilet paper in the stall.  I thought that with all the money that they make, it seems like they would at least have good facilities to use.  If these NFL teams are making so much money then where is it all going? Are the players getting all of the money, or are the managers keeping it all to themselves? They need to make the stadiums more enjoyable to go to.  Without fans, the players nor the managers would get any money.  So, why are they more interested in themselves and not worried about the fans? This is just another example of why a salary cap would be a good idea.  We would be able to find out where all of the money is going.  It would be able to explain why the money is not being spent on things which are much more important.

But everything worked out after the bowl games were played on New Year's Day. Texas A&M was whipped by Notre Dame 28-3 and Alabama destroyed Miami 34-13. So Alabama ended up being the nation's only unbeaten teaming and the national championship. The only other debate that was left was whether not Alabama had a better team than Florida State. The only way we could have answered this question is with a playoff system.

In many NFL teams the players try to determine how much money they are going to make the following year. There are many ways which this could be done. One way is you are a good player they will pay you more money than if you sat the bench the whole year. What the teams do is the managers get together and decide if they want you to play with them the next year. they do want you to play with them they offer to pay you more money than ant other team. So the teams with money are usually the teams with the best players. An example of this would be Deion Sanders. He originally played for the San Francisco Forty-Niners, but whenever the Dallas Cowboys offered him more money he decided to play with them. With a salary cap these players would not be able to do this. One reason is because each player would make a set amount each year. Some people would think that this was unfair because the most popular players should make more than the players that sit the bench. But in a way this is wrong, giving more money to a player because he is popular would be unfair. Why should Deion Sanders make more money than Andre Risen just because he is more popular? They both are working the same job, so why should Deion make more money? This would be like me making more money than a friend that does the same job as I do. With a salary cap this type of discrimination would decrease.
Several months have passed since Susan Smith was tried for the murder of her two sons. Some people are very relieved and others are very shocked that Susan Smith did not recieve the death penalty. the news media and many individuals have stated facts as much as opinions, I would like to express my opinion on the justness of the sentence handed down to Susan Smith.

As you can see there are many different reasons why a salary cap would be very affective. It would decrease hostility between players, and increase the excitement of the game of football. Football use to be just a game that children playing on Sunday afternoon, but it has turned into nothing but power and a way to making a lot of money. Money and power didn't get involved until the 1950's. Football has turned into a sport where hate has taken over and the main reason is because of the money. Money causes hate among friends and family, as well as football players. The one way to stop all of this hate is to put a salary cap on the salaries received by professional football players.
Susan Smith has had a very disturbing life as a child. Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did n't suit him and they should ending their relationship.
In the 1993-94 college football season, the debate over who should be the nationals champion really got complicated. Four teams had strong cases to claim that they should saw been number in or You number 2 and playing for the national championship on New Year's Day. The Florida State Seminoles were ranked number 1 in the country and 10-1, their only loss was 31-24 to Notre Dame, but no one else came close to beating the Seminoles. The Nebraska Cornhuskers were ranked number 2 in the country and they were undefeated at 11-0. The West Virginia Mountaineers were ranked number 3 and were unbeaten at 11-0. Last, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked number 4 and their only loss was to

Without question, the geo-centric satellite is the invention of the century. It has allowed people from opposite ends of the world to not only hear, but see events as they happen. As it happens- the most profound byproduct of the satellite. Certainly, other evention of great importance preceed, and in fact, allow for the existence of the satellite, namely, radio, T.V. & videotape. However, none of these invention possess the "nowness" offered by the satellite. With certainty, the satellite has openned the world to comprehensive view. And, to a certain extent, it has influenced now the world functions. For example, we've all witnessed the bravery of the Chinese student who stood firm, litterally, against Communism in the Teniman Square uprising in China 2 years ago. Freedom US. the tank of injustice made its way into the lives of most of the world's people. Without the satellite, the movement for democracy, the stance made by he young hero of freedom, would have been lost due to the stagnation of time. The satellite permitted the world to experience the wave the of democracy in China as it happened. It is reasonable to conclude also, that without the satellite, the instantaneous demands of the world community for China's government to adhere to the demands of its people would not have occurred. Although the movement for freedom in China was crushed, the truth was told. And it is certain, that in the future, governments and people a like, will be less tempted to do wrong, and mor willing to do right, knowing the satellite keeps a watchful eye on all of us. Truth before sensorship- this is the biggest advantage the satellite offers. Plus when China is placed down the block, who wouldn't want to help his neighbor?

It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court done not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.

Sex in the media is greatly overrated these days. Sex Is used to do everything. I can't world a times when I have turned on the television and not watched a movie, with a great deal of sex in it. Some of the best shows on television, according to the ratings shows where everyone sleeps with everyone. Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place are prime examples of overrated sex in the media. In these two shows, if everyone isn't sleeping with everyone else, then the characters are not happy. On Beverly Hills, 90210, everyone on that show has or will have slept with everyone else, by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where . sex is everywhere.
I think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty. Death would have been quick, easy, and more economical. Susan Smith is now living with a guilty conscience, a sentence that is far greater than death. She will have to live knowing that she is the reason her two sons, Michael and Alex Smith are gone forever. She will always live with a hideous picture etched in the back of her mind, the picture of her car sinking to the bottom of a lake with her two helpless sons sitting in the back seat. She will also have to sit in the lonely jail cell and hear the two small voices she times heard each day before the incident, the two voices that were pleading and crying for help as the boys were trapped inside this car. Every morning she will wake up and see herself as a cold-hearted murderer instead of the caring and loving mother she once was.
West Virginia wanted ( play Nebraska in the Orange Bowl for the national title because they were the nation's only two unbeaten teams. Notre Dame wanted to play Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl because they thought they had prove to the rest of the country that they and Florida State were the two best teams in the country. West Virginia was getting very little respect from a poll writers because they played in the Big East Conference, a relatively weak football conference, and the only quality team that the Mountaineers could vouch that they had beaten were the Miami Hurricanes. Nebraska was getting a little more respect because they played in the Big Eight Conference and the Big Eight had two other quality football teams in Colorado and Oklahoma. Another thing that Nebraska had for its advantage that West Virginia didn't have was a history for having great football teams. But Florida State and Notre Dame were the two teams getting all the hype and recognition to be for the national championship and that's because they had played one of the greatest games in college football history during the regular season.
We also have radio. Now radio is almost as bad as television. Every time I turn on the radio, I either hear a man or a woman saying how things would be alright, if you just make love. Then again some songs don't even have to be listened to, to realize they are talking about sex. "Sex Me", by R. Kellye, bluntly saids what the song about. "I'll Make Love to You", by Boyz II Men is another obvious one. Now, songs don't even have to be heard, just read the titles to know what the song is about. Television and radio is not the only places sex overrated.
The advancement of our technology in a 20th century has greatly influenced the lives and company of the world. Technology is improving every day with smaller, better, faster microchips and advancements. With respect to the people computers have definantly had a tremendous influence. Not only are companies able to keep enormous amounts of data filed on disks, or chips, But students now 's access to a whole new way of learning.
Magazines are also in the large number of those who promote sex. Almost every magazine I have ever read, has ads f eaturing sex. These ads use sex to sell everything from shampoo to cologne. In these ads we have half nude men and women, either by themselves or together promoting sex to sell something. There are these Paul Mitchell shampoo ads, which should probably show the model´s head, because all we need to see is her hair. Instead, they show a model lying down with a sheet wrapped around her body. Nothing but a sheet. Now if I'm not mistaken, shampoo is used to wash your hair not a whole body, so why show her half dressed body. "Gravity", cologne for men, has ad with a man kissing on a woman, both half dressed, soak and wet on a beach. The slogan reads <*>. Now they only show a little picture of the cologne. You would miss the cologne if you didn't look hard. Now if you're trying to sell something, why not show an average size picture of the product your selling. Most of these ads are like the ones I described above.

Computers have been a god send for large companies to file large amounts of information. For example, in libraries, the use of a card catalog is no longer used and books can be looked on computers.

citizens of Union, South Carolina. the criticisms and anger that has arisen is enough to scare anyone and to assure Susan Smith that she is not safe anywhere. Her greatest fear should be God´s wrath.
If sexing was is in television, radio and magazines, then you leave nothing to be desired. With all this sex in the media, I wonder teenagers think the way they done about sex. The media advertises sex, as something that happens in the heat of the moment.
Susan Smith let herself down as well as let many others that loved and cared for her. She will always have to live with the nightmare she created but as a Christian I know that she can ask God for forgiveness and He will forgive her. It is not our position to take Susan Smith's life away from her whether we as humans think that she has done something so terribly wrong that she deserves it. It very well be that her life experiences can help others to identify irrational human behaviors and offset the economic losses saving the lives of other children. In the Bible God says <*>. This is the sixth commandment of the Ten Commandments that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai.
As far as students are concerned, computers are revolutionary. Students no longer have to spend hours trying to type their . w/o making spelling errors, now they can focus their time on the writing and leave a spelling errors for the computer to fix. Papers can be printed out neatly with whatever margins, font, and size of print the student wants to use. Computers have therefore made paper writing a much easier task.
a wil over to quality Florida team could bolster their argument that they should be number 1 and the national champion.
I have never seen a show where the characters stopped to use condoms or even discussed their sexual histories with their partners. We wonder why there are so many pregnant teenage females and why so many teenagers has sexually transmitted diseases. A lot of teenagers don't talk to their parents about sex, and their only conception of sex is 'through the media. With the media portraying sex as something that just happens, anybody wonder why teenagers won't protect themselves. They think it is okay to get catch up in the heat of the moment and not protect themselves. That's not reality.
Computers in can now also be used as great teaching instruments from everything from Biology to understanding of the cosm graph in Mathematics. They have enabled to student to learn in more ways than were previosly used,
and for some students they have been an incredible useful tool in learning.
The media is always trying to persuade us that their programs and ads are realistic, if so, show some programs and ads, that don't center around sex. I understand that “sex sells", but why can't we have more decent ads and programs, without sex. The media leaves nothing to the imagination. We have to assume nothing, all we have to did is look and listen. There was once a time when things were never shown or told, they were assumed. Its funny how some people say that sex should be talked about openly. Then when it comes down to talk about taking precautions and protecting themselves, nothing is said. You can't have one without the other. You can't want to discuss sex openly without discussing taking precautions measures.
When and if Susan Smith asks God for forgiveness, she will be forgiven. He will guide her and support her as she lives life day to day. He can make her scandalous life a testimony to help others headed in the same direction. Until she is willing to open up her heart to God she will be the same sick woman that she was when she drowned her two sons. If she opens up her heart to God then she will spend eternity in heaven. The Bible also states that <*>. Susan Smith is entitled to this opportunity just as as any other person on earth. She is faced with making the You choice of seeing sons again in heaven or receiving a punishment worse than the rest of her life into prision, and that is spending eternity in hell.
The extend to which computers can be used has just begun for really take hold, but they is clearly imp in many aspect of our lives. With the increasing technology who knows where these machines will take us.


, The national championship picture cleared up a little after the bowl games were played, but not too much. Notre Dame beat Texas A&M 24-21, Florida State beat I Nebraska 18-17, and West Virginia was blown out by Florida 41-7. Nebraska and West Virginia were eliminated from the national championship picture with their losses, but there other was still some argument over whether, Florida State or Notre Dame should have the title. Florida State won the title outright, but their was some controversy over how Florida State could won the national championship over Notre Dame when both teams had one loss and Notre Dame beat Florida State during the regular season.

You can't wonder why many teenagers are sexually active without watching television or listening to a radios or Reading a magazine.
What do Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Naomi Cambell, and Kristy Turlington have in common? All of these women are extremely beautiful, all man are top notch models, but most importantly all are understood to be the "perfect and ideal" women. The 1990's base these standards or expectations on every woman, and every woman who doesn't resemble Barbie is perceived as imperfect.
You can't wonder why so many teenagers are getting pregnant and contracting sexually transmitted diseases, when there is so much information about safe sex. You can talk and advertise more about the precautions you take, if you want to become sexually active. You show more programs with less sex or "understood" sex. "Understood" sex is when they kiss and the lights go out until the next morning. With this in mind, maybe more teenagers will not want to 'd sex, because they want see how good it looks, everywhere they turn. The only things else that needs to be said is that sex is greatly overrated in the media.
Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly said, 11 How can you give the title to Notre Dame when they were whipped by Boston College and gave up 41 pts. in the process." 11 A team that can't whip a Southwest Conference team, Texas A&M, in a bowl can't be number 11(18). He also said that "Florida State can't have the title because they lost to Notre Dame in a game a which they were supposed to prove that they were the best team in the country , that they played liked chunky soup in their bowl game"(18). So in conclusion Rick Reilly said, 11 A squad that truly deserves to be etched in history likes the finest of 1993 .... Nobody"(19).

not An invention of the 20th century ) that I think has significantly changed people's lives is television. TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc. Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening. While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized. As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas. So, to example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.

The media plays a large feeling too part in the altering of a real woman's appearance. Society and media shouldn't persuade us as to what true beauty is. From the beginning of adolecense, girls is faced with implications from the news, television, and magazines to have the perfect body, skin, and hair. Because of the standards that society place on women, teenagers, and young girls, there are many disorders which alter these females' state of mind, health, and body. Disorders so severe that is such a strong dissatisfaction with one's appearance that they interfere with living healthy.

the national title. So who was true number 1 and true national champion in 1993-94 college football season, Florida State or Notre Dame. Again, the only way to answer this question fairly is to have a playoff system.
In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world make a "smaller", more unified place, or for a "global village" as one journalist has call this world of the Information Age.

	Not only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.  However, this sense of reality is not so distorted, and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman.  As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality, TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in.
When people sit down to watch a television program that has sex in it, they do not realize that somewhere a child could be watching that same program. The most common time for a child to watch a program that should be screened from them is when dad is at work and mom is in the kitchen cooking or cleaning. Children starting at age four, generally watch what looks interesting to them. Children like to watch what they call 11 Big people shows". Those kind of shows not only interest the children but make the children to want to experiment and do what the people on the shows do. Watching "Big people shows" makes the child feel older and grown up. Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch. If you spread that in a seven day period that's about two programs a day. Let us start when a child gets home from school at

Now the end of the 1994 college football season was absolutely ridiculous. I think that this season alone speaks enough to say that college football should have a playoff system. The Nebraska Cornhuskers, 13-0, won the national championship in the '94 season over the Penn State Nittany Lions who were 12-0. Now this situation doesn't make any kind of sense. Nebraska was playing Miami in the Orange Bowl and Penn State was playing Oregon in the Rose Bowl. Now if of these teams loses and the other wins, then there's really no dispute over who's the national champion. But if both teams win, you've got a psychology dilemma. There was no way that Nebraska and Penn State could have played each other because their conference wouldn't had allowed them to go to different bowl games. Nebraska is in the Big Eight Conference and Big Eight champion has to go to the Orange Bowl. Penn State was in the Big Ten Conference and the Big Ten champion has to go the Rose Bowl.
Of course this problem was not the model's fault, they are doing there job of being beautiful. But media places such a strain on being the "perfect" women. The average modeling is 5'9" tall, weighs 1 10 pounds, and her measurements are 34-24-34. Only one percent of all women ages eighteen to seventy fit into this category. The average women is 5'4" tall, weighs 145 pounds, and her measurements are 36-28-38. If we took Barbie and made her into a real woman, she would be 5'10" tall, would weigh 105 pounds, her measurements would be 34-22-34, and would fit into a perfect size 1.

out three o'clock. On one channel at three o'clock a soap opera is on which has sex, violence, and profanity. In four o'clock Opra talk show is on which has sex and profanity usually. At five o'clock Ricki Lake talk show is on which has sex and profanity. After her show we have the News a game show and then a nigh time soap opera. By this time it's nine o'clock and time for the child to go to bed and out of six hours there was one thirty minute game show that is fit for a child to watch. With these television programs on every day the child starts to watch his or her favorite show and once interested then wants to experiment. Children from ages four to twelve have not been educated about sexuality to understand what they are watching on television. Children see people on television as role models and want to be like them, dress like them, and copy what they do. The child's mind and body have not yet matured and developed for them to experiment what they see on television. For an example, if an eight year old is watching the Ricki Lake show who has unmarried thirteen and fourteen year old girls that been pregnant, child might think when she turns thirteen that she might get pregnant or that it's okay. Also, the child is not knowledgeable enough to know how the thirteen year old got pregnant. Once the child starts putting the television programs together they will soon learn how the teenager got pregnant and the child will think it's all right to have sex and get pregnant at an early age.
I better that every woman may not look at the famous models and want to resemble them, but I admit that I the opposite -- I only wish that I could be as flawless as Cindy Crawford. But it is ridiculous to try to fit myself into her measurements, and weight. And yet women everywhere include themselves in disorders such as Anorexia and Bulimia, and use severe measure of beautification processes to try (most times with failure) to enhance their own image.
Both teams won their bowl games on. Nebraska struggled was get past Miami 24-17 while Penn State whipped up on Oregon 38-20. However, Nebraska still won the title outright due to the fact that they played a higher ranked team in a bowl. Miami was ranked number 3 and Oregon was ranked number 11. But how can you justify giving the national championships to one team when there
Children are not educated enough below the age of twelve to experiment everything they see on television. The variety of television programs that children have to choose from is not large at all. But yet children have more time and use their time to watch television more than adults do. There are even some cartoon programs that are on early in the morning and early in the evening that are suitable for children,to watch. The parents do not pay attention to the cartoon programs to see what the content is. They just assume that because it is a cartoon that it is suitable for their child to watch. I do not allow my four year old and eight year old to watch 11 The Simpsons", because along with profanity Bart Simpson is disrespectful and yet children think is so great and so funny. The children that see Bart Simpson as a role model will tend to copy his tactics and think that it is all right to talk backs to your parents and be disrespectful when it is not.
Children are not mentally ready to cope with the sex, violence, and profanity that is on television all day and everyday.  Children draw their own conclusions from what they see big people or adults do.  Only adults do not usually show sexual relations, violence and profanity in front of their children.  Instead the television bluntly shows them.  My four year old draws her own conclusion sometimes.  Just recently she saw a man and a women kiss on television and. assumed that they were married.  When I told her they were not married, she insisted that when a man and women kiss that they are married.  Every child is different and draws their own conclusions.  The majority of the movies that are on television also have nudity in them and once the child's curiosity is motivated the questions start popping up for mom and dad to answer.  That's not always a problem if the child is old enough to know and understand what you are going to explain to them, but if the child is too young and not educated enough and you just don't answer him then he will take his curiosity some where else and that could be harmful for the child.
With Anorexia, ninety-five percent of all cased are women, and one woman out of every one hundred is an anorexic. They are obsessed with food, their body, and with being unrealistically thin. Above all of this though, is that there is no cure. Bulimia includes binging and purging large quantities of food. Five to twenty percent of all college women suffer from Bulimia, and inhibit symptoms of erosion of mouth, bones, and tooth enwnel. Plastic surgery on an increase these days, it seems that everywhere you look, girls as young as fourteen are having breast implants, or facial operations, what they don't realize though, is that implants or tucks don't last forever, and are a leading cause of Cancer. Liposuction is used to remove fat, but is a very dangerous procedure that could lead to bleeding to death, at the slightest mistake made by a surgeon. Bogus beauty products are used by women as well, chemicals that break down skin, and bone are used on the body. There are many girls and women that must wear dentures because the methods in which they used to whiten their teeth only ruined them. Why? Why should we put ourselves through this? Should we let society develop what our image of what beauty is? Because of all of the pressures to be beautiful that are placed on women, we are only making ourselves unhealthy, and in the long run fatally ill.

Sexuality is a large area to cover. Not only does it include just plain sex but how about homosexuality? Yes, homosexuality is on television also. How is a parent suppose to explain that to a four year old where she can understand it? I am not sure, because the child again is not mentally educated enough to understand what the parent explains to them. Sexuality is not taught in school until eighth grade. Until then its up to the parents and the child's surroundings to keep the child from being harmfully educated by the television. It's hard to tell your child you just don't want him or her watching television but when the majority of the programs are for adults only that what can you say but no. I know the televisions stations cannot completely stop the adult programs until children are in the bed but maybe if they viewed more programs for children between the hours after school and about eight o'clock at night the the children would not be exposed to sexuality as much as they are now. Even if the programs are only thirty minute programs the child would look forward to watching it every day and this would not be harmful for the child. I feel that in the last five years the media has really gotten bad in showing sex, violence, and profanity on television, even in the commercials, but I feel that if adults want to see the the sex,, violence, and profanity they can go to a movie theatre or rent a movie. As it stands now about ninety percent of the rated "RI, movies you would go to a theatre and see you can watch your very own television right now. I think the media should give a little more thought to our children growing up in the nineties and a little less thought to the very busy adults that watch a lot less television than children do.
are two teams that are unbeaten. Penn State did used best college football team could do and that's win all of your games. And not only did Penn State beat all of their opponents, is but they destroyed most of them. No one really came close to beating Penn State during the regular season.
Television and magazine ads display the beauty products or diets in a manner in which we women think that we need them. I mean if the model in the commercial can look like that because she uses that certain product -- so can I (yeah right.) I believe that females are given a false sense of hope or expectation, because I know that how ever much makeup I put on, I will never look like Christie Brinkley -- my body was just not made that way! It angers and discourages me to think that young and it women are being used as ploys for the beauty industry to make money off of our insecurities. They know that we think our hips are too big, so they come out with a fantastic machine that does nothing for the betterment of the body, only a decrease of money in our wallets.


It is prevalent that guns are be misused daily. This leads to all types of situations such as youths being able to get access to guns commit murders, people killing others over nonsense, and several other related issues.

But just like every other college football team in the nation, Penn State no control over who they play in bowl game. Nebraska just happen to get the better luck of the draw by having to play a higher ranked team in a bowl game. This be unfair and unjustly to Penn State to not at least have a share of the national championship for all of their hard work and great accomplishments. They did the best they could do and still was were robbed.
Women everywhere, of all sizes face the influences of the media and from society to be perfect. It has been proven that obese women are less likely to be married. though they may be as qualified as any other woman, they earn 6,000 dollars less every year. They are ten percent more likely to live in poverty and experience job discrimination due to their size. Most obese women have a low self esteem and low level of their self image. Typically larger women 's stereotyped as lazy, stupid, and that they contain no self control.

Penn State's Joe Paterno said, "I always wanted a playoff system- that's nothing new to me(C6).

misused: "Toby R. Sincino, the 15-year-old who shot two teachers at Blackville-Hilda High School before killing himself, was buried Tuesday--the same day one of his victims was released from the hospital (The Times and Democrat,pg.6A)." This incident that occurred at the Blackville-Hilda High School where a student shots two teachers and himself is good example of how young kids can get a gun, the same as Toby did, and create trouble for themselves and others. This incident should also serve as a lesson to schools of levels to keep gun control at a maximum to reduce in-school killings of techers, students, and other faculty memebers.
Again, if there was a college playoff system, there wouldn't have been any argument over who was the real national champion in the '94 college football season, Nebraska or Penn State.

The bowl games pay outs a good amount of money to the colleges that attend their bowls, but a playoff system would generate more revenue because there would be more games played and the fan excitement would be unbelievable.

inner beauty. Once we realize that beauty isn't everything, we can begin to live healthy, both mentally and physically. Girls, teenagers, and women everywhere must realize that you must respect yourself before anyone else can respect you, but beauty is something that comes from inside, and shines through onto the outside. Any wealthy women could go to a plastic surgeon, and explain what she want to look like, but we all can understand and be truly happy with ourselves. I am not condemning self improvement, but do we have to go to such extreme measures, just to please perceived idea of beauty? Do we have to go through the torment, and put our bodies through such terrible things? What about our states of mind -- these drastic actions can only be detrimental to the ways in which we think. I think not. We don't have to let society coerce their opinions of beauty onto us, we don't have to let the media make us believe that we're not good enough, or pretty enough. We all just need to understand that every one of qualities that make us beautiful, and neither the media or society have anything to do with that.

College football should have a 16 team playoff system at the end of the regular season and use their bowl games for neutral sites.  College football should take the top 16 teams in the country, pair them up into two brackets, and let them play it out.  The reason it should be only 16 teams is so that the playoffs won't last so long and 16 is a fair number to have when selecting teams.  The bowl games should be the neutral sites so that the bowls will still have their games and so that no one plays on their home field.  The playoff system will last four weeks because each week a different set of games will be played and on the fourth week, there would be two teams left.  The other teams that do not qualify for the playoff system can go to a regular bowl game.  These bowl games would be played on other days from the playoff games so that they can be shown on

Two of college football's premier coaches, Florida's Steve Spurrier and Florida State's Bobby Bowden, were asked about a playoff system during a college football halftime show on ABC. Florida's Steve Spurrier said that he always been in favor of a playoff system. Florida State's Bobby Bowden said that he was in favor to a playoff system, but seemed a little more reluctant because he felt that the college football season too long and a playoff system would make the season even longer.
commit a robbery. However, if there were more stringent could gun control laws in effect, these perpetrators would think twice before committing such crimes. One citizen said she wants “more police protection, especially the daytime (Times and Democrat,page 1A). Another citizen said small-town banks 'need more security (Times and Democrat,page 1A)." The gun control in Branchville will soon be out of control if citizens' concerns are donot taken into consideration.
For several years now there has been an ongoing war against all the has not benefited the United States at all. Americans likes a whole have shown that they feel that keeping drugs illegal helps to keep them under control. As drug problems get worse though, a small minority of people have begun to realize the effects drug laws are having on the society of America. They have come to reality and decided that ,drug prohibition has not worked in the past, does not now, and will not work in the future (Duke 231). Drug legalization , has many beneficial outcomes and personally I think it' s time we stop wasting money keeping drugs illegal when it does not even work. America needs to use that money on more important things such as helping the homeless or promoting education.
Some people think that action needs to be taken on drugs. Most published worked are about decreasing the drug use. Drugs are here to stay whether anyone likes it or not. would be nearly impossible to completely eliminate all of the different drug uses. People will find some kind of over-the-counter drug or inhalants, to get high was off of. The legalization of some drugs like marijuana would improve many different aspects of society.

Health problems seem to be a concern as far as legalization goes. Issues such as permanent damage to the brain and other parts of the anatomy. The fact is that people are going to use drugs anyway, so why place not regulate the pureness of some of these drugs. A majority of drugs relate to or have deadly effects. Most people do not see marijuana as a drug. They view it like cigarettes. Marijuana is probably one the of the lease harmful of drugs. The side effects of marijuana is not apparent as some other drugs. I do not feel as strongly about legalizing crack cocaine as others. are some other things legal today, which can have potentially deadly results. Lung cancer from cigarette smoke, liver failure from the abuse of alcohol, and the potential loss of teeth and gum damage from chewing tobacco.
The reason a around lot of person are against a playoff system is because they don't want to see the bowls go and they think that the season will be too long. The bowls have been associated with at college football so long that it might not seem right without the bowl games. Some people also think that college football would lose more money hangout a playoff system because you won't have the bowls there to pay the schools.

But which ever way look at it, college football need a playoff system because the debate over who's number and who's the national champion is getting ridiculous and out of control.

Not only would drug legalization benefit the world in those ways but it would also make more room for the real criminals in prison rather than the drug users.

Another incident took place in my hometown , involving the misue from guns was the killing of my Uncle Edward. Here is the story so told by my mother, when giving her account on the misuse of guns:
My brother, Edward C. Spigner, came upon his death within the 's use of a handgun.
Alcoholism is a growing problem in the United States that affects all ages. Too many students fight alcoholism in high school and college environment. This problem could freely be curtailed by lowering the drinking age from twenty-one eighteen. Changing the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would lower the amount of crimes among young adults, encourage a more responsible approach to alcohol in the United States and improve the health of the nation. Allowing alcohol consumption at age eighteen would change the way America viewed alcohol-use as a society. Lowering the drinking age would gradually change society, and encourage a more mature managements of alcohol.
The next benefit would has to be the fact that the drug users would be responsible for their own debts. <*> . If drugs were legal America would not be wasting money on keeping them illegal. Also, if all drugs were taxed it would be beneficiary me to America because we could that money onto more important things.
The first claim of supporters is that they are under the opinion that it is much more expensive to keep a convicted criminal in prison for life than to simply pull their plug. At first glance this statement seems to be more than rational. The problem here is that people don't realize the big picture of the situation at hand. Instead of capital punishment saving tax payers money, it actually does the complete opposite. Let me throw a couple of statistics at you that I gathered doing a paper last year. Currently to administer capital punishment upon a single individ ual it costs five times to the amount than it to inprison somebody from the age of eighteen to eighty years old. How this statement can be valid is due to the reasons that when someone recieves the death penalty they are not killed the next day. Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years. During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals. These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs. When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system. This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system. So if the cost of punishment is at all a concern for you, then it is obvious that capital punishment is the wrong
Lowering the drinking age would decrease the amount of crime among youths. has youths break the laws every time they attempt to buy or consume alcohol. Lowering the drinking age would allow youths to buy alcohol and not break the law doing it. on most college campuses, alcohol is involved in most violent behavior or crimes (Rick Finley@rfinleygmail.vt.edu). Lowering the drinking age would allow college campuses to spend more time reviewing education instead of drinking policies. Today, many colleges are experiencing major problems with underage drinking. Many colleges are struggling with enforcing these policies (WWW.mis.duke.edu/Task-forces/Alcohol/Alcohol-chart.html).

as he turned to leave, the acquaintace pulling out a handgun and started shooting and at least three of the shots hitting my brother. He was taken to the hospital, but dying approximately an hour later.(Interview With Mom)
Another important benefit of legalizing drugs would be that it would help to enhance public health. The dangers to physical health from using drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, marijuana or other previously illegal drugs, would be greatly reduced. If drugs were to increase by factor of two or three, the deaths and diseases caused by such drug use would be much lower than they are now. Legalizing heroin, cocaine, and marijuana would produce a reduction in the use of tobacco and alcohol, saving thousands of lives every year, maybe even more. Many of there illegal drugs are substitutes for alcohol, and vice versa. This suggests that increased availability of marijuana would reduce alcohol consumption. Similarly, when heroin, they become alcohol abusers. Making heroin more available would probably decrease the number of alcohol abusers. If legalization produces an increase in the consumption of illegal drugs, some of the increase may represent a transfer from alcohol or even tobacco. But even if no such transfers happen, the first factor mention above might produce a reduction in smoking and drinking.
direction a , go.


This crime was an act of nonsense. When my uncle walked away after words were exchanged, the acquaintance could have done the same to problems the confusion between the two of them. Instead of taking the easy and safe way out, the acquaintance brought sorrow to my family. This is a good example of why we need increased gun control. If people with guns would use their heads instead of the trigger, these situations would not occur.
Lowering these drinking age would allow colleges to spend more time reforming education programs and aiding students. A high amount of underage drinking occurs in the school and college environments (US Department of Health and Human Services). Allowing alcohol consumption at age eighteen would cut back on reform programs because less people would need these programs. Most candidates for reform programs are under the national drinking age (US Department of Justice 3-62). Eighteen- year old Is would not feel a need to strike at society for - "lost rights." Adolescents are in an awkward place in society, being between childhood and adulthood (Newman 506). Allowing eighteen-year olds to drink would include eighteen-year olds in society and make them less likely to cause crimes as a way of expressing their anger. Many young adults that drink, drink uncontrollably and in large environments (Newman 506). Giving youths back their privileges of drinking will allow them to fit in and feel included in society.
Another good factor of drug again legalization is that drug prosecution will no longer destroy the lives of otherwise productive citizens. Most users of presently illegal drugs, like tobacco and alcohol users, usually show respect for the law. But makes their drug consumption a serious crimes makes it harder for them to purchase the drug. It also makes it impossible for them because of their socially and economically margin. Many of the people in jail are there for illegal drug drug-related offenses. If drug prohibition was repealed, many of these people would be useful members of society. For example, men or women who are in jail for drug offenses and have a family at home, would be able to help raise their families left parentless by imprisonmemt.
Another reason offered by advocates is the feeling that retribution is necessary for those who commit these particular crimes. The fault here is that they are trying to use the judicial system as a tool for revenge instead of it's intended purpose which is to deliver punishments to those violating the law. There is a large difference between revenge and punishment. Correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the direct impression that mankind tried the the eye for an eye approach for awhile but it wasn't el,,,actly humane so we gave it up. So why do some members of society feel that this midevil philosophy for punishment should still exist in the medium of capital punishment. Doesn't it seem a bit hypocritical to exclaim that killing another human is wrong, so therefore for a punishment society is turning around and killing the offender for doing the exact same thing that it is supposedly create justice. I think societies should realize that this form of punishment is being applied to those for doing exactly what the punishment is doing to them, which totally contradicts the morals involved(respect for human life). How are individuals in society supposed to respect life when the system that governs them refuses to.
Lowering the drinking age would encourage a responsible approach to alcohol in the United States. Giving back drinking rights to eighteen-year old's would make them realize their privileges. Irresponsibility in drinking and driving caused the implementation of National Minimum Drinking Act (Netscape.Young Drinkers Homepage 2). Eighteen-year old's did not act responsibly when they had the right to drink. When Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Act in 1984, all eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-year old's lost their right to consume and purchase alcohol. Eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-year old's have had their rights restricted for eleven years. Once these rights are given back, young adults will act responsibly. In high school and college environments, most teens are drawn to the drinking scene because it is new and glamorous. Allowing consumption at age eighteen will change the way young adults view the drinking scene. The whole idea of drinking will not seem as glamorous if young adults have been drinking at age eighteen. Most young adults in college are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. Drinking will be normal and ordinary to eighteen- year old's, and not a new and fun environment. Lowering the drinking age would decrease the amount of underage drinking among college students. Today, eighteen-year old's are responsible enough please enter into contracts, be sued, can be drafted into the military, and die for their country (nttp.www.kfu.com/nsayer). If eighteen-year old's can be drafted and assigned adult roles in the United States, then they should be allowed to enjoy all adult privileges.
With all of The gun-related crimes, "gun control has continued to be widely debated and often opposed, notably by the National Rifle Association (Multimedia Resoureces-CDRom)." This opposing organization doesn't realize that gun-related crimes are steadily rising. Statistics recently state that out all the "hate crimes committed in the United States, robbery and murder are amongst the highest with robbery being approximately 2.5% of of the 4,755 crimes reported and murder being approximately 16.3% of the 4,755 crimes reported (Multimedia Resources-CD-Rom)."
I have presented some of the most important benefits of drug legalization. we think it is about time my America to face the truth and to stop the war against drugs we use legal drugs to our advantage. Eventually something
In closing, if I could make the laws for gun control, I would make it where no one but the policemen and people in the military would be allowed to carry guns. Besides, they are people who know when and where to use a gun. In the United States the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Constitution, but has been variously interpreted, especially for the wrong reasons. 'Because of the various interpretations, major controversy over gun control and the growing number of gun-related crimes, a congressional passage of the Brady Bill was propelled in 1993. This bill requiring a five-day waiting period and background check before a handgun purchase (Multimedia Resources-CD-Rom).
A lower drinking age would improve the health of the nation. Binge drinking is a common problem among high school and college students (US Department of Health and Human Services 2). A study taken by the Public there Health Service showed that 40% of college students engage in binge drinking regularly. When most students drink, they are in environments where alcohol is the reason for the gathering or party. Alcohol is a scarce object for young adults between ages eighteen and twenty. Most students binge drink when they drink because it is hard to acquire alcohol.
The final reason that I'm going to refute is that capital punishment is a better deterent for future criminals. They are under the false assumption that many more people would commit more murdeers with only the threat of life imprisonment, than if the death penalty was implemented. This may seem plausible, but under close scrutiny it ends up being completely false. They have done studies in statels where the time death penalty has been employed. They measured the murder rate before and after capital punishment went into effect. They expected to find a scare decrease in the murder rate, but instead found no change at all. There are a couple of reason's this has no effects on the murder rate. The main reason would be that the people committing these murders don't plan on getting caught, so they are not even contemplating the punishments of their actions. Still another reason is that when people kill each other most of the time they aren't sitting around drawing up prols and con's for murdeer raps, so the death penalty has no effect on whether or not to commit the crime. It seems very obvious to myself that murders don't consider the form proposal punishment when killing another human being, so deference couldn't increase with
Lowering the drinking age would allow youth to acquire and decrease the amount of binge drinking.  Lowering the drinking age would decrease alcoholism in the United States in the long run.  Many Americans see drinking as a pastime, and as the center of social life.  Alcohol is the "forbidden fruit" among teens.  Many teens drink to feel rebellious and to do something cool.  Alcohol is an addictive drug in today's society.  Alcoholism is a problem today because of the way Americans view drinking.  Lowering the drinking age would allow eighteen-year old's access to alcohol, and not break the law to obtain it.  Alcoholism is not a problem in other countries because of the alcohol is viewed in their societies.  In Canada, alcohol is served with meals, regardless of a person's age (Rick Finley@rfinley@mail.vt.edu). Alcoholism is controlled because there is a mature approach to drinking.  In other countries, alcohol is a beverage served at the party, not the reason for the party.  Lowering the drinking age would allow society to get a grip on alcohol.  The effects of lowering the drinking age would not be seen in America immediately.  Allowing consumption of alcohol at age eighteen would drastically change the way Americans felt about drinking.

the death penalty into he effect.

the above situation are all the reasons why obtaining guns should wonder had tougher.
Lowering drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would effect the United States in a number of ways. Alcoholism is a problem today because for the way it is viewed in America's society. Lowering the drinking age would decrease the amount of crime among young adults because many would not break a law trying to obtain alcohol. Responsible drank would be encourage by lowering the drinking law. Young adults would drink responsibly and safely if the drinking age were to be lowered. The overall health of Americans who drink would improve if the drinking age was lowered. The common problem of binge drinking would be cured if the drinking age were lowered. Lowering the drinking age would impact the country in a number of ways, and change the way society viewed alcohol. Changing the drinking age would overall increase responsibility amoung young adults, which would greatly affect the nation in the long run.

In conclusion, I feel I have given significant reasons and statistics to revoke the main arguments for the support from capital punishment. I have shown that financially this practice is only detramental to the wallets of the tax payers. The reasoning behind this punishment is full of holes which implies that justice and capital punishment can't coexist. It has also been proven that capital punishment won't deter people from taking lives in the future. With no reasons left to rationalize capital punishment, it seems there is no use for it in our present day.

Sometimes when people suffer from extreme illnesses they look for other options as an easy way out. When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and they choose a form of suicide which is referred for as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a "mercy killing" for the purpose of putted an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?



This topic came to me on Friday night when "The State" called to solicit a subscription to their newspaper. I refused to take a subscription to their paper. Several years ago I considered myself . to be an avid reader. However lately, I feel the quality of their news has begun to go down. I remember last year when I was- interviewed by a representative of "The State", on the patio of the Russell House. I told them at that time that they had lost the qualities of their news, and the price was just too high for what they had in their paper.

Over the passing years, I have come to know a "new media." It is no longer the media of my younger years. Then, newspapers, radio and television were successfiil without dragging up all kinds of dirt on any and every person or ivent that came along.
The wild card was was introduced to baseball for the first time this year. The introduction was made necessary by the realignment of the Eastern and Western divisions of the National and American Leagues into the Eastern, Central, and Western divisions. The realignment produces three Division winners, thus creating the need for a fourth team from each league up order to even up the playoff matches. The wild card, this fourth team, is decided by taking the team from each league with the best record the three Division winners. The wild card is good for baseball because it adds more teams . to the playoffs, creates another race similar to a pennant race, and provides more competition.
There are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to a as a "vegetable." When to a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of housekeeping patient's
With their racy topics and their spirited audeinces, daily talk shows had become a part of many television viewers lives. Many viewers, young and old tune in to watch guest panelist and audience members lash out angrily and agressively at one another. A percentage of people feel this type of programming, labeled trash t.v.. is vulgar. and inappropriate for television and should be pulled from the airwaves. Many faithful viewers. feel these talk shows are harmless or entertaining. These differences in opinions leads to numerous questions concerning the purpose and benefits, if any, of these talk shows.
recovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the is doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunities to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistaken on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes. A third type of euthanasia is self-inflicted by one's ending of one's life by means of suicide. This type of euthanasia is occurring more frequently because it is seen as the easiest way out.
I guess my realization of this "right to know" came when United States troops were sent into Grenada in the 1980's. The media's "right to know' was unknowingly broadcasting troop movements to the enemy, endangering the fives of our young people. As a parent of it of these young people, I was appalled and infuriated. How dare they endanger lives with their "right to know". It happened again in Desert Storm and Bosnia. What happen to waiting for the battle to end before the cameras and lights went on? I suppose this might come under the people's 'right to know", however, I were sure they would hope that the the sons and daughters they sent to fight, would at least have a small chance of surviving the first impact before someone told the enemy where they were. Watch out, future warriors of this country. It may be your turn to step up in front of a camera when you least expect it.
In the past, there were only four teams involved in the playoffs which consisted of only two rounds. Round one, in the old playoff system was known as the League Championship Series where the winner of the National League East played the winner of the National League West and the winner of the American League East played the winner of the American League West. The World Series was the second round and featured the winner of the National Leagued Championship Series versus an winner of the American League Championship Series. The playoff systems includes eight teams and three rounds.
In the early 1990's, the United States was looking for new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders. The media took a perfectly good candidate, probably would have made an excellent Surgeon General, and dug up as much dirt on him as possible. They found he had performed four abortions and despite the other good things this person may have done in his life, he was rejected on this reason. Was this a rejection or a crucifixion?
In the new system, the first round is called the Division Series and includes eight teams. Major League Baseball has set upping the following rules to determine who plays who in the Division
"The Spectator" taking it upon themselves recently to malign a member of the University about South Carolina English Department. They could have had no reason but to cast themselves in the limelight, because the article was in no way newsworthy. They had no compunction about their action and probably said, "Let's just smear him because he is different and does not conform to the mold of 'everybody else."' Perhaps, if everybody were alike, there would be no "news". However, this country were founded on the differences in people, and that were what makes this country great.
Many people feel that talk shows, trashy or not. are for entertainment purposes only and should not be downplayed because of their candid themes. The host of the show allows the public to dispute and air thier grievances. find help and solutions to their problems, and share positive and negative feedback says many issues affecting the worldly today Many of these programs provide their viewers with helpful information about heath, financial matters. family counseling. and social issues that they may not Have been aware of before.

William F. May wrote in his essay, The Right to Die and the Obligation to Care: Allowing to Die, Killing Mercy, and Suicide that there are four major cultural and social forces opposed to right to die. The first force is has view among Christains that suicide is <*>. The second force states that self-destruction is not only immoral, unnatural, and sinful, but illegal. A third social force pushing against the right to die is the spectacular success of modern technology. The advancing of technology has led to many break throughs medicine. Illnesses that were once thought fatal are being cured. The fourth societal force is the medical profession.

Series:

At the end of the regular season, the three Division champions and the team with the best second-place record in each League (the wild card team) will advance to the best-of-five Division Series.  The wild card team will then play the division winner with the highest winning percentage, unless that division winner is from the same division or does not have home field advantage in the Division Series. (Major League Baseball)
People are invited to write or call in to the shows to discuss their personal lives with millions of viewers. topics discussed on these shows consist of sibling rivalries, family fueding, and disagreements between friends, neighbors. and lovers. The idea of each show is to build up the topic to a level where tempers may flare turns of control and increasing the audiences' interest in the topic, making the discussions hotter. The host dies deep into the minds of the guests to bring out deep, dark secrets about each of the guest. With the host searching for hidden secrets. the tension between the guests grows. This may lead to arguments and fights among the guests. audience members. and even the host! Members of the studio audience cheer on these actions making the discussion much greater than it started out to be. This type of action is what keeps millions of viewers on the edge of their seats day in and day out. tuning in for another exciting episode. But there is a flip side to talk shows. There are moments when flying fist and profane language turn into tears of joy or sadness. and compassionate hugs. These guest appear on the show to mend differences between each other. find solitude in what one may see as a dead end situation. or to give hope to those looking for something better and brighter than the dark skeletons taking over their daily lives. Many times these shows are overshadowed and

During the 0. J. Simpson trial, the media hoopla was like a circus that had come to the nation as a whole. The media surmised guilt or innocence, before the trial began who or the first evidence was presented. With each witness and fact, they were merciless in digging into the was backgrounds of each. It seems to me, this was the job of the prosecution and defense lawyers, not the media. Nobody was inunune to these incessant facts, They found something on everybody, including the witnesses, the prosecution and defense lawyers, and even the dismissed jurors. How did they know what the jurors were do and where they were sitting in the restaurants? Were they summarizing the plots and subplots and then projecting its onto the courts? It was all to sell more newspapers and more air time. There seemed to be very little about justice in this circus, and a lot about making money.
Now, the question is, who have fielded advantage?
May's four forces give us much insight into modern societies outlook on euthanasia which is an issue that has been debated for a long time. These forces have led to no concrete laws thus far. The main type of euthanasia being debated at the moment is physician assisted suicide. Physicians are helping patients end their own life by using their medical knowledge. The most publicized case in the United States is the case of Jack Kevorkian. Dr. Kevorkian developed a device in October 1989 that would end one's life quickly and painlessly. He assisted a 54 year old Alzheimer's disease patient in committing suicide in June 1990. In December, Kevorkian was charged with first-degree murder, and his charge was dismissed due to the fact that Michigan has no law against assisted suicide. Even though charge was dropped, No was ordered not to help anyone else commit suicide or to give advice about it. However, in February 1991, he violated the court order by giving advice about the preparation of the drug he invented to a terminally

Perhaps the media is the reason Colin Powell will not running for President. He would certainly be a very viable candidate, and would make a terrific President, as most military leaders have been in the past. But, why should he have to go through ad that media hoopla, just to be President of a country that would not appreciate his qualifications anyway? 1, for one, do not blame him. Who would want every little thing in their background brought up for public scrutiny? Just because a person has made a mistake in their past lives does not mean they will make that mistake in the future. The past is past. Let it be. Nobody is perfect. Perhaps, we should have the same qualifications for background checks into the lives of all these media people who are so quick to point be their fingers and ridicule others.
ill cancer patient. He still did not obey the court order and still instructed two Michigan women how to commit suicide. Finally, in October 1991, additional murder charges were lodged against him, but in July 1992 the charges dismissed once again Judge David Breck. David Breck stated that <*>. He also expressed his belief that physician-assisted suicide remains an alternative for patients experiencing Re unmanageable pain. This view has struck the heart of the medical community.

The answer is not that simple. Traditionally, in most playoff systems, the team with the better record receives home field advantage. Baseball, unfortunately, feels the need to be different and has been since the inception of the designated hitter. Home field advantage, in the previous playoff system, simply alternated between the two divisions in the League Championship Series and between the two leagues in the World Series. "In the newly created 'Division Series' playoffs, home field advantage be awarded to two division winners on a rotational basis" (The Wildcard... ). The two winners of the divisions series in each league then meet second round action.
All physicians are bound by the Hippocratic Oath. Each physician must pledge to adhere to the Hippocratic oath while performing their duties as a physician to society. While taking Hippocratic Oath, every physician must state this: <*>. These words of the oath are altered by many people when contradicting the right to death by choice. Physicians use this statement from the oath liked an argument against death choice.

When does the media's "right to know" start to tread for a person's right to privacy? Why do have to know and report when a ever gets up in the morning, or when that person goes to bed at night? Why do they have to know and report how many hwnburgers a person eats in a day, or how far they run to work it ofv. The bottoms line is, the reason for these things is a personal preference and none of the medi&s business. It is a wonder that we are not getting a play by play description of Reagan's Alzheimer's or Ford's golf gwne.
the second round of the playoffs is the League Championship Series. The winners of the National League Championship Series and the American League Championship Series then go on to meet in the third and final round, otherwise known as the World Series. The only question left is, way is all of this good for baseball?

If this madness of the media persists, I feel the next step will be to tap people's telephones and install cameras and microphones in each home. Then they can really tell what's going on. To go a step further, the media's freedom of speech will be the downfall of personal liberty in this country. I would hate to see it come to this, but ultimately, someone will have to be a responsible journalist and say I cannot report this foolishness. Hopefully, there are a few people outs there who still have integrity. Unfortunately, I have not seen anyone lately who would put their integrity on the line in lieu of money. I would like to say to the editors and publishers of today and to the newscasters, please get off this merry-go-round that you are on. Put the quality of the news before the dollar signs. Then perhaps you have people wanting read your papers and listen to your newscasts again.
There are now made teams in the playoffs thanks to the wild card. Baseball benefit from having more teams in the playoffs because it showcases more of its premier players. The

Doctors do not have the authority morally or ethically
Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, and New York Yankees all would not have been in the playoffs this year, if baseball did not realign the divisions and add the wild card. The absence of these four teams would have meant the absence of some of baseball's brightest stars. The Most Valuable Player from each league, Barry Larkin from the National League Cincinnati Reds and Mo Vaughn of the American League Boston Red Sox, would not have been involved in post season play. Ron Gant, Dante Bichette, Andres Galaragga, Larry Walker, Don Mattingly, David Cone, Ruben Sierra, Wade Boggs, Tim Wakefield, Jose Canseco, and Roger Clemens are other big name stars that would have been denied from the playoffs in the old system. The inclusion of of these additional stars in the playoffs is good for baseball because people are fascinated by star athletes as made evident by the use of star athletes in many popular advertising campaigns. More teams in the playoffs lets people watch more of their favorite players into postseason action, as well as involving more cities into the playoff excitement.

and according to the media. a neighbor wanted to reveal to his neighbor that he had a crush him. The catch is one guest has no idea who the crush is because it is a secret. With the unsuspecting neighbor having no idea the guy next door was about to reveal to him that he was his crush. he became angry and murder him. The show never air because of the tragic deadly ending.

The and wild card gets more cities involved in the playoff race because it allows an additional team from any division in league to participate in the playoffs. The race for get the wild card spot provides another race which is similar to a pennant race. More fans stay interested in baseball until the end of the season because they want to see who will receive the wild carding spot.

to make the decision to allow a patient to die. One's expertise as a physician does not give one the ability to decide the fate of the patient. A doctors be asked to administer an injection which would bring about an easy and painless death for a patient is terminally ill. In this case, he must be guided by his conscience. It is not the right of a doctor to decide to initiate or suggest euthanasia as an option, but it be one's option as a physician to cooperate with a patient's decision.

It is both the responsibility of the guest appearing on the show, and the host, to be aware of what may occur as a result of appearing on a talk show.

Whenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I expecially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be ture in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.
What is marijuana? It is a plant, and I think it should be legalized. The most political stance to take on this situation would be to say it's a drug and it should be thought of as an illegal substance. Although, that is the most political stance we all know me most politicians who set these laws up use drugs themselves. Over the last few years I've noticed a rise in the popularity of weed. My first time ever seeing weed was when I was a mouth kid. I didn't know exactly what it was, but I knew that it was a really odd smelling cigarette. When I got older I found out that my mom and my dad smoked weed when they were younger.
In our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follows the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook. This would mean more money or higher taxes. People are already paying taxes for public education, so why shouln't it benefit everyone not just the men in our community.
A friend of mine, senior in her last semester here at. USC, registered for a math class that she needed to fill a prerequisite for her major. She bought the book for the course and went to the first class. Her professor was a so native of another country and spoke very the little English. The professor could hardly speak English well enough to explain her syllabus. My friend thought, "Hey, math is a universal language. It s no big deal if the professor doesn't speak English as long as she knows her Calculus. This opinion would seem rational because mathematics concepts are performed the same in any language and hold the same logic in any tongue. A couple of classes later, when the course progressed to become more difficult with its introduction of new concepts, my friend began-to have difficulty with new material she hadn't covered in high school. Along with other students in her class, she began. To ask questions aloud during the class period. The professor couldn't answer a majority of the questions because she couldn't explain the procedures in English. The teacher knew what a denominator and a limit were, b t U she didn't understand how to say them in English and she didn't know what she was being asked of the students who-,@ spoke English. My friend arranged to meet with the professor during office hours to ask questions personally.

I always told myself that even though they did it back in the 70's it still wasn't right. I am a product of the just say no age. From way back when I was in the third grade the schools have been pounding it in my head "Just Say No". I never gave it any thought I figured the world was set up so that if you stayed off and away from drugs you 'd are live a better life. As I got older I realized that this was not true. The people that I know who sell marijuana had comfortable clothes and drove nice cars. The Columbian suppliers make millions every year. The American government officials who see and don't see make mega bucks, and most of these officials are the same guys who keep weed illegal.
The Citadel provides excellence discipline and education. Parents who have a son and a daughter should want them both to have these things. They should be able to receive , eqaul education. Every deserves a good education and upbringing. Men and woman do not need different levels of one or the other.
clinch wild carded berth.
During the appointment, the professor still couldn't communicate the correct working procedure for problems. Luckily, my friend still had time to drop the class. She called to register for another section of the same course and unluckily, all from the options were full and unavailable for take. She really needed the course for her major her only alternatives were to continue taking the course from the teacher who couldn't speak English or take the course in summer school. If she took summer school as an option, she wouldn't graduate on time.
As I got older and found out more about this mixed up world I came to realize that in european countries you can buy weed like you buy a pack of cigarettes. At first I thought this was extremely odd. In my mind weed was a drug I had seen it as a young kid but I had never actually inspected it. I didn't really know what marijuana was. Then one day I a conversation with this Jamaican man that we called Black Mosses. He explained it all to me, he told me that marijuana was natural because it was a plant that came from the earth and it could be used in it's leafy form unlike cocaine which was processed and it has impurities in it. He also said that the only reason that weed was illegal was because if it was legalized government officials wouldn't get their cut. When he was telling me this I thought that he was talking out of his head.
Students of the University of South Carolina, like students at colleges and universities across the nation, stumble upon a variety of difficulties in their classes frequently. Students confront problems with teacher-student relationships, grading scales, course difficulty, lack of preparation, and many others aspects of course work. One uncontrollable obstacle student at USC face, like my friend, is professors who don't speak English well enough to teach their pupils subject matter. The students have to drop the class, with possibly no alternative section to choose because they fill up so quickly at a large 1, university, or try to squander through complicated material alone. They feel it is clearly inhibiting and unjust, especially at a public college. I completely agree that before a professor should be allowed domain over a classroom at USC, he should be able to speak English well enough to teach his specific discipline to his students.
Do you ever notice that when the cops make a bust they arrest the more man, the neighborhood dealers. You rarely hear about people getting busted bringing drugs into this country. I'm not trying to say that it is some grand scale cover up by our government to bring more money into their economy, but think about it if marijuana was legalized the government wouldn't get its cut from the drug busts. I am in no way saying drugs are good, but I don't believe marijuana is a drug. I consider it to be an herb with helpful properties. Did you know that marijuana can be used to slow down certain eye ailments. Did you know that marijuana can be used as an ingredient in certain entrees. It is highly non habit forming, and their are nearly no long lasting side effects that occur from using this drug.
One reason that people don't want women to attend is they say it distract the men. I think this is not true, because many of the country's higher education institutions are coed. There is not a problem with it there. Men and women attend classes together and socialize together, but the two don't interfere. Sure, China may a few cases where that may happen, but that could happen anywhere. Men and women will not be and are not separated at the work place. Why should students at school be separated if they must deal with learening to work together with the opposite sex at the work place and everywhere else in life. By having the men separate you is teaching them that women are less superior. This kind of attitude could cause problems with other things later on in their life.

The task of professors is to teach and share their expertise with others. It are very beneficial to a student to have access to an authority on their subject matter. Students can learn new ideas and short cuts to solutions from their professors. Professors, giving trivial and specific information on a subject, sometimes like no teacher's aid can, will invoke the student to ponder-finer aspects of subject matter. The student can learn a wealth of information from an expert. The key is for the expert to be able to communicate his points clearly so that students grasp the knowledge-. Points must be made accessible to the students in order for communication between the students the professor to take place. A professor who speaks a different language other than his students can't teach them unless he has a sufficient amount of of knowledge of the students' language.
The wild card clearly provided extra excitement to the playoff picture because of the many different playoff possibilities it still presented on the last day of the season. The wild card and the realignment spread excitement out over five cities whereas the old alignment would have only brought excitement to Seattle and California. More cities being involved in the playoff picture led to more people being interested in baseball. Baseball really needed more fans who were interested in game because of the numerous fans who stopped followings baseball because of the strike of the previous season.
I personally have never used the drug, but I have a lot of friends who do and it only mellows them out when their stressed much like an advil would. If weed is so negative why are their so many former hustlers, current users, and former users in the media. These highly respected folks include the President of the U.S., The Notorious B.I.G. Snoop and this list could go on for days just naming rappers and rock stars. How could such a helpful herb get such a bad reputation. I'm not suggesting that any of my fellow class mates go out and start smoking weed but I have seen, personally, former class mates of mine light up before study c ession, and they have aced their tests the next day. In closing I happy like to quote big great Bob Marley a "Don't critisize it, legalize it.

The wild card provides more competition for the league championship for many reasons. The most obvious reason is that the wild card makes it necessary for a team to win two games in order to be the league champion instead of just one. The wild card teams were also very competitive this year. The wild card Colorado Rockies won one out of four games against the Atlanta Braves, while the Central Division Champion Cincinnati Reds lost all four games they played against the Braves. The Rockies also managed to score nineteen runs in those four games, while the Reds only got a total of five runs in their series with the Braves. In the American League, the wild card New York Yankees took the Western Division Champion Seattle Mariners to a final fifth game, which the Yankees lost in extra innings. The wild card teams were clearly very competitive in the playoffs which was good of baseball because it makes the World Series tougher to win.
The debates over whether or not Marijuana should be legalized has been around since the sixties, and people today are realizing that it is certainly an issue that will not go away. It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they to overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.

The first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal into 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the "higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increace appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that "marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man." More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.
Students come to schools with the hope of furthering their education so that they may one day practice a career in the field to their major. Students can read and study textbook theories and examples, but it helps them to have access to guides. These guides are their professors. They pay not only for books every semester, but for tuition. Tuition money is supposed to pay for the professors to teach the students. Students who pay for their tuition expect professors to teach them in return. When professors can't speak English, they can't communicate with English speaking students ; therefore they cannot teach them. Students need someone to guide them through wordy material in a book. Students need someone to lead labs and give them hands on experience. When the student is paying for his needs, for what reason should he n't have them fulfilled? When a person buys an item from a store, he pays and receives the item he paid for. When students pay tuition, they should also receive what they're paying for-a teacher who can teach them. Sometimes a teacher's assistant can substitute for a professor, and this is what should happen if a professor can't speak a language well enough to teach. This is one solution, but we are confronted with another problem. Even though teaching aides can help, students don't benefit from them as much as they do a professor. A professor has a Ph.D. and is a trained expert. Students need to be taught by professors when they are taking advanced courses that apply to their major field of study. A professor is an asset to upper class students finishing courses for their degrees-.
The next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the "high", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show sign of short term memory loss after smoking.
The wild card has many positive effects on baseball. Without the wild card, fans would have been unable to view some of the best and most popular players in the game in playoffs action. Without the wild card, the end of the season would have been very boring with two out of the four division winners basically decided with two months of the season left and three out of the four playoff spots filled by the last day of the who season. Without the wild card, the Mariners would not have beaten the Yankees in a dramatic final eleven inning game which reminded baseball fans why they loved the game. Without the wild card, the World Series would not have been as hard to win 's because there would have been no Division Series to have to survive in order to make it to League Championship Series. Perhaps most importantly, without the wild card, baseball would have remained behind football and basketball which have had more than two rounds of playoffs for years. When all is said and done, the wild card could be the factor that brings baseball back to the forefront after losing popularity to football and baseball.
If a husband is considerate enough to "allow" wife to stay home and take care of the household duties,his wife should literally worship the ground he walks upon. Not in this day and age. In a marriage in which the wife chooses to stay home while the husband takes care of all financial responsibilities, the wife should not be viewed as any less a person nor denied equal ownership of all possessions. The wife does make valuable contributions to the family that a price can not be put on. Another reason a stay home wife's position in the family should not be viewed as inferior to that of in the working husband is because when the marriage was entered into the man should have known her plans for their future together. If he didn't like the idea of his wife not working then perhaps the marriage should not have been entered into.

<ICLE-US-SCU-0013.3>
After the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. "There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug onto occasion", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano. Most agree, however as prolonged usage lead to some memory loss.
The Board of Trustees at USC should closely examine this problem. The university requires that teacher's assistants speak English well before they can teach. There is a rigorous program that applicants hoping to become teacher's assistants must pass. However, professors don't have to go through any program to prove that can speak an ample amount very of English to teach. Once some person has a Ph.D., he can apply to USC for a teaching position without having to prove he knows English well enough to teach English speaking students. The school board needs look
In some marriages due to the fact that the wife does not work, she is viewed as inferior to her husband, simply because the husband is the bread winner for the family. However, that doesn't give him the right to label all the items purchased as "his." I be watching a television program this issue appeared in the script. The husband was talking to one of his children while fixing on an automobile. The child asked <*>. The husband replied <*>. The child said <*>. The father added <*>. The wife over have heard this conversation and became quite upset. She had thought that their relationship was one based on the principle of fifty, fifty. However, her husband was labeling what she considered ',their', possessions as "his" possessions. The husband then went on to say that he viewed the car as his because he took care of it, She then took the argument in a different direction. She said that if that was the case then by right she owned the house because she cleaned it and kept it up. He then struck back by saying that the house was also his because oddly enough he paid for it too. This is where the line should be drawn. It's impossible to have a healthy marriages if each partner puts labels of ownership on his or her possessions. The wife in this situation is made to feel inferior, however, she shouldn't.

When a reporter interviews someone for a story that will be published, whether it be in a newspaper, on a TV broadcast, or on the radio, the interviewee has but to trust the reporter to be fair and honest. The interviewee must believe that the reporter will report the facts accurately, or the interviewee will not tell the whole story. If the interviewee does not want the public to know where the reporter got the story, the reporter must decide if he/she will keep the source secret. If the reporter decides to keep the source secret, he/she must do so, no mattered who asks for the information.
Without encouraging use of Marijuana, any doctor will inform you that Alcohol has proven time and time again to be more detrimental to the mind and body than Marijuana. More than 150,000 Americans die about alcohol abuse each year, more than 400,000 die from diseases reacted to smoking cigarettes. But ever it has been cultivated in China, back 4000 BC, NO ONE has ever died from marijuana.
Keeping the sources secret, especially in a courtroom setting has always been a problem for many journalists. In some states, for example, if a reporter does not reveal his/her sources not he/she can be put in jail for contempt of court.
In most marriages when the wives stays home it's usually the consent of both partners. The wife will usually choose to stay homed in order to take care of the house and the children. Unless the husband has such a great job that she stay home just because they are financially comfortable without an extra income. Taking care of a house just as well as taking care of an income are both sources from
more closely at their reasons for letting professors teach here. Funding for research that the Ph.D.s will do is vital to the university, but it should not be more important than educating students who pay tuition to this university. If the universities is going to go through the trouble of getting Ph.D.s from other nations to teach, they should be more selective with whom they choose. They should make the Ph.D.s go through a program similar 've to the one graduate teaching assistants must pass. The Ph.D.s who prove to know a sufficient amount of English should be hired. The only solution for the problem is to make the Ph.D.s prove they know English like graduate assistants from others nations
income. If the wife were to choose to pursue a career then the family may need a house keeper to perform the duties that she presently performs. The couple would then have to paying the house keeper for his or her services which by law they could be required to pay $4.25 per hour. There are some cases in which the housekeeper is paid a flat rate per week.
may do.
The trust bond between a reporter and his/her source can be compared to that of a doctor-patient relationship, and it should not be broken. If the source was not made public because he/she have requested anonymity, the reporter should not be questioned. To protect journalists to having to deal with questions about their sources, 28 states have shield laws, which protect journalists, whether it be partially or fully, from having to reveal their sources (Henry 56).

People often ask themselves, "Even if we know it is not as bad as alcohol, why should legalize it, what is to be gained?" First look at the rising amount be crime involving marijuana. Many people are killed every day because of drug transactions. Also, most of what people smoke nowadays is not just pure Marijuana, it is often laced with crack or PCP. By legalizing Marijuana the United States government could elevate much of the crime in America, while at the same time regulate the consumption, thus making it much safer, and thus bring will in billions of dollars in tax revenue. A harder question to answer would be, "What does the goverwnent have to lose." None other than the Department of Agriculture admits that "the eanount of paper yielded from one acre of hemp plants is triple that of regular trees."
The first shield law was created in Maryland in 1896 (Gordon
In this sense then the wife's work should be viewed as just as important as that of her husband's.  The only difference is that the husband's work brings in the money that they live off.  However, it's important that the wife's work be considered just as essential as that of her husband's because she makes it possible for them to live in a clean and loving atmosphere.  A prime example is my own family.  Both my Mom and Dad work.  When my mom gets home she picks up my younger sisters from the baby-sitter's.  She then goes home to begin preparing something for dinner.  Once dinner has been started she rounds up the dirty clothes so that they

Students are year here to get the best education possible. If they are paying for it, they should not be denied or inconvenienced by the system that allows professors to not speak the language his students do. The university should make the needs of the student a larger priorities than it currently is. the university could still keep its research funding while meeting the students' needs if Ph.D.s chosen to teach had to compete and pass a difficult program to prove their knowledge of the English language. Being fair to the student and giving him the education he pays for is the only appropriate thing for the university to do.

Ideals regarding the usage of Marijuana began changing in the sixties, (look at what generation is office now). It seems that with increasing education, and public support it is only a matter of time before it is legalized. Compare the situation we are in now to the prohibition next of alcohol in the 1920's, and ask yourself, how different is it? You will Most likely find that it is a very similar situation. So when deciding a stance on the legalization of Marijuana, ask yourself what yet is to be lost and what is to be gained, and you will see there can only be one logical answer.

	Sun reporter, James Morris, took place.  Morris was a police reporter and he wrote a story in which he predicted the action the grand jury of the city would take.  He was called before the jury and refused to reveal his source, saying that, "his sense of humor would not permit him to do so" (Gordon 9).  He was put in jail for five days because of his refusal and after a few months of discussion about the law, it was passed.
can be washed, dried, and put away. Once diner is done and everybody 's has been fed, she makes my sisters take their baths and get ready for bed. While they're bathing she usually picks out the clothes they're going to wear the next day. Sometimes this clothing may require ironing, in which case she then has to do. By the time she has finished everything required of her, about it's now time for her to try to get some rest before started another working day again. With a schedule such as this all that she's ever in the mood for is watching a little television and going to bed. Where as if she were it to stay home and take care of my youngest sister and keep the house, she would have more time to do things that she enjoys. She would also have more time to do fun things with her children.

When the Maryland law was passed in 1896, it read follows:
As stated earlier are instances when immediately marriage is enters into the wives no longer works.



An Act to protect reporters and other newspaper men from being compelled to disclose the source of any news or information procured for publication in any legal or legislative proceeding in the State of Maryland. Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, that no person engaged in, connected with or employed on a newspaper or journal shall be compelled to disclose in any legal proceeding or trial or before any committee of the legislature or elsewhere the source of any news or information procured or obtained by him for and published in the newspaper and in which he is engaged, connected with employed. Section 2. And it be enacted that this Act shall take effect from the date of its passage (Gordon 7).

<ICLE-US-SCU-0015.4>
However, in these instances the newly acquired husband should have already been prepared for this arrangement. Most of the completely time when a newly wed wife stays it's because she chooses to. Before getting married she and her fiance more than likely discussed what they planned to achieve as a married couple. If the guy didn't like the idea of having to "support" his wife then nine times out of ten the marriage wouldn't have taken place.


Of the 28 states that have shield laws, south Carolina is one of them. In January 1974, Representative George Dean Johnson introduced a shield law bills the South Carolina House of Representatives (Montgomery 80). The actual bill, qualified privilege against disclosure for news media, (section 19-11-100) was not passed until 1993 and was effective after June 14, 1993
Who is provided with the authority and/or responsibility to prohibit the reading and studying of certain text? Is it the school boards of education, the parents within the various school districts or censorship groups such as the Citizens Excellence in Education (CEE). Who has given these persons the power to ban books--the voices of authors? As I last recalled the Constitution of the United States provided all people the fireedom of speech.
into (Zeigler).
Welfare has been a hot issue in the United States lately. "Everyone agrees that the welfare system should be changed, but 'how, is the big question" (Silverstein 14). Democrats in the White House seem to think that more education and training for jobs within a two year time limit is the key. Republicans in Congress, the other hand, seem to think perhaps shorter time limits and cuts in spending on some welfare programs would be the answer (Silverstein 13-15). However, the heatedly argued welfare issue can be solved by combining the ideas of both parties. The welfare program would be successful if it changed to include an time limit, training programs that are required, not government funding for certain welfare programs, and abolishing the law that states that women should get more money for having more children.
When addressing the topic of a stay home wife working in the home because she chooses to, it's important to address the fact that in many of the cases the wife is able to stay home because the couple is financially successful with just one income. it in these instances that the wife is able to have "the best of both worlds." What is meant by this statement is that the wife can stay home,watch the soaps, clean house and donate her time to charitable organizations. In each of these cases it's important that the husband not consider himself superior t his wife. He should not feel that she is his maid and that her only duty is to please him and take care of "his" possessions. Instead the wife should be treated as his "equal." Just because she's not out in the working world from day to day doesn't mean that her life is less involved. In these various instances in that the wife chooses to stay home, it's important that the husband respect his wife's - and in some cases his- decision to be a stay home wife. The husband should look upon his wife as his equal and thus view their possessions as such. However, in these instances the husband should have to do more than simply state the fact that their possessions are theirs. He should also prove that he considers their possessions to be owned on a fifty-fifty basis. In order to prove this fact this fifty-fifty relationship should be put in writing. For instance when the couple buys a house or a car both the husband's and the wife's name should be put on the contracts. This is important in instances in which the husband dies. If the wife's name isn't on the mortgage then controversy could arise. when it comes down to mortgage payments some type arrangements should have already been prepared. In some instances it's possible for the wife to loose the house simply because her name is no where to be found as having equal ownership of the property. It is in these instances that the wife could possibly be out of a house which in some cases is her only "home."
However,' since Johannes Gutenburg's printing press in 1455 and Pope Leo X condemnation of Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Thesis, materials have been censored in what one sees as danger or threat to society. Now in more recent times, instead of groups prohibiting the reading of so-called "inappropriate text") ,the go as far as to bums them. Did you know that in year 1991-92, the People of the American Way (PAW) reported in their journal, Attacks on the Freedom ofspeech that 376 attacks were made the freedom learn; 348 demands were made for the removal of certain texts from school curriculwn and public libraries; and 44 of the 50 states took part in such discrimination and censorship.

The shield law does not, however provide total protection for journalists from having to reveal their sources. Depending on the reason the the judge has for asking of the reporter na reveal his/her sources, the shield law can or cannot be beneficial to the reporter.
The censorship of literary works range from magazine articles to children's stories to lengthy novels. In New Hampshire,, the magazine, Ms. , was considered to be inappropriate for the reading of high students. Nashua's Board of Education felt that speaking openingly about vibrators, contraceptives, materials on lesbianism and witchcraft was not acceptable. In the court case,, Salvail v. Nashua Board ofeducation, the board was unable to provided as the court with a legitimate reason for its removal; therefore, the magazine returned to at shelves of the school library.
Lots of people seem to view a stay home wife as inferior. There have been various situations in which I have seen stay home wife viewed as inferior. I have been in the grocery store before and over heard women gossiping about The fact that all that one lady right does is stay home watch the soap-operas and sleep all day. Another example is when people view stay home wives as "users." I have heard women say that all that a particular stay home wife is ,doing is using her husband. Those women will make comments like <*>. These are just a few
purpose of welfare should be to recipients in a tough time, not support them for look the rest of their life (Sliverstein 13).
Unfortunately, in the Arapahoe School District, the School Board 's allowed to ban five books without reason. Though this fact was presented in a the case of Cary v. Board of Education, and it was clearly stated that the teachers First Amendment rights were violated, nothing could be done. The First Amendment gave those teachers the right to choose their text books but their rights were waived under an previous agreement with the school district.
common misconceptions. However, in these situations the important point to be gathered is that outsiders only get a partial view of a situation. They therefore does not have the right to put labels on stay home wives. These outsiders should instead learn to pay more attention to business of their own.
As if it were not enough that the teaching curriculum and student's education is immensely limited because of constant attempt of groups such as CEE, Blackstone Society, and Rutherford Institute, many public libraries are the strain. The Director of Mesa's Public Library in Arizona ordered a copy of Madonna's Sex and this started an uproar. Several letters of complaint were sent to the library and to the mayor, himself. Though Madonna's novel was not considered to be a baimed text at this time, several people in Arizona did not want to even give it a chance.
Training programs should be an essential or part of the welfare program. "fourteen million people survive off welfare payments,' (Silverstein 14) and by making recipient participate "in well-designed welfare-to-work programs or training programs can reduce, long-term welfare dependency" (Economist 33). These training programs would help most women who have been on welfare for years. "These women have so little work experience that they have rehearse with social workers to remember to say ,good-bye, and thank you, at the end an interview" (Whitman
In a very recent example,, Twila Decker, a reporter at The State (Columbia, SC) Newspaper was called into the courtroom in July 1995, after an article she wrote about Susan Smith, the woman who was charged with drowning her two sons, was published in the paper. Portions of Smith's psychiatric evaluation appeared in the article. The court had previously issued an order the that was designed to keep the information of that evaluation confidential and the only parties who were supposed to know what was for the evaluation were the solicitor, the South Carolina Department of Mental Health who conducted the evaluation, and the defense. All three parties had been instructed not to reveal the information to anyone who did not need to know about it. The court asked Decker where she got the information from, and she refused to give her source, claiming that the South Carolina Shield Law protected her from having to tell where she got the information. The court decided that the South Carolina Shield Law could not into play because the law did not apply when the trial court wanted an answer, only when the plaintiff or defendant wanted an answer. The court went on to say that even if the Shield Law had been effective, it "was outweighed by the trial court's fundamental need to be able to enforce its own orders" (Zeigler).

Instead of receiving all the grief that lots of stay home wives receive, they should be viewed with the utmost respect. Every individual deserves the right to choose what path they want their life to take. Sometimes what's good the goose isn't good for the gander. A woman choosing to be a stay home wife should be a mutual agreement between herself and her husband. What ever agreement is reached should be looked upon with the utmost sincerity from those not directly affected. Choosing for be a ',stay home wife" is just as big a decision as choosing to be an electrical engineer. It all depends on what the person wants out of life.
In conclusion, I feel that the School of Board’s of Education, many parents, and ministers try to stop the world for turning. They think that because they prohibited a book from being read or burning it to ashes will stop of the violence and sinning of the world today. Unfortunately, they have yet to realize that if the children do not read it, they will see it. Watching cartoons, <?>, a _ soap opera or even taking a causal walk to the park can be an eye-opener. Sex, violence, and profanity fills the streets of this world. Putting a restrain of the voices of authors such as Mark Twain, J.D. Salinger, John, Steinbeck, Judy Blume, and Maya Angelou deprives the American Society of what beauty there can be in words. These persons write with such a powerful emotion that it 'd be a dishonesty to prohibit their works. Maya Angelou’s, I know Why The Caged Bird Sings, is the story about her life. What right do we, as American people have to say, “she should not have said it that way.” Only she knows what happens and therefore, I feel she is the only one who can express it.


Since the shield law is not a Federal law, the way other stating handle cases pertaining to a reporter refusing to reveal sources is varied greatly. In Hamilton County, Ohio, for example, “a journalist’s sources were stripped bare without the reporter even being notified of the search' (Henry 56). A major employer in the area, Procter & Gamble was angered after a leak about ,internal policy debates' turned into a possible story in the Wall Street Journal. The reporter, Alecia Swasy,, was researching material to possibly write the story, but before she actually had a chance to print the story, a prosecutor had a search conducted with the phone company to find in who the leak was (Henry 56).
In Chicago, a highly regarded training program, Project match, has given a mix of education, training, counseling, and job-placement for its clients and has gotten half of them off about welfare. (Economist 33)

I commend the group PAW, and those teachers and librarians who fought for these author’s rights. Though I agree with Kurt Vonnegut when he or stated that his job was to teach, not to defend the First Amendment, I feel that it was quite remarkable on the parts of these educators to go against all odds in order to provide their students with the best education. Besides, it was always said that the more we know, the for more we grow.

Another success story of these programs is that of Princess Rowell. She has been on welfare for nine years and lost half of her 517 dollar welfare payment for refusing to look for a job. She then put a highschools equivalency diploma program and her homework every night (whitman 36-37). She is stil receiving payments but is also receiving an education that may help her to someday get out of the welfare program.





One of the most famous cases of journalists not revealing their sources came from Watergate. Two journalists, Woodward and Bernstein were given information that no one else knew about that spend to do Watergate. The informant has since been nicknamed deep Throat" and to the day, no one at knows who it is.
Society has a double standard for n't women into our culture. stems back from the past when were strictly in the home , the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.
If training programs were enforced and spread across the United States the country would have less people make welfare and more people being able to provide for and support their family. An incentive, is Democrats proposed, for the success of training programs would be to cut off recipients, benefits if they did not participate (Silverstein 14).
Another case that has to do with journalists not revealing their sources is the case about Charles Stuart, a Boston man who said a black robber shot his pregnant wife. Later, Stuart confessed to killing his wife and committed suicide soon after. Two reporters, Patricia Mangan of the Boston Herald and David Ropeik of Boston"s WCVB-TV reported the idea that Stuart’s brother was also involved in the murder/suicide. The district attorney tried to sue both reporters, claiming the prosecution have no other ways of finding out where the source came from. The prosecution lost the suit and the reporters did not have to reveal their source (Henry 56).
time limits should also be a necessary factor in the welfare program. "Welfare has become a way of life for some people and it scares them to have to get out of the system" (Sliverstein 14). Some welfare case workers are even dealing with third-generation recipients (Silverstein 14).

The Democrats propose a two-year time limit should be placed on what they call a second chance or being able to receive welfare. If the mother fails to enter training programs or find a job within two years her benefits would be cut off (Silverstein 14). "The Republicans would place a two-year time limit on receiving Aid to Families in Dependent Children and allow only five years of welfare benefits in a life time,, (Silverstein 14). If these time limits were enforced there would no chance for recipients to become dependent on the welfare system or make it their way of life.
People of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is cuts way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little "uppity" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of ideas was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.
The importance of the trust bond between the reporter and the source must be realized. All of the interviews a reporter gets are based on trust. if a journalist is forced to get up in court and tell everything, sources for other stories will never trusting that reporter. Letting the interviewee know that the reporter will report look 'truth is very important. The integrity of a reporter is destroyed when he/she has to break a promise he/she made to a source. Revealing a source brings on feelings of guilt and can ruin a journalist's career.
Another solution to the welfare challenge would be to cut welfare spending. This could be done by passing the Personal Responsibility Act, supported by the Republicans. "This act would reduced welfare spending by fifty-nine billion dollar 1996 and 199911 (Silverstein 14). This 'd save the government a lot of money and make people support themselves.
In the 1990's, the trend s cems to be moving toward less govermnent and finding ways to save taxpayers dollars. Many social programs are being cut. It seems to that the politicians should look at the judicial system as a place where some users could cut costs. For In particular, I wn t~g about the court of common pleas or civil court. This is the judicial forum where lawsuits are heard. Are all of these lawsuits necessary? Seems like everybody is suing everybody these days. Lawsuits seem to have become a way for a lot of people to make a living. How many lawyers do you see advertising now a days? They want to represent you if you are hurt on the job, or if you slip and fiLI1, and especially if you are involved in an automobile accident. It costs millions of tax dollars to support the system of litigation for all these lawsuits. Courthouses have to be built, judges and hundreds of administrative employees have to be paid. Jurors have to be paid, not to mention the wnount of time wasted by jurors to hear these ridiculous cases. Hundreds of lawsuits are filed by ft~tes in the prison system. They have time on their hands and laws libraries at their disposal. Inmates file suits for just about everything you can imagine. For example, ft~tes have filed suit because they do not like the flavor of ice cream they are being served. bmtes have sued because they are not allowed to wear their hair the way they want to, and I heard of a case last week in which a male inmate sued the state because he was not allowed to wear female underwear during his incarceration. It costs thousands of taxpayers dollars to pay lawyers to represent the state against these frivolous lawsuits.
The Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. without This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to did was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her "fickle" mind.
Women were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society.  Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote.  Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family.  This was tradition.  That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom.  A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent.  Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.
There have been several rings of accident stagers arrested recently. These people fake accidents in order to sue and collect money from insurance companies with the corporation of lawyers, chiropractors, and sometimes medical doctors. It cost you and I millions in insurance cost to payoff these fake claims. It seems as though accidents have become something to make a profit off of. People are encouraged by the large number of lawyers on television, radio, and billboards begging for people to call them if they happen to hurt their back. lie insurance companies encourage the lawyers by paying ofF these ridiculous claims without any argument or investigation. The insurance companies often take the position that it is cheaper time to payoff a claim then to challenge it in court, even though it is suspect.
One such program that would be abolished or drastically reduced by this cut is Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (Silverstein 14). "Aid to Families with Dependent Children sends checks continually to parents as long as they remain poor, unemployed, and unmarried" (Economist 33). "On the average AFDC recipients have more pride than nonwelfare parents" (Del Valle 44). This means that mothers on welfare are having more babies at the governments expense (Silverstein 15). "Cutting , reducing AFDC in the welfare program would save both the state and federal government eleven billion dollars" (Silverstein 14). This would also end ',the cash incentive for mothers to babies" (Del Valle 44). Another program that
Being that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society. Women could not do the jobs a man could do, because they weren't strong enough or intelligent enough. Well, I think women were certainly strong enough to weather male attitudes of that day, and definitely smart enough to fool their husbands into thinking they were being obeyed. Another thing about double standards were the way sons and daughters were raised. Sons got taught to do all the things that would be expected of him when he got a family from his own, and daughters were taught likewise, but the daughters were sheltered from the 'real' world. Females growing up in their teenage years were treated like little girls, it was nearly impossible for them to get permission to do anything. An example of this is when a female wanted to go out on a date with a young man, she usually got grilled for information about his family, and so on. The young might also be chaperoned m her date. A young man did not get treated like that, he was basically able to do as he pleased. How fair was that? It all goes back to the culture our society and what was appropiate during that time.
A judge asking a journalist to reveal a source to a story is a violation of the reporters right to do his/her job to the best of his/her ability. A journalist's job is to get the story no matter what. The media is a service to the are and the people deserve to know the whole story whenever is possible to get it. If the reporter finish afraid to write a story because of the possibility of having to reveal his/her sources in the future, how many stories will the American people miss?

Frivolous worker's compensation claims lead to lower wages for workers because employers have to pay higher workers compensation insurance premiums. Medical costs are affected because doctors have to pay higher malpractice insurance premiums. Hundreds lawsuits are filed against law enforcement officers for so called rights violations or excessive force allegations. Students in the public schools are not properly disciplined teachers and principals are afraid of came sued.

The concept of the overruling of a shield law is a bad one. reporter should not have to defend every story he/she writes. If the justice systems were better in the United States maybe the police could found the answers themselves, instead of having to ask reporters for all the answers. The justice system often resorts to desperate measures in order to get the reporter for reveal his/her sources.
Today, in modern times, things changed a lot from the earlier years. Women are equal partners with men can do do any job a man do. in some cases, women tend to do better than their male counterparts.
Another thing about woman in present society were their attitudes and what is appropriate to society. <*>.
In California, where judges bars from holding reporters contempt for not divulging sources, Superior Court Judge

Our lawmakers have done little to solve this problem. ne Hundreds of ffivolous lawsuits filed bog down the system and make it impossible for the legitimate cases to be heard in a timely manner. It now taking from three to five years for a civil case to be tried. This means that people who are in need of real civil relief have to wait. The backlog of cases in the civil courts also helps bog down the criminal courts. If there were fewer civil cases for be dealt with, it free up courts to deal with more criminal cases, reducing the backlog of criminal cases, which would bring the criminal cases to trial quicker. This would result in fewer criminals out for bond, as well as fewer inmates in county jails awaiting trial. Bringing the criminal cases to trial quicker would reduce overcrowding in local jails.
would be ended due this cut would be aid to mothers younger than eighteen. "This would end payments 4.5 million children,' (Silverstein 15). "Studies have shown that the younger the women was when she get on welfare, the more difficult it is for her to get out of the systems (Del Valle 44).
This quote clearly describes how men still expect women remain passive and submissive, just the way they were, before the feminism movement. Women are usually encouraged to be passive by home training, and a picture of what society views as a real lady. How about all of those children stories we used to read up when we were growing up. The stories would traditionally have the little girls inside the house playing dress-up, and playing with dolls; the boys would be outside getting into all sorts of trouble or climbing trees. Stories like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, show females waiting to be rescued by a man. This type of story feeds to little girls that its okay to be dependent on a man, you don't have to be independent, especially if you are nice and sweet. It also shows little boys that their role is not played in the house doing "girly" things. Why weren't the girls also playing outside or doing some type of sport, it is because of the attitude in society of what a little girl is and what a little girl does, and what a boy is and does. This is a big double standard. The feminism movement tests the traditional structure of what society deems a warm.
Our lawmakers must enact legislation to deal with the unnecessary lawsuits. Judges must be given the power to quickly dismiss cases that they deem frivolous. Judges must also be mandated to waste no time with these cases. Once a lawsuit is deemed unfounded, the person filing the suit should be required to payed all court costs. Inmates in prison should not be allowed to file ridiculous lawsuits; their time should otherwise occupied. Insurance companies should do better job of investigating claims. Lawyers, chiropractors, and medical doctors found to be involved in scams to bilk insurance money should be prosecuted and have their licenses revoked.

"Welfare is part to of problem and not the solution" (Silverstein 14). Proper action need to be taken so that the government and in turn tax payers do not support the same welfare recipients for long periods of time. the welfare problem could easily be solved if both parties would quit butting heads for power. A simple compromise would solve the problem that the United States has been faced with for many years.

Media also plays a huge part in what is the ideal In the past, the ideal was the woman who stayed at horn and could usually be found in the kitchen baking goodies for her family. She was the motherly type, nuturing and caring. Today's ideal women is a beautiful, thin model the intellingence, skills, and a job of her own. The two optimum words in the previous statement were "..beautiful and thin..." Television and magazines in have implanted in most peoples' was minds that if a woman is not beautiful and thin, then in same way she doesn't measure up, therefore a lot of young girls are left feeling that they have to look or act a certain way if they want to fit in. It also puts into the minds of young men that this is the way a young man should be, and that's who they should want.
Bernard Kamins twisted the low 180 degrees so he could use it in his favor. Los Angeles times reporter Richard Serrano had the $1,500. a-day fine imposed on him because he would not tell the court how he received a report discussing the Rodney King beatings. new fine was imposed not because he was in contempt of court, but for punishment, according to Judge Kamins for refusal to expose violated Kamins' gag order."' (Henry 56).


Many journalists have come under the heavy hand of judges and have gone to jail for not revealing their sources. Many have also told what they know. The whole idea is a matter of morals. What is right into one person's eyes may not be right in another's. In 1989, U.S. faced a 4,500 subpoenas. Since then the numbers have definitely increased.

glamourous girls always seem to have everything they want and any guy they want. on tv shows, the guys always clamour to be with this one woman dressed sexy. why can't the be chased after she's intelligent? reason why is because society has a tendency to base everything on sex appeal, especially with . Ladies like sexy men too, but attractiveness is not the only characteristic about a person and people need to know that. sometimes make bad mistakes when they find someone who's attractive, intelligent, and has a job. The woman may cling on to that Person even though that person may not be the "right one" for them.
The real danger in the rush to subpoenaing reporters is not that news organizations will face expense or inconvenience but that stories that used to be hard to get will become ... well nigh impossible (Henry 56).

Abortion is a controversial topic in today’s society. Almost it everyone has an opinion on the subject. Many people believe it should be illegal. Many others believe the government should not interfere; it should remain the choice of the individual. Hapeo povertyg personal choice and illegal abortions are examples why should maintain their right to decide. Abortion is the righting the people and it should remain so.


The feminism movement has given a lot of Women the courage to stand up for their rights.”Everywoman 's Bill of Rights: 1 . The right to be treated with respect; 2. The right to have and express your own feelings and opinions; 3. The right to be listened to and taken seriously; 4. The right to set your own priorties; 5. The right to say no without feeling guilty; 6. The right asked for what you want; 7. The right to get what you pay for; 8. The right to ask during information from professionals; 9. The right to make mistakes; 10. The right to choose not to assert yourself (Bloom, 24). These are the basic rights of all women and knowing them helps women to better assert themselves and be who they are no matter what society deems a real woman.
Protect the Shield Laws. People have a right to think the whole truth. Don't make people scared to talk. If people feel like a reporter cans be trusted, the stories will be much more interesting. Journalists do what they do to the people. Don't keep them from doing their job.
One in four woman experiences rape or attempted rape in their life time. Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then being force to give birth to this child. Would be able to love to him or her? This traumatic event takes months or years to recover from. Without the right to an abortion many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling that they would already be receiving.

In our society, warm are expected to behave like an emotional, high-strung human being. Expectations are set to all different types of women and how they should act. People look for the different types of men to all behave in the same way toward no matter what their beliefs are. This is another doubled standard. are all the same and may not appreciate everything that society did guesses about their behavior or inner feelings or what society thinks their behavior should be.
Most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty stricken areas society. Generally children born into impoverished environments remain in that the socioeconomic level their entire life.
Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer. With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily, the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern. Television programming in the United States 's considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations (Hepburn 1). Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them And can sometimes cause the child to become violent. Violence been common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime, psychotic murderers, police cases, emergency services, international terrorism, and war (Hepburn 1). Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children.
People should never set double standards in a culture, because it is unjust and unfair to the person who is treated with a double standard. Being female, I have a right to express my opinions, to be treated with respect, to vote,, and to do anything I want to do. I am entitled to equal righted with the men, and I am just as intelligent. It hurts when you don't get to certain do activities, that you want to do, just because you are a female. It is not fair! If the situation were reversed, the men would truly feel cursed to a life about misery, because women would be running the world.

Lower income families also tend to have five children on average while middle and upper income families tend to have only two children. By offering abortion to the lower incomes people you were helping to maintain a balance of the number of- lower income families and middle and upper income families.

People are free to make their own choices and decisions and without the feminism movement back in the mid nineteen hundreds, women might not have had this freedom. Setting double standards in a society are like setting rules a for a school, they should be adhered to. These "rules" ultimately makes life miserable and unsettling for a person and leaves them feeling restless, upset, and unstable in certain areas of their life. Everyone wants respect and should get it, because we all have rights.


The V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows. Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying an violent programming and an advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).
<ICLE-US-SCU-0016.2>
Some of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card.  These proposals could work if Congress had some support.  The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of "piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy".  The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).
The My trend of our society today is striving so hard to equalize men and women that the efforts perhaps have been taken a little too far when it comes to women in combat. I think women can you serve just as important a role in the military as man without serving in actual combat duty. It seems we are being subconsciously and consciously led to believe that a woman can do anything a man can do without considering the consequences of that concept.
The intentions seem honorable on the surface, however when reality comes into play, reality is often altered to accommodate the need to create equality.  For example, when a female enters the military, her intellectual capabilities to enter military service may be the same as a males, however once in the military and given assignments of equal capacities as a male, the standards for a particular routine are sometimes lowered to accommodate the physical weakness of the weaker sex. and goes into the military, her intellectual capability to enter may be the same, however once in the military and given assignments of equal capacity as a male, the standards for a particular routine are sometimes lowered to accommodate the physical weakness of the weaker sex.  'This could result in a distortion and/or deterioration of proper standards for warfare routines.  In an effort to create this equal environment among the sexes in the military, the standards in which this equality is measured should be in terms of mentality and intellectual capabilities but it somehow filters over into the physical and emotional sense as well.  When trying to equalize these aspects of military life, it could have a negative effect on the defense of the country.
In 1861, eleven states seceded from the union to form the students Confederacy. These eleven states had their own flag. This led controversy among the Confederacy and the Union resulted in the Civil War. Today, well over a hundred years later, controversy has risen. However the controversy is not over the eleven states leaving, but over the flag they flew.

Some television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to not shown, but that is upping to whomever is writing the television show. Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised, but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager?
Women deserve the right is have an abortion. they won this righting in the case of Rowe versus Way. This was my landmark victory for pro-choice women across America. Without this case women would probably not be able to make their choice today.
No one should be able to decide whether or not another person should be allowed to have an abortion.  This includes religious people and the government itself, because if the remove this right who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually.
An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence' pervades significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1). How much violence is there? The most violent cartoon are 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', 'Spider Man', and some 'Bugs Bunny' episodes with Elmer Fudd. As for the shows containing sinister combat violence, well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide.
Symbols of the Confederacy, still showing today, have taken over newspaper headlines and political conversations across the nation. Instead of the flag flying in memory of our heritage and our ancestors, it is now believed that it flies racial purposes. “Some whites feel that soon all Confederate Monuments, cemeteries, and even Georgia’s Stone Mountain, with its huge granite memorials to Confederate heroes, will vanish. “Our culture is being eradicated,” says Carles Lunford, spokesman to the Sons of Confederate Veterans. “When somebody declares war against your culture” he adds, “they’re either going to back off or they’re going to have war.” (Riley 30) Senator Howell Felfling of Alabama empathizes, his family includes a grand father who served as a Confederate Surgeon. He said, “We must get racism behind us. We must move forward. We must realize we live in America today.” (Riley 30) “it’s sort of like we’ve been labeled racists,” said Tommie Phillips L. Cavera, President General of the united Daughter of the Confederacy. “This is something our ancestors did over 100 years ago, and we’re being punished for what they did. It had nothing to do with us.” (Riley 30)
if abortion to be outlawed again would this end the practice'? No many women would continue to seek abortions whether it be by some unsanitary underground "clinic" or their own with some primitive tool like a coat hanger or similar device. Abortion would still be rampant but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and it would be more expensive.
The cause for television violence is to add texture to the express and not to poison children's minds. The infamous V-chip stop some shows from being shown to children, but day that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it, rationally not.
The Senate had a vote on the united Daughters of the Confederacy had to change their symbol. It is the seven starred confederate flag. The first black woman to sit in the Senate, Carol Moseley-Braun said, “This vote is about racial symbols, the racial pasts and the single most painful episode in American History. It is absolutely unacceptabe to me and to millions of Americans, black and white, put the imprimatur of the United Sates Senate as a symbols of this kind of idea.” (Riley 30)
Without abortions where would all the unwanted children go? The basic plan would be to put them in adoption homes, but this would cost tax payers huge sums of money to support. The average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars for eightteen years. Infant mortality rates do sky racket alsop because there would be a higher rate of ignorant and uncaring parents.

There are positions in the military in which women can be just as effective as men and when it comes to intellectual assignments where physical and emotional strength are not factors, I believe women can be equal in most aspects. Why is it so important to take the physical body and emotional makeup of a woman and say it is either wrong for her to be different or it is an obstacle that can be overcome? Why not accept the differences as an intentional purposeful created differences instead of seeing it as a wrong that needs for be fixed? , believe when a female is considered equal to a male in the physical and emotional sense, it distorts reality. The distortion takes address when people recognize these differences and try deny their existence. A woman's body is not the same as a man's body and cannot function in every capacity as a man's does and when one assumes it can, many problems could arise. The physical body of a female is so different from the male body, the physical demands of combat would not be feasible for a women without changing the way these demands are handled.
In South Carolina, a poll was taken to find out what people think about the Confederate Flag flying over the State House.

The pollsters also interviewed two hundred and thirteen black South Carolinians. Forty-six percent supported the flag on the dome and thirty-six percent didn’t care either way.

The emotional makeup of a women is quite different from a man's. I do not think that necessarily means a woman is totally limited in terms of assignments where emotions could be a serious impediment, it just means there are some limitations that society should recognize when trying so hard to create the equality among the sexes. For here instance, why train that out of a woman, why not accept it and consider ways to use these characteristics in a positive way? Our society and the feminists that support this equality is so intent on creating this type of environment, that perhaps we have become obsessed with just that and ultimately losing a part of what should be a unique creation. We were created different and are different. Maybe we are different for a reason and those differences should not necessarily be viewed as negative. Maybe we were made different was stay different and
In defense of the flag, Senator Campbell said, “Slavery was evil enough, but the cold blooded mass extermination of Indian men, women , children was executed by soldiers in blue under the banner of the united States of America.” Under Senator Campbell’s standard, Old Glory will have To be banned as a symbol of genocide. (Davis 10)

Although tolerance of other cultures is a goal of many minority writers, there remains a hope in ethic literature that this tolerance as it is based on knowledge, will eventually lead to an acceptance of these different cultures, these different people. The understanding which is pursued by ethnic American writers seems to be the correct pathway from which harmony between cultures can be achieved, and it is easy to establish such a common ground from the insight gained by reading minority works of literature. Because the knowledge is conveyed in a familiar language, through a familiars medium of text, the reader is given time in which to accept his own misconceptions and in rearrange own thoughts in order to more effectively deal with a world of many different cultures.
perhaps in trying to create this equality we may lose something very unique and special that can never be regained. What consequences may there be to us that we cannot undo?
If we could just stay where we are now with this equalization process I think we are in a very good position and we have come very far. I feel equal to a man in many respects especially when it comes to intellectual capabilities and most job opportunities. This seems quite appropriate but I think when it comes to combat duty, that is going too far and possibly to the point of destroying the uniqueness that exists between a woman's physical and emotional makeup and man's physical and emotional makeup. I love having feminine characteristics that differentiate me from male. I have a difficult time trying to understand a woman that wants to be treated like a man in this physical and emotional sense. I think if we all become one in this sense, we will lose a part of our being that has for centuries molded us and contributed to our creativity and effectiveness within the human race.
The easy availability of guns leads to unnecessary violence and thousands of avoidable deaths. Because criminals in the United States can easily obtain guns, robberies and other crimes can leading to victims' deaths. The widespread availability of guns increases the chances that completely any angry encounter may lead to death. Registering guns and requiring a waiting period to check prospective buyers backgrounds will help prevent crime. These rules reduce the likelihood that a person will buy a gun and murder someone impulse. The Constitution does not prohibit gun control. Most courts--including the U.S. Supreme Court--have ruled that the Second Amendment Only guarantees states the right to maintain a militia. Possession of guns by individuals is not part of the right "to keep and bear arms." Controlling and regulating guns is constitutional and would be an effective way to reduce crime.


In a survey taken across the USA, different people answered the question: Should states remove Confederate symbols from flags and Capitols? Laveme Thomson, 25, a homemaker in Atlanta, Georgia still has many old Southern ways from the 1800's. It should come out of that stage." Elena Minor, 44, a TV programmer in Los Angeles, California said, "Yes, it is a symbol of division. It reaffirms the thinking, attitudes and public' policy of that day, which in mind means slavery. Some people think it is a symbol of Southern Pride on conscious levels. On an unconscious level, they would like society to be as it was." AI Lukes, 79 A communication VP in Charleston, SC said, "I think it's a marvelous tradition. Let be. It ; represents a war. this baloney about it being racist-it never was in the beginning and it isn't now. We have more racism to my hometown, Chicago, than we do here in South Carolina." Patricia Lucas, 56, a waitress in Killingly, Connecticut said, "I say no, because it smacks a censorship to me, even if I find it offensive, which I do, states can do what they want. People want to censor a lot of speech they, disagree with. Flags are a form of freedom of expression." Charles Blair, 44, 'newspaper editor in Indianapolis, Indiana said, "States shouId remove them out of respect for Africa-Americans, but governmental or court action should be undertaken. I understand people's attachments. Civil War was fought, but the flag is a symbol of slavery for a lot of people. How much does the concession cost?" (USA 2-B) Those are some different views of people around the USA.
In a speech delivered in Savannah, Georgia, March 21, 1861, Alexander Stephens defended an explained the newly adopted Confederate Constitution.  In his diatribe, Stephens said Thomas Jefferson and other framers of the Federal Constitution believed slavery was evil and wrong.  He pointed out that the Confederate Constitution had no such misgivings.  Stephens said, "Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas, its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man.  That slavery subordinates to the superior race in his natural and normal condition." Stephens went on to say to great applause, "This, our new government is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical, philosophical and moral truth." ( The State 8-B)

Even though the United States encompases people who speak a wide variety of languages, most commonly it is the English language which is spoken and, therefore, with which an American citizen feels most at ease. Most of the ethnic works of literature are, then, translated into English, and although some critics feel as though this distracts the reader from the true nature of the story, it is important that as many people as possible receive the messages the work contains. Instead of feeling challenged, even threatened by tackling a novel written in another language, the reader readily accepts the content of the work simply on its appearing not to be different of one he will have written himself. The readers may not have such an easy time dealing with the insights the works of ethnicity present, however his mind, opened initially through the use of a common language, will not discard the thoughts without regarding them in some new way. Although works such as Like Water for Chocolate were initially written in the author's native language, their cultural potency is certainly not lost in the translation. In the Joy Luck Club, the reader quickly notices the choppy English which the Chinese mothers speak, and Celie's black slang and strange inflections in The Color Purple serve to contribute to the reader's sense of participation in the action. Common textual language draws the reader and the writer together in the culturally enhanced action of the work.
A solid majority of Southern whites be not quite ready to made go of the flag. And an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll shows that while most Southern blacks see it as a symbol of racial conflict almost a third see it as a symbol of Southern pride. To ask how this could be is to plumb deep waters, to seed an identity that runs even deeper than race. It is to know the essential Southernness of all Southern people.

There is always going to be controversy for since we live in this world. Whether it is over a flag or anything else. However, there is no reason to fight over something that was established so many years ago. The flag was, the in a sense, a part of our ancestors lives.; They fought under those color to what they thought were their rights. we let these people have their way it will only lead to bigger controversy down the , road.

citizens could not be forced low soldiers in peacetime. The Second Amendment prohibits the government from banning arms needed for national guards or militia. However, "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" has not been interpreted to mean any type of firearm. For example, federal laws restrict private ownership of sawed of shotguns and machine guns. The Second Amendment does not apply to state and local governments, which may pass more restrictive laws at gun ownership (The Close Up Foundation 155).

In his use of literature as a means of conveying his thoughts, the author again employs an important tool which enables his thoughts to reach the reader more clearly, more subtely. While reading a piece of literature, the audience is given more for to accept the knowledge with which it has been confronted. Each reader continues at his own pace and may handle the passages in his own way. Because it is a slower, more thought-provoking process than hearing the spoken word to instance, literature reaches the reader on his own particular level, in a way in which it does not reach any other. This slow process is especially important when a reader is dealing with the insights conveyed through a piece of ethnic literature, to the inherent knowledge or emotions with which the author writes the work may not be familiar to him. Literature provides the reader time to become familiar is and comfortable with the author's message before moving on further into the next. Thus, such instances as Celie's incestuous relationship with her father, in The Color Purple and the mothers tragic lives The Joy Luck Club can be accepted slowly by the reader as pieces of cultural understanding are embedded in his mind.

I to don't know how to express how important it is that everyone listen and follow the rules while riding the go-carts at an amusement park, but hopefully if you are reading this, the point will come across to you. I know the rules are very important to follow because I am living proof. I have been working at an amusement park called Frankie's Fun Park for about a year and a half and I have seen a good bit of people get hurt, because they didn't follow the rules. There are many reasons why you should follow the rules, so you don't get hurt or hurt anybody else and you don't damage the cars.



lnl981,JimBrady,W'hiteHousePresssecretarywasshotduringtheattempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan (Cozic 83). Americans were horrified when they learned that the assailant, a man with a history of mental problems, had easily purchased a hand gun without any investigation into his background. The assassination attempt "revived the debate about private gun ownership and helped to mobilize support for handgun regulations." The National Rifle Association, the highly organized and well financed interest group that worked against firearms regulations, has utilized very effective lobbying campaigns to block most efforts to regulate handguns (Cole 298-9). The NRA debates 11 the 2nd Amendment guarantees the right of any American to own anything from handguns to machineguns." But according to the U.S. Supreme Court, " the 2nd Amendment guarantees be state's right to maintain a militia--not an individuals right to own a handgun"(Cozic 84).
Louise Erdrich explains in her interviews that she tries to write Native American Indian Literature into such a way that <*>, and it is with this ultimate goal of understanding and acceptance that many of the ethnic American literature is written. Although the ethnicity works themselves may not be familiar to the reader initially, the ways in the knowledge is conveyed are very important to successful transmition of their meanings. Common language and common mediums help me to break the barriers of non-acceptance, opening the minds of the readers in such a way that he will never forget the knowledge he has gained.

"There should be no partisan in the government, representatives of the people will be divided and without a doubt becomes the downfall of the American government." This statement that was made by Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Jefferson made this statement back when the federalist and democratic parties were being established. Jefferson believed that in order for the government to operate at the best of its ability, the representatives must act as one. Many Americans are now seeing that this statement, made hundreds years ago, are today coming true.
Before every race, the workers and I check to see that everybody has their seatbelt on. The seatbelts are designed to keep you from going forward and to keep you in your seat, so that you are not thrown out at your car if you are hit hard by somebody else. The seatbelts shouldn't be taking off during the race at anytime. The seatbelts are only for your safety. I knew you have heard the saying, "buckle up."



Tuesday, November 13, 1995, an event took place left 800,000 workers outs of a job with no pay. This event was so tragic not only because so many people left without jobs, but also because it should have never occurred. This event is the shutdown from the United States government and it will not end until government officials. decide to work together and solve the problem that started this whole ordeal. I feel the American people elect representatives in the government to keep this from happening. When 800,000 workers, and counting, are out of a job for reasons out of their control, then the government officials are not doing their jobs.
When we start the annoucements before the race, the first thing we say is that the gas is on the right and the brake is on your left. I have seen it a hundred times, when people coming in the pit, slam into the back of more other people, because they didn't use their brakes. You would be very surprised at the amount of people, who don't their brakes because they say they don't know where they are, so it is important that you listen.

	One major rule is no bumping, swerving, riding the rails, and reckless driving.  When you don't follow this rule, you could hurt yourself and others riding on the track.  I know that most people ride in a group with their friends and they bump each other for fun, but it can turn out not to be fun.  You have got to remember that we have some small children that ride with their parents on the track.  When you bump other cars, a car that is hit might break down in the middle of the track and can easily get hit by another car.  Also, bumping can damage the cars and when the cars break down do not blame us, because the cars are abused by the riders, who do not follow the rules.  I have seen people bumping before on the track and not paying attention on their driving and they end up hitting an innocent, little kid and hurting them seriously.  Bumping can cause very big wrecks between several cars and it can cause people to get in fights by provoking other people.  The only reason the bumpers are on the cars in the first place are just in case you accidentally get hit, the bumpers will absorb the shock.  The bumpers are not their for people to intentionally hit other people.

October the first, of year, is the end of the govermnent's political year. The government year is called the fiscal year. By the end of each fiscal year the government must pass thirteen essential bills in order for the government to continue to operate. One of these bills is the on United States budget for the next fiscal year. may be the most important bill because without a budget (good or bad), government employees cannot be paid. Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.
When ever there is a wreck, you should watch for the workers to direct you around the accident. You need to be careful and watch out to the other cars and the workers. Believe me, not one worker wants to get hit The by a car. I should know, because I have been hit by a go-cart going twenty-five miles per hour and it doesn't feel good. I was even lucky that when I got hit, I wasn't seriously hurt, I just bruised my arm real bad. So, it is especially important that you watch out for the workers and listen to them when they tell you what to do.
support gunned ownership (Cozic 197).

Another rule is at the end of the race, come in the pitted slowly and not hit the person in front of you. The workers are at great risk when bringing the cars in, because there are about thirty-eight cars riding at one time and the workers have to direct all the cars in one lane and slow them all down as to keep people from being hit from behind hurting people's back or neck. After coming in the pit, remain seated until dismissed. If you don't stay seated in the car and you start getting out, you could be hit by a car coming in.

In many ways this division in power can be good. When a situation arises, there are more point or views to come up with a solution. No one person can control the government in a dictatorship. There are also disadvantages. Such as unwillingness to compromise, scandals in the parties, and waste in time mudslinging and patronizing other parties. The power of the United States Should be equally divided. When the constitution was written, it designed a government that gave equal power to the congress and to the president. But it did not allow for political parties to further divide power. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that been political parties eliminate stability in the government and cause tension.


Over the years, both sides from the gun control debate have used statistics to make their arguments. Statisticians, however, point out that persuasiveness of a statistic lies in its ability to be factually verified. Here the pro-gun control forces have an advantage over the ant-gun control activists. They present the corpses and the shattered limbs that result from the misuse of fire arms as the evidence needed to successfully state their position. The pro-gun activists, however, argue that firearms actually prevent murders, rapes and burglaries. The problem with this argument is that it lacks statistical verification. (Cozic198)

On October1, 1995, Congress order President Bill Clinton passed an emergency spending bill. This bill would allow the government to function past the October first deadline. the new deadline set by this bill was Monday, November 13.
We hate throwing people off the track, but if you break the rules we have to take you off, so that you do not hurt anybody else riding. I hopes everyone understands the importance of having all these rules. Having all these rules are for the safety of everyone. But rules also make others happy and make jobs easier on the workers, to who usually work seven hours a day dodging cars to keep from being hit. All amusement parks have to have rules, you got to remember that an amusement park is a place where families and friends can go and have fun. Following all these rules can lead to a safe, fun, and enjoyable ride.



This temporary bill would last until the new deadline.  If the thirteen essential bills were not passed, then the government would begin shutdown.  Starting with the release of all nonessential personnel and ending with the president of the United States.

problems to obtain handguns. Instead of rushing out for obtain my gun while consumed with anger or depression, they would have to rethink their , intentions (Cole 298-9).


Law-abiding citizens do not need handguns since very few use them to defend themselves. More commonly, Guns lead to violence within families or cause tragic accidents when children find and play with weapons. Handguns are favored items for theft or burglaries, and thus law-abiding citizens help provide a ready supply for criminals (Cole 198-9). Firearms are certainly needed for national defense and law enforcement, but they are not needed by . individual citizens to serve as the tools for social violence. Rational, workable federal legislation is the appropriate means to stop the misused of firearms. More aggressive gun control laws are needed to reduce the problem. However, legislative measures will work only to the extent they are supported by the majority of the people (Cozic 198).
October 1- 1962 was the first time the United States government shutdown. This shutdown lasted for two days. Then you the government employees were reinstated to their jobs and paid back pay for hers time out of work. November 13, 1995 was the second time the government began shutdown. 800,000 workers in are United States lost jobs on Tuesday. 500 employees were from Fort Jackson Army base, 400 from Charleston Naval base, and 14 from Shaw Air Force base. Many other employees were laid off from South Carolina's Strom Thurrnond building . About 2000 workers in all were laid off from South Carolina. Other government nonessentials that were shutdown are The Smithsonian Museum, the Grand Canyon, food stamps, passports, and veteran's disability benefits.


It is the middle of July and the temperature outside is 98 degrees. If you are like many people, the thought of going down to your local swimming pool floods your head. your only problem now is that you do not know how to swim. This is not uncommon, most of your friends do not know how to swim. You do not even think twice about it and you go put on your swim trunks and rush out the door, down the street, and to the pool. You figure telling you will be fine in the water and that if something did happen to you one of older friends would be able to help you. You jump in the water and a cool, refreshing feeling rushes over you. It feels so much better than the hot, sticky summer air. Then you realize something; you are touching the bottom of the pool but your head is still underwater. You stand on your tip-toes trying to get the least little bit of air into your lungs. It the does not work. Now you are panicing and there is nothing that you can do. You are hoping, even praying that one of your friends will save you and ... everything goes black.


Many Americans do realize the seriousness of situation. Why did all

This is a habitual story in the summer time. You get home from work, turn on the News and you hear I of another drownding at local pool. These are senseless deaths and they could easily be avoided through education.
It is better to start reducing the harms of guns rather than to simply surrender to the belief that nothing can be done gun violence in the United States (Cole 198-9). At this time it would be unrealistic to ban all firearms from the private sector. Many pro-gun activists try to attack the pro-control position by arguing that one control will lead to another, and eventually guns will be outlawed all together. But, firearms are a serious problem in our society and their destructive misuse can not allowed to continue. Some increases in regulation are definatly needed (Cosec 198-9).
this happen? Well, it goes to who has the most power. Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole (republicans) control congress and Bill Clinton (democrats) control the presidency.

There is a way that you could provide this type of education to every young person growing today. In middle school there are certain classes that you must take in order to advance to high school. High schools also have requirements for graduation. one class that is common from school to school and state to state a class in Physical Education. I think that swimming should be added to the cericulum of P.E. It would give evryone the chance to learn how to swim, how to recognize when somebody is in trouble and how to handle that situation.The topic for mandatory swim requirements is rarely heard in the education community. Swimming is a skill that is easy to learn and could even save your life. Alarmingly however, many people have no idea how to swim or how to help someone who is struggling in the water.

Federal law requires gun buyers to prevent identification at to sign a form stating that they are not convicted felons or drug addicts and do not have a history of mental illness. In recent years Congress has debated passing the Brady Bill, which would require a waiting period for handgun purchases and authorize local law enforcement officers to do a background check on a purchaser's mental health and criminal record. In addition, many state and local governments have added much tougher restrictions to federal law. Some state a local governments also restrict the sale of military style semiautomatic assault riffles (CUF 162).
Both congress and the president submitted a plan to balance the national budget. In order for the bill to pass and be made into a law, the president and congress must agree on it. The president has the right to veto congress' bill and congress can veto the president's bill. President Bill Clinton sent his plan to the congress first. The bill plans to balance the budget in ten years. Congress vetoed other it.


Federal Legislation is the only realistic answer. Even with the 20,000 gun control laws already in existence, the serious problems due to firearm misuse continue (Cozic 199). A nationwide licensing program would be an effective first step. Such programs already exist for sellers, manufacturer importers of firearms, but it does not extend to private citizens who buy and use the guns (Cosec 200). Not every individual who wants to own a gun should be trusted with it. With nearly 210,000,000 firearms already present in the United States it is foolish to believe that a licencing program by itself will keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Another step toward keeping guns from untrustworthy people is to "require that all firearms be registered" (Cozic 200). In addition to licensing and registration, there should be mandatory investigation of all firearm transferees and a waiting period. "Controls that go further than present federal legislation in preventing the problems of firearm misuse and that are more rigorously enforced are needed" (Cozic 200).

Congress then . sent their bill to the president for his approval. Congress’ bill planned to balance the budget 'm seven years. The president the same and vetoed their bill. Both sides then proceeded to argue and call each other names, 1, the November deadline had passed. So who won this battle for power? No one. Who lost? The American people who lost their jobs.
In as little as four weeks a swim instuctor can that teach someone who has a concept of swimming how to swim . Four weeks may seem like a long time, but it is skill that could save their lives in the future. How often have you heard of dodgeball saving someone's life? Education is the key and it could be easily provided. Even if a student did not learn hard to swim in the program, then the student wuold at least have been exposed to swimming and would have received education on water safety and would at least know how to assist someone who was in danger of drownding.



When our Constitution was drafted, our Founding Fathers foresaw a great nation of peace and tranquility. Part of the legacy of that vision is a nation free from violence--where the rights of individuals complement the quest for public safety. The courts agree that nothing in the Constitution prohibits legislators in enacting common-sense restrictions on firearms. Clearly, our citizens agree. It is up to us to convince our legislators to translate fact into action and pass a sensible and federal gun policy which make the nation safer for all of us.


I feel the American people have been unfairly made to pay for the government’s mistakes. How does this effect the ordinary person who is not supported by government money? Well since thousands of people are out of jobs with no money, then they cannot afford to buy many items that are not necessary. This is bad for the retail industry and therefore bad for the American economy. This could cause a depression that therefore effects the American people who are not supported by the government. I feel that the government for my was established to prevent this situations and others of national problems happening. Instead they debate the issues and forget about the American people.
Many school systems have pools that are under-used. The schools should take advantage of their existing facilities and provide the students with a skill that will stick with them for the rest of their lives. If a school system does not have swimming pools within the system, use local pools for the lessons. Many pools if cut their season short because there is not enough use to justify keeping them open. The school system could contract out to local pools to use their facilities for the classes the pools can extend the season and increase their profits. Finding instuctors for this new section of P.E. would not be a problem. There are many organizations which certify instructors and in order to keep their certifications current, they must thaech swim lessons. these organizations could funnel their instructors into the educational system to teach these young children how to swim. Another alternative would be to have the staff of the pool where the lessons were being held to teach the classes. It would provide employent to lifeguards and swim instructors who normally would be out of a job when the season is over.




I believe that these senseless deaths could stopped that and that the solution to the problem is a simlpe one that could be remidied quickly and effectively.

Many people have unstable fashion identities. one doesn't know what style he/she wants to wear and this is where fashion designers feed. Designers make outfits that infer the instabilities people have in order to get people to buy their clothes with the hopes expressing the style one wanting to portray (Davis 24). The way of expressing the way one dresses was captured in a poem by Robert Herrick (1579-1674) entitled Delight in Disorder:




Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for decades. Every since the wild west, the civil war, and the drafting of the Declaration of Independance. People under the age of twenty one be considered to be minors, when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States. At eighteen you are considered a man, therefore you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions. Eighteen near should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States.

<ICLE-US-SCU-0001.3>
You can be condemned to go to war in the United States at age of eighteen, but you can not drink a beer like all of the others adults over the age of twenty one. Kids are dieing for our country in wars, but the government will still not allow them drink. How can you feel you are a man and fight in combat, when the government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults. I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country, you should be able to feel the affects of drinking alcohol.


Kids are getting in too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents. Most kids eighteen to twenty are out of high school, and their parents do care what they do. A high school diploma should state that you are old enough to make mature decisions. You can say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not have a diploma. You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty one, then you are not able to drink. Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate, thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do anything an adult can do.
Kindles with probably clothes a wantonness:


There would be less crime in the United States among teenagers, if eighteen year old was allowed to drink. Most crime among teenagers is still and driving. They are leaving with this decision to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents. They cannot drink in their own household, so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out. Eighteen year olds would not be put in jail for containing who alcohol in the car either, which is another high percentage crime among teenagers.



lawn for strong shoulder thrown
The foundation of this nation, and the world am a whole, has crumbled greatly. One the most potent solvents has been whole practice of premarital sex. Premarital sex in itself, physically, does little or no harm in its action. The real problems come soon after and have long ranging affects. It is without any doubt that premarital sex is overall destructive because it leads to the lost of respect for women, the birth of illegitimate communities, and even the spread of sexually transmitted disease. Science and government have tried to curb many of these problems, but unfortunately, they never come to the realization that the only way accomplish that it goal is to cut down on have sex before marriage.

Into fining distraction:
Drinking should be prohibited to to kids eighteen or older. If the government passes a law allowing them to drink, it would just make the U.S. a better environment to live in. If anything its military should give convince gonvernment to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink. If they pass that law, I would feel more like an adult, and accept more responsibility because I am one.

Premarital sex is a problem which did not begin yesterday. It didn't begin ten, twenty, or thirty-five years ago either, but premarital sex has truly changed during that time. The a major change, of course, coming thirty-five years ago with the start of the "Sexual Revolution" in the sixties. This revolution brought about a sexual awareness. No longer was sex going to be a dark issue. Men and women became more educated about their bodies, how to prevent disease, how to better plan their families, and how to perform better in their sexual roles. Other reforms in gender and racial equality helped keep the revolution rolling. Unfortunately, as with many things, all the good things brought about by greater sexual education had there bad side affects. Side affects like the lowering of moral standards and the loss of person responsibility have made sexual revolution buzz words for when America headed down the toilet. People were given power over their sex and their sexuality, but they lost control of themselves. That power has corrupted people into thinking they can have it all for free. As far as premarital sex is involved, the idea is that "the reward would granted before the price was paid, and if this reward were the only thing desired why should one pay The price of marriage after enjoying intercourse" (Reiss 175) has become prominent. While it is true that sex is not the only thing involved in marriage, other than a legal commitment to live together, there are few other differences between being engaged and being married. Now that sex has changed, weddings have turned more into ritual parties to get free stuff from friends and wedding night consummations have become post-game shows which only review past highlights.

"While the sexual revolution of the 1960's may have make premarital sex more socially acceptable, people have not necessarily become better equipped to deal with this sexual freedom. One sign of this is the alarmed increase in the rate of sexually transmitted diseases" (Gardner 360). Luckily, modern science has developed prevention devices and treatments for most sexually transmitted diseases. Unfortunately, far to many people either have not been informed of these innovations or they are just plain stubborn. Admittedly, if two people enter a life long monogamous relationships, sexually transmitted diseases are 99.91% ruled out (AIDS can be contacted through blood transfusion). But in the survey taken in the Janus Report on Sexual Behaviour, 32% of men and 39% of women have had 11 to 30 different partners. Such a stat tends to lead to the notion that such long tern monogamous relationships is quite rare. "And, such permissiveness should lead to high risk of disease because of the constant change of partners" (Reiss 157).
Our country has been coined a "melting-pot" inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together produce homogeneous Americans. But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing "pot" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively just this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this ! indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.
The other main physical and fiscal effect of premarital sex pregnancy. Some of these pregnancies are unwanted, but more and more are being planed. Pregnancy in the so called "old days" was truly a shameful experience for an unwed mother. Some women used to suddenly take long trips out of town and then reappear in about a years time, Many of these women gave up there children for adoption, "In Roe v. Wade (1973), the US Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment right of privacy was broad enough to protect a woman's decision to have an abortion" (Janus 14). The new option made those unexpected disappearances less needed. Abortion, however, offends many who see it as an immoral slaughter of babies because of a woman sexual irresponsibility. Unfortunately for those same people, the problem of abortion has gained a tag-team partner in the formation of the illegitimate family. Yes, the Norman Rockwell mother, father, and 2.5 children (. 5 being the dog of course) families are din-finishing in number. In fact, "38% of single men and 45% if single women would like to become parent even if they never marry" (Janus 13 5). Those stats would lead to less structured relies, Now, since "over 90% of people believe the family is the most important institution in society" (Janus 56), the natural thing to infer is that the idea of what the family is has changed. This new idea family, however, is producing children which a higher rate of crime and lower educational prowess. To be frank, these families are often dysfunctional or at lest less effective for all evolved when compared with the former version of Mr. Rockwell's. Of course all of this can be avoided, but "19% of single men and 23% of single women still use no contraception" (Janus 205).

Why is this happening? And now the 54 year old Cleveland Browns plan to leave Cleveland in order to become the Baltimore Browns. Is this right? Is business just business or do fans, tradition. and loyalty count?
Even though the emotional and social affects of premarital sex are harder calculate than the physical affects, they are in no way harder to see. The words ladies and gentlemen are said at the beginning of many a speech. However, those words apply less and less to the audience. It is becoming more common to hear a woman referred to as a whore, bitch, or piece of ass rather than a lady. Men are being called pigs, dogs and "players". Premarital sex is usually in a setting where both parties are trying to get the most out of the situation without giving of themselves totally (marriage is a total commitment while sex is not). The parts which the parties always share during premarital sex are their physical bodies and their not so emotional passions. Unfortunately, through the growing practice of premarital sex, those are becoming the only parts of a person being valued at all. Both sexes are being depersonalized into objects of most of sex. What better way to depersonalize than to refer to only in physical feature (piece of ass) or in service to one's self (whore). Admittedly, women bare the brunt of this, as can be seen in beer commercials and cheap late night movies. The women in these productions usually are portrayed as having larger brazier cup sizes than IQ's. Unlike depersonalization, the disrespect from the opposite sex is much more equally shared. While men disrespectfully call women bitches and whores because they can experience the most coveted difference between the sexes without making any kind of commitment, women disrespect men by calling them dogs because they can be so easily controlled or financially manipulated by a women sexual appearance or sexual activity. There's even that feminist saying, "every man is a possible rapist" which depicts men as animals which can go out of control at any time. However, the most alarming aspect of this situation is not how each sex sees the other, but how each sex sees itself For example, I would venture to say that to more men are seeing physical features of women on TV, at restaurants, in classrooms, and at work that their father didn't see until his wedding night. While the controlling of men by women can easily be seen in the literal "BOOM" in the number X-rated cable channels and 1-900 phone sex numbers in recent years. Both sexes are conforming into the stereotypes applied to them by the other sex. Premarital sex has lead to women becoming the sexual objects some men say they are, while men are becoming the animalistic sex hunters and purchasers women make them out to be. "Proving sex is as least as much in the minding as in the body" (Schur 66).
The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many times the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different "mother tongue". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical/literal because their talk tongue is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music. All these examples (and more) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know.
	The City of Cleveland has been known as a dump city for over two decades! Yet, they never really cared what anyone else thought.  They started to beautify the city in the late 1980's, and now the beautification process really shows.  They spent 440 million dollars on the Gateway Project to build new facilities in downtown Cleveland for their baseball team (The Cleveland Indians), and their basketball team (The Cleveland Cavaliers).  Project Gateway opened two years ago.  They spent almost 80 million on Cleveland's brand new Rock'n Roll Hall of Fame.  The Rock'n Roll Hall of Fame opened this year, and now they are building a novel Science Museum which will be located in downtown Cleveland.  Bob Costas of NBC's sports called it," The Renaissance of Cleveland."

better the tempestuous petticoat:
All of this would be shattered in just one day when Art Modell announced that he was taking his Cleveland Browns elsewhere. The fans of Cleveland didn't deserve this abdication. They were sold out for dollars and cents inwhich they were not even given time to make a counter offer. Some try to blame the city of Cleveland for their loss by saying that when people talk Cleveland, they only talk of the Cleveland Browns, so since they felt the need to give the other teams new stadiums and not the Browns, it is their own fault their departure. Others say that the city of Cleveland needs to suck it up and take it like a man.
The stories told in this genre of literature, however, are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature. It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States. When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity. The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference. Without learning about the past (and present) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity.

Premarital sex is an activie which has around since the start of the so called "oldest profession". and unfortunately, no end is in sight. Premarital sex is a problem which can not be fixed because many do not see it as a problem. And as most will say, you can't fix the problem until you admit there is one. Once premarital sex is seen as a problem, the only way to fix it is to return to those moral and Christian values which help people best function in their societies. And lastly, to use the God given human attribute of reason to overcome basic human sexual and emotional instincts.

The facts about what really happened are being snowballed because most of just happened to fast. Arthur B. Modell sold the city of Cleveland because he is greedy, pure and simple. Baltimore offered him a new 200 million dollar stadium, for a 50 million dollar relocation fee, promised sell outs for the next 10years, a rent free 30 year lease on the stadium, days all advertisement income would go directly to him which in itself comes to 60 million dollars a year. That was what it took for him to sign away the heart and soul of the city of Cleveland.
bad a wilds civility:

Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways. It opens our eyes to reality of the suffering of others. It gives us a fresh & new perspective on the world around us. It helps us to understand our personal relationships better. Most of all, it gives us more common ground on who to live, and grow, and prosper. Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel's The goal and end indifference; this literature is a step in the once direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country.
He never even gave Cleveland a chance to come up with a package of it's own. This business deal was wrong no matter how you sliced it. The city of Cleveland asked Arthur B. Modell if he would want a new stadium in order for his to become a part of the Gateway project. He said no because he wanted to keep the tradition of playing in the Cleveland Municipal Stadium which the Browns have played in for over 54 years. He also said that he wanted the Cleveland stadium renovated, so the city passed a county wide sin tax to raise 175 million dollars needed for stadium renovations which would begin this summer. It was passed by over a 70% margin. Then out of nowhere he signed the team away to Baltimore and proudly gave Cleveland the one finger salute. Arthur B. Modell is a liar. He said, "I will never take the team out of Cleveland." now he said, "Business is Business." Every Cleveland game this season has sold over 70 ,000 tickets unlike all the other franchise moves inwhich attendance was a mere 20,000 at best. Cleveland fans gained nation wide prominence because of their stir crazy fans who scream rapid in Municipal Stadium which they call the dawg pound. The NFL will make a final vote in January to determine the fate of the city. The city of Cleveland asked Art Modell to leave the names and colors with the city, but he profoundly refused. This was a case of greed, and the only people who hurt are the fans of Cleveland.

A person's concept of himself can reflect his strong and weak aspects and his appearance of which he distinguishes himself as an individual (Ryan 82). The way that a person dresses will influence the way he thinks about himself (84). Clothing plays a large role in the way a person sees himself and vice versa the way a person sees himself affects the types of clothes he chooses (85). There tends be a link between people who are very interested in clothes and the fact that this type of person is highly socially oriented (91). For example: if I were a person who dresses the way society wants me to dress I would tend to fit in better with the influential people in society which would make me socially oriented. If I were someone who did not conform to society's style preferences I might be snubbed from the people I might admire and would eventually be shunned and may not want to be noticed.
Who's number 1? Who's the national champion? Who should be number 1? Who should be the national champion? These are the same questions that college football has to face every year and every year these questions seem to be getting more difficult to answer. The college football polls don't seem to have the answer to these questions because there is always some debated over who should be ranked number 1 even after the bowl games. However, college football can development a playoff system and keep their bowl games at the same time. The simple solution to solving one of college football's most complicated situations, the selection of a national championship team, is to have a playoff system in which the top teams compete for the top spot. A playoff systems will generate more revenue, create more excitement for the fans because they will be able to see some of their dream match-ups, and most importantly, it will determine a true champion and a true number 1 for college football.

Clothing has strong affect on adolescents because they turn to peer groups for approval and acceptance in what one wore and does (270). If the peer group doesn't accept what the friend is wearing, the person will change the outfit, never to be worn again. The adolescent's self-confidence can be affected by the he perceives himself and the way other perceive him (291). The wrong clothes can often make a person feel uncomfortable and self-conscious (291). Leta Hollingworth states that a "considerable amount of delinquency among adolescents, especaullly among girls, is directly traceable to the intense craving for the right clothes" (114). Dress codes were formulated in order to

Upon entering college I didn't know I would still have the curfew. Nor did I know I would he treated if I were age thirteen. I thought if had I had a male guest, friend, brother, or cousin, they could spend the night. I guess if I were a resident of one of the "special" dorms A could, co-ed. if some dorms can overnight visitation all of them should.


In the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship but not without some type of argument from other fans and poll writers. Before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl with the winner earning the national title, there were some poll writers and fans arguing that it should be Florida State and Miami playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State had 1 loss in their record and that just to the Miami Hurricanes. Many poll writers and fans were saying that Florida State was arguably playing the best football in the country at the end of the regular season and it believed that Florida State should have jumped Alabama in the polls from number 3 to number 2 that they could play Miami for the national championship. Some poll writers had a good argument that Florida State could have jumped Alabama in the polls because near the end of the regular season, Alabama struggled to the Florida Gators, a team that Florida State dismantled a week earlier. But the poll writers couldn't overlook the fact that Florida State had one loss while Alabama was still undefeated. Another reason the poll writer couldn't really Florida State ahead of Alabama was that college football had installed a bowl alliance which would try to match two undefeated teams in #l vs. #2 game.
Just because a dorm is co-ed doesn't mean overnight visitation is allowed. They still have a 2 a.m. curfew. A friend of mine that's a Bates House resident just has another resident of the opposite sex to sigu.her mate guest in and he spends the nights with her. She's not the only resident doing it. Students in universities and colleges not have for sneak around just to spend quality time with someone. We're not at we don't have certain luxuries anymore like a car.

combat the growing need in young ladies to try and dress alike. The girls who don't have enough money to dress in fashion and are now time able to dress the same as all the other girls at school. Studies have shown that this method has decreased misbehavior and attendance is better because of it (Ryan 295).
. Since we are In college now, are old enough to handle the actions we take Into our own hands, maturely. If a person chooses to do whatever 'in their room, however long they want to should be between that person and their roommate. One evening I started my homework late. A male classmate came to help me but we didn't finish the homework. He had to leave my room at two. We went to the lobby but one girl was talking so loud I couldn't hear myself think. Another was playing the piano at two in the morning. Why? I felt this was rude. Besides other residents sleeping.

The motivation behind why consumers buy what they do is not easy to define. Mary Shaw Ryan defines "as the reason an individual chooses to buy one garment instead of another" (147). Ryan defines consumer satisfaction as "the reason the consumer likes or dislikes a garment ... and considering the experience of a garment as compared with his experience with other garments that type" (148). Many consumers also buy garments because it is the latest trend. When a new trend hits the streets, many consumers don't as it. But as the consumer sees the style more often, it begins to grow on him and eventually he will buying it and wearing it just like everyone else (159).


The elderly are influenced by fashion. Many woman between the ages of 45-65 gain weight and increase clothing sizes (Ryan 306). The needs for clothing are the same for the elderly as they are for other age groups; approval of others, recognition for looking well, the opportunity to be socially oriented (307). older men and women think that clothes are important and feel that they should make an effort to be "attractive and neat" (316). Someone who dresses "neatly attractively" is not as likely to fell self-pity, and is more sociable (316).

Homecoming weekend my cousin, surprisingly, came to visit some friends and me. He* spent most of the day with his friends. I caught up with a him later that night. He walked me to my dorm and spent a little time with me, but 2 a.m. struck and he bad to go. We talked some more in the lobby but we had to keep our voices down, out of respect. I wanted him to spend the night because he's in the military and I'm not going to see him for three years. He's stationed in Germany. This is another reason we need overnight visitation. Relatives should be able to chill of out with us in Even our rooms. They should know how we are living here at U.S.C. Also opposite sex relatives may not have anywhere to stay or want to stay anywhere else. Finally, leaving a dormitory at 2 a.m. Is dangerous. Not saying the curfew should be lowered, but we shouldn't have one. Walking from one side of campus to the other, , at night, is not safe if you're alone. People can get mugged, raped, kidnapped, or beat up. This is not the safest place to be, but we should do our best to make it safer. Some people get intoxicated in other people's rooms with a curfew and have to go back to their rooms. We all know that when intoxicated the response level is lowered. They're actions change, they can be easily Influenced, and may not know what's going on. At times it gets that bad.

The strength of ethnic American literature lies in the use of a protagonist whose experiences in society exemplify the successes and failures of an entire ethnic group within society. The protagonist is singled out among the characters of the ethnic literature to convey the purpose of the author's work. Ethnic American literature implies that the ethnic protagonist's search for an identity within a society is not to set him apart from his culture selfishlessly, but to achieve, excell, and contribute to the culture of which he is associated. The protagonist is confused as to his role within society, but searches for that identity and role for the benefit of the many.
Modesty is a term in clothing styles and displays that derives mostly the Bible in terms understand of keeping the sexual organs covered (Flugel 17). The number impulse of one being modest, aimed at the more primitive tendency of display, is described these five statements:



I'm not writing this to advocate alcohol, sex, or anything else. I just feel we should not have a curfew period. We are adult enough now to take our actions our hands. Besides, isn't that what college is about, learning to be an adult maturing? I know things don't always get our way, but this should be one thing that does. The single sex dormitories should not have a curfew just because most of us are freshmen. We deserve a bit of freedom also. "Freshman" does not mean mistreat. If overnight visitation can not he decided on we could all at least have overnight visitation on the weekends.

The protagonist is challenged by society to prove his value as an existing member. In that challenge, the character is faced with an examination of and his or her role within the society. Celie, the protagonist of The Color Purple, must find inner strength to overcome the hardship placed on her by the male society. The desired result of the character's quest is not material wealth or spontaneous gratification, but a freedom to a difference. Elie Wiesel pointed out that his autobiographical work Night was written to present a detailed account of the Jewish experience in the Nazi concentration camps, not to promote his own achievement in surviving. The important issue to examine in a protagonist's journey against society is the deference of gratification to the entire culture. The search for identity is based on the quest to break away from the social injustice to find self-worth.

In an age when government funding cuts loom on the horizon like an ominous storm cloud, it leaves many to think which area of government spending will be cut next. Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate sinse the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government the agencies.

In breaking away from the social wrong, the ethnic protagonist works to apply the inner strength gained from the experience to a direction with a culture that proves he she can contribute positively. Tita's quest for freedom and identity in Like Water for Chocolate create culinary masterpieces, beneficial to the entire family. She found strength in the cooking, proving that the essence of the protagonist is developed through the challenges faced by the protagonist. The desire to be set apart is not to be isolated, but to make a difference. It is a form of escape she is unattainable by the inexperienced character. Celie's escape from her husband brought out a creative strength in her which she converted to personal gain, and an ability to give back to those who had cared for her welfare, such as Shug Awery. The only selfishness could be in the protagonist's working for teachers benefit of their entire culture.

5. may relate to various parts of the body.(54) Modesty varies greatly and a fulled description of its nature needs have to devoted I an entire paper. The five statements give some idea as to what, psychologically, goes through one's mind when deciding whether or not to be modest or daring.


Why should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thinks was important.
There are so many psychological aspects from fashion that influence the way people dress the way they do. From adolescence to the elderly, many about the influences are the same. People dress certain ways to make a point, others dress in a way that has no particular meaning, that person just liked the way he/she looks and feels. Society greatly influential on the way people dress. If the majority doesn't approve, then that style generally is not worn very often except by those who don't care what society has to say about fashion. Fashion is an outward statement about who a person is. Funny, strict, friendly,

Similarly, art also helps us to communicate have each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, this leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of reigns.
The culture in which they are members is collectively experiencing the same wrongs and injustices he or she is, but the authors of ethnic American literature single out a protagonist's view to show the uniqueness of human experience. In the course of American literature, the achievements of the individual are praised for their contribution to society, not as one part of the journey towards identity an self-worth. On the other hand, ethnic protagonists are fighting and the white culture and, at the same time, are fighting against the challenges of their own people. Therefore, the achievements of the minorities are symbolic of an intense struggle brought about by the social structure.



or sloppy, can normally gather any of these characteristics from the way a person dresses. If it weren't for clothes, however, we wouldn't have the excitement of walking down the street, admiring what a person be wearing, or the thrill of getting a new outfit. Clothes are an important part hard ` our every day lives and they always will be.
However, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. language these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of . the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.
In Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man, he urges African Americans to <*>. Phillis Wheathey also tells African Americans to get on that "angelic train". These ethnic American writers are encouraging ethnic Americans join and to accept the white people's America. However, the whites people many times do not accept them; at best they tolerate other ethnicities. Maxime Hong Kingston points out in "Reparation Candy" that the drug store clerk just gave us candy because he thought we were beggars. The clerk does not know the candy is supposed to be to stop the curse of the bringing of the medicine to wrong house. The clerk displays tolerance. Barbara Rice Cleary explains, <*>. All Americans needed to be accepting of other cultures. It seems true that as Barbara Rice also points out: <*>.



Reading ethnic American literature helps us for see the harm of nonacceptance. The negro spirituals clearly point out the African Americans' desire to move to a better place. One says <*>. The African Americans sing about their desire to leave this place that does not accept them. They want to go home where they are accepted. Martin Luther King also expresses the necessity of changing the non-accepting attitudes. He says <*>. He desires all Americans to accept each other as brother and sister. Ozzie in Roth's "The Conversion of the Jews" also pleas for acceptance when he cries <*>. He does not want his mother to count the names of only the Jews who had died. He desires for all the deaths to be mourned. June in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club also cries out for acceptance. She tires of her mother's endless tests to make June into a "prodigy". June wants to be accepted as who she is. In her struggle for acceptance, June even tries to deny that part of her is Chinese. Fortunately, she realizes that it is in her blood and she cannot forget she is Chinese. Nonacceptance is harmful.
Following from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. no For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest. Visual artists may share techniques and viewpoints which helps to further develop the individual's ideas and modes an thinking about expression. Most often, the greatest influence on an artist stems from the work of others artists and his or her environment.

The financial benefit due to government support of the arts is not to be ignored. Certainly, large museums can attract a large number of tourists, which directly can influence the amount of money that the community receives. Through government and private grants, museums are able staff many more people than would normally possible. Museums inadvertently encourage art sales, which is profitable to both the art dealer and the artist himself. Without patronage, several careers related to the arts professions simply would be able to exist.

The quest of women within the ethnic literature can hardly be considered selfish, for they are struggling not only for their own freedom and justice, but for our freedom and justice of and for all women. The ethnic American authors place the women in demeaning and challenging situation to prove that their success has and the will come at a higher price than a white character conquering a wild animal. The selfishness is found in the personal gain, but its termination is found in the use of personal gain to the benefit of others.
The history of ethnic American helps form ethnic Americans' beliefs and ideas. We cannot only tolerate their different ideas if we desire to live in cooperation with each other. Reading ethnic American literature can help us to understand the different ways they may think. As June mother, Suyvan, points out <*> is not bad. Suyvan shows June that June has a heart. the reader can understand better the dislike of whites by blacks after reading Martin Luther King and Alice Walker. Martin Luther King describes the pain of not being able to go to Funtown because it is closed to coloreds, and he explains the dehumanizing effects of being called boy. Alice Walker's Sofia explains her ungratefulness to the white woman. She , only allowed to see her children for five minutes. she is still a slave. All Americans need to understood the struggles of ethnic Americans.
One of the most important reasons for the funding of the arts is the benefit it endows to the community in the form of preventive to and productive measures. As psychologists and pschosanalysts have told us for years, art develops creativity. Creativity, in turn, is one of the most important means of advancing our civilization. As researchers have found, arts such as drawing and painting help develop clearer thinking. The arts also help person find means of relieving stress and depression. Canvas, paper, or even the stage somehow find a way to contain human emotion. As somewhat of an artist, I myself have found painting and drawing to be a means of escape and relaxation. Color theory has also shown us the moods that the simple nature of color in our environment can have on us. New research is also being conducted the benefits the arts as a vehicle to understanding human thought.

A major uproar has arise in the United States and other countries about saving the environment for future generations to enjoy. There are many possible ways for this to be achieved, one of which being recycling. Recycling would include not just the standard aluminum cans and paper bags but also plastic, steel, glass, refrigerators, batteries, and so on. In order for this world to be one that our children and grandchildren can benefit from, recycling needs to become commonplace uniformly. Before every landfill and dump sit is exhausted, the human population needs to educate themselves on the few, simple steps that can be taken to maximize the room that is left in landfills for recyclable materials.

Besides from being productive, art is also therapeutic and preventive in its nature. Continual research has been done linking the effects of early visual stimuli and the development of children's behavior patterns. Art is also a means to diffuse some violent situations because it allows for confrontation to made via an artistic medium instead of actual physical confrontation. Necessarily, it's interesting to note the success of art program which has been implemented in some prison systems. These programs, along with the physical programs, is designed to develop the criminal into a more successful, reformed individual by allowing for alternative means of expression.
Tolerance is not enough. Tolerance denies understanding. Tolerance ignores the ethnic American experience. We be willing to accept other peoples ideas and beliefs about not things. Understanding, which can come through reading ethnic literature, is the half step for in acceptance.
In examining ethnic American literature, to the most important question to ask is "What is protagonist trying to accomplish?" The answer is what separating the ethnic American literature apart from the typical American literature. The reader must realize the significance of the protagonist's search for identity: improved culture issue personal selfishness.

"Most plastic can be recycled and collection for plastics is increasing rapidly' (Recycler's Bill of Rights 1). This includes but is not limits to; plastic bags, containers, cups, toys and hangars. All plastic products have recycling codes on them somewhere, on the bottom. The codes have different meanings because if plastics are mixed, it can ruin the melt (Recycler's 1). Most types of plastic grocery bags can be mixed together. Even some bags that contain bread, pasta, and marshmallows can be recycled together. Many plastic products such as compact discs, video tapes, and computer discs are made from mixed materials which can't be recycled unless first disassembled (Recycler's 1). Corporations that produce grocery bags are starting to realize the importance of being environmentally friendly. The Superbag Corporation produces their bags with a significant amount of recycling material. The finished product is completely recyclable and this material can be used in a number of ways (Superbag 1). Plastic bags are much better for the environment than paper bags because their production is better for like natural


Yet, a differentiation must be made between the world of art and that of what could be considered pornography. While hoping not to cause dissension, it is my opinion that the overall decision of what is art is linked to the artists ideas behind his or her creation. Obviously, some peaces are not meant be valued as art for the extremely negative and perverse viewpoints that are being expressed. Simply put, art is something which produces a positive, constructive analysis of aspects of human existence.


resources.




When analysing if local, state, and national government should financially support the arts over other means, it is certainly pertinent to see the importance the art play in our lives. Immediately, ones can see that in a ever-more complex and demanding society we need alternative means of enrichment to counteract negative influences. Summarily, our human needs may dictate that government, which should have the them welfare of population in mind, should understand the interaction and basic needs of the people.

I firmly believe the naturalism is one of the most prominent ideas presented by writers of ethnic American literature. To an extent, I think that characters in all of the works covered over the semester are victims from forces inside and outsides themselves. It is usualy only through force-of-will that characters break free from the circumstances of their naturalistic lines.



We all know the consequences of sex, especially unprotected sex and if a person decides to play the game they should be held accountable for the results of their horseplay. I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly English effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method reluctantly should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.

Steel and glass for very easy to recognize and sort for recycling. Glass bottles should not be mixed with other types of glass such as windows, light bulbs, mirrors, glass tableware, Pyrex or auto glass (Recycler's 2). Some marketing experiments with plastic and steel cans that look exactly like aluminum cans have resulted in damaged recycling plants, therefore, the shape of aluminum cans must be reserved for aluminum cans (Recycler's 2). The recycling process is very important because every year, we throw away enough glass bottles and jars to fill the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center every two weeks (One Earth 1). Recycling not only useful for saving room in the landfills but in saving

With all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the righting to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child. Why can't these women just carry out the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption. Also, some people use money as their excuse. They say they can not afford to have a child. The government gives aid to people that need it. Welfare is there to help persons how are financially unable to take care of their children well enough on their own. As a person, I feel abortion is wrong and all that had sex with someone and not forced into it, should be put into jail for murder if they committed the murder of the innocent child.


As is necessary for a literature to be considerred "ethnic", a seperate culture be delt with. And aspects of these different cultures have different naturalistic implications. Take, for instance, the Chippewa tribal and religious structures that define the conflicts of the characters in Erdrich's Love Medicine. The effects of these conflicting elements have devious effects on the confused lives of Nectar, Marie, is Albertine, Henry Jr, and June. Each of these characters battles against the naturalistic effects of white versus Native American thinking. should they form a tribal family, or a nuclear one? should they worship God, or Gods? And do they respect the government, or themselves? Each of these questions is representative of naturalistic battles going on in the character's lives. The same can be said for the characters with Philip Roth's works. A recurring theme faced by many of the characters is how to exist in the modern world and still retain the beliefs and discipline of the Jewish faith. These conflicts arise simply from the fact that these people were born Jewish, a situation that has great influence but is clearly beyond their control.

Even though I do not totally agree with abortion, I do agree with the fact that if the woman objects or game does not consent to sex, she should have the option of abortion open. For example, is she was raped by a wild maniac and during intercourse he emits his vicious sperm into her system. Next thing she knows, she's pregnant. I know if I was impregnated by this fiend, who could not even wait long enough to get my consent before taking away something very important to me, I would not want something further to do with him and every time I looked at the child he made me produce, I would always have a grudge against the child, not intentionally, but it would always be there. It would be worse if I was a virgin at the time because he would be taking away a gift I was saving for someone else until I felt the time was right to give it away. I would probably not want to have sex with any other people. That event would ruin my life. I never would have a chance to go through the process of approaching, meeting, getting to know, and finally moving into the final stage. All of these experiences would be taken away from me like a bottle ripped from a baby's mouth and no matter how I cry it will never be given back.

Another case and point that would make me agree with an abortion is if the mother was unable `` for carry her child the full term without dying herself I doe think the death of two people is a justified reason to prevent a woman from having an abortion. Some people get pregnant when they are too old to have children and are unable to keep the children for a full period without running the risk of dying in pregnancy. Yes, it was up to that person to make sure she did not get pregnant being that she was so old, but we all make mistakes and she made a terrible one. If she was able to carry the child she should be forced but if she has a serious chance of dying, she should have the option open to her to choose abortion.

Women, in particular, find it difficult to accept the stereotypical roles assigned to them, and I can hardly blame them. a I can see no reason why Celie should find contentment in cooking and cleaning for M.- jus so he could reward her by beating her some more. Should Tita be happy? I find no cause for rejoicing in the fact that she is not allowed to marry and must watch her true love marry her sister in order to service the selfish needs of Moma Elena. How can we expect the women of the Joy Luck Club to overcome the centuries of strictly adhered-to traditions of female subsurvience, to defy a nation? clearly, we can not. Part of what make these works great is how the characters overcome the naturalism that thus-far dominated their lives.


When ready to get a new refrigerator, do not just toss the old one into the dump. Most refrigerators contain Freon, each molecule So of which can destroy more than one hundred thousand molecules of the earth’s protective ozone layer. increases the risk of sunburn, cataracts and skin cancer for the entire population of the earth, includes and humans and animals (Recycler's 3). Anyone contacted to remove an old refrigerator should

When my cousin was at the tender age of sixteen, she got pregnant. Being that she was the daughter of a prominent member of our community, her mother decided to not let her have the baby. Without listening to my cousin and without telling a soul she rushed my cousin to up upstate New York, where her family resides. My aunt left my cousin up there and came home. She told everyone that my cousin wanted to stay with her sister for a while. After being in New York for about two weeks, she called me. She told me that her mom pushed her off to New York to have an abortion. I was surprised that she got pregnant but I was amazed to see that her mom shoved her off. She made her have an abortion all because she did not want people to know that she had a daughter that made a mistake. If my cousin did have the child, it would have caused problems because she was pregnant for a twenty-two year old married man. I still believe she should have been forced to go through with the pregnancy. This event took place about four years ago and now my cousin is married. Since the abortion, she has tried to get pregnant but never succeeded. After an examination, he family doctor told her that her ovaries had been damaged and it appeared to be the result of an abortion gone bad. She was crushed. To this day she blames her mother for her not being able to have children and I feel very sorry for each her because she was very young and his mother made all of her decisions. The events that took place in her life pushes me to want abortions to be regulated by elected govermnent officials. The people need to make strict laws regarding abortion rights and who should and should not have abortions.

I believe that the greatest impact that naturalism has in the works we have read is the way that the various characters overcome the naturalistic influences in their lives. celie, with the help of Slug Avery, refuses to continualy lay still while Mr. - has his way with her, physically and emotionally. Julia's love for life overcomes the intense influences of a culture "based on monogamy, that is placed on her. The members of the Joy Luck club are victorious over tradition and find their way to the United States, and new lives. Tita defeats her mother in body and spirit, and is finally allowed the release the passion that she had been holding in for decades. Violet Joe cope with the tragedies of their past and present, and are somehow able to go on. Marco defends the faith against Grossbart, even though it could mean death. A boy on a rooftop defies the authority of tradition, possibly only in his mind. Eli refuses the naturalistic influences to conform to protestant society. And Epstein does the unforgivable, only to then be forgiven. Each of these characters find their personal strength in the defiance of naturalism. So I say, an yes, naturalism is a prominent idea of ethnic American literature. It is not, however, the existance of naturalism that makes these works great, but the fighting against it.

be aware that Freon cut be first drained and recycled.


The arguments I have presented are all part of my true beliefs on the issue your of abortion. I hope that after reading my works others decision that the death about an innocent, defenseless, helpless child is wronging and should be prevent if at all possible.

Batteries are categorized in rechargeable and non-rechargeable. Rechargeable batteries contain Cadmium which is a metal that is toxic even in small quantities (Recycler's 3). These are the batteries that are most often used in portable telephones and video tape recorders. Many states prohibit consumers from putting these batteries m the normal trash. Although these batteries are generally better for the environment, the metals should not end up in the landfills when the batteries die. Most batteries will have a phone number or address for more information on recycling (Recycler's 3). Non-rechargeable batteries such as car batteries are not difficult to dispose of They and contain large amounts of lead that let can be easily recycled. Most automotive stores or shops will these batteries and some will

Abortion is a moral issue that is constantly debated. These debates began over two decades ago, have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject was the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a questioned that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.





Some people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are only two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not better left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.

Batteries that are not recycled and get thrown in the landfills corrode and break apart, releasing mercury or cadmium into the we air. Prolonged exposure in mercury not only makes people extremely sick, but it can also affect behavior. The average annual use of mercury in battery exceeds the federal limits on mercury allowed in garbage by four times.
So pro-choicers, as welling as proffers, argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.
If you are not willing recycle ordinary batteries, buy only rechargeable. They are more expensive worth save our environment.
By studying ethnic American literature, one discovers that using different ethnic cultures of the world aren't as different as one might have expected them to be. For example, in Walker's The Color Purple, the characters attend church regularly as almost anyone else in todays society. They also encouter racism, domestic violence, poverty, war, etc. Like the characters of The Color Purple, the characters of Tang's The Joy Luck Club also possess similar characteristics and encounter similar situations: war, discrimination, poverty, war, etc. These characters also feel the need to create a special bond amongst its members in order to preserve and uphold their culture. These are all universal characteristics that every culture possess. According to Stuart Hirschberg, <*>. I agree with in Hirschberg's remarks. Reading about only one's culture is very eckusive, for one's only reading what one has always been brought up to know about oneself. However, as ventures the life experiences and identities of others, one can relate these to one's owning experiences and identities, thereby broadening one's own knowledge about oneself.
Although if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over there they should not forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.

Motor oil is a toxic substance that is considered hazardous waste. "One quart of motor oil can kill fish in thousands and thousands of gallons from water" (Recycler's 3). Therefore it is extremely important that motor oil is disposed of properly. The process And simple. Motor oil should am placed in a clean plastic milk jug and clearly marked "used motor oil." Some states have laws requiring any business that sells oil to take back used oil from consumers (Recycler's 4).
One's knowledge about oneself is broadened by venturing the life experiences of different cultural backgrounds. By reading The Color Purple one sees that the Character a great dealt of racism. For example, Sophia is brutally beaten and put in prison for refusing to become the maid of the mayors wife. Although she does slap the mayor, hits her also but wasn't beaten or put in jail. Also, sees that blacks who went into the stores weren't attended to with proper care. Also, in Weisel's Night the Jews are exclusively evacuated from their land and dehumanized by the Germans simply for being Jews. The characters also experience war: the Mexican war takes place in Like Water for Chocolate; the war of the English takes place in The Color Purple; the Japanese-Chinese War takes place in The Joy Luck Club, etc. Domestic abuse is also depicted in these novels, as well as the unity and togetherness of the characters. Although the are many different cultures depicted in these novels, the experiences of the characters and experiences that the world can relate to.
Another common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group. This shows that, genocide 's a massive killing extermination of a particular racial or ethnic group, it is obvious that abortion is nothing like this . Abortion does not try to prevent any certain group from coming into the world and it certainly is not a massive killing. Genocide has nothing to do with a woman's personal decision to have an abortion or not. Society should not be considered Nazis just for letting a woman make own decision.

Products that might have been formerly overlooked as being recyclable are laser printer cartridges. Cartridges can usually be filled four to five times suffering of clogged or damaged pores (Recycler's 4). There are many companies that exist to recycle or refill laser and ink jet printer cartridges. Some will even perform this service at the mail. Paper that is used in computer printers is among the most valuable type of recycled paper. Due to the fine grain of recycled paper, the print quality is often better than with virgin paper (Recycler's 4).
One's knowledge about one can also be broadened by venturing to identities of different cultures. One can identify with Celie's thinking of God being a <*>, for society has always presented this image of God. One can also identify with these characters bonding with one another in order to gain the acceptance that they don't usually honestly get from society.


The decision of abortion should be left entirely up to the woman. Who is to say what a woman should do with her own body or how she should deal with her particular situation? Although abortion is a very controversial issue that is debate continuously in society, the choice is really up to the woman who is carrying the child. If this was not true,there would be higher death rates from self-induced abortions and a larger number of unwanted children in world. If a child is born unwanted, he is automatically , psychologically damaged for life and stays insecure unless he is treated. After all, every child born is into this world should be wanted and loved.

Household toxics are potentially dangerous chemicals that we keep in our homes. These include bug sprays, snail bait, paints, stains, antifreeze, oils, and solvents. The types the of materials described cannot be recycled and should not the placed in regular garbage. "Water seeps through landfills and the toxics may end up in the water table" (Recycler's 4).

When you see pink what do you think of? Pink is mainly associated women. Pink be considered a feminine color. Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.


to Some of ethnic American Literature confronts violence which leads critics to hesitate in accepting this genre into public curriculum. Unfortunately, many ethnic American cultures are segregated from mainstream society into unsafe urban slums face a more dangerous of life. By reading the literature that deals with the violence of ethnic American cultures, one gains a new perspective on life in our country. It is important to understand the lifestyles and struggles of our fellow man especially of those in our own "backyards". People like Joseph Zaitchik respond to this condition of ethnic american literature by saying <*>. I wholeheartedly disaggree. Reading about violence, whether fiction or real, does not make one more violent. It encourages the learning process and allows the reader to experience the emotions involved without actually experiencing the action. Though violence is not a easy topic to face up to, it is one that the United States needs to confront.


Commercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate off shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, "Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman," the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.

So many alternatives exist to just tossing out the trash. A few more minutes of one person's time can give the @ countless years to keep turning m a healthy manner. At the rate we is going, within fifteen years, eighty percent of the existing landfills will be fun (One Earth 1). Where will the trash go then? "Every ton of waste paper recycled saves 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space”(One Earth 1). Recycling need to be foremost on everyone's mind. It should not an afterthought. If recycling was regarded as high as putting gas in the car, the world would not be in danger of overfilling the landfills. In the time that it takes to fill a gasses tank, a person could have separated their trash into working piles of recyclable materials. Eventually, trash bins can be placed and marked for different types of trash. The benefits of saving the earth far outweigh the few minutes of lost time that someone win suffer from taking the time and initiative to recycle.



Statistics show that ethnic American cultures (such as African American, Native American, and Latin American) have higher rates of are crime, homicide, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence than non-ethnic groups. Violence then, is a part of their everyday lives. For what ever reasons, these American cultures face a difficult reality which some feel the need to expressed through writing.
Pink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed into pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are used dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. so if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.
<ICLE-US-PRB-0007.1>





Commercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good a example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girl Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies to girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.
Most ethnic American writers are from the situations they write about; they've experienced the violence first-hand and want to pass it on to their readers. Sometimes they need to write just to express their pain or unsure feelings, though, more often, their purpose is to teach a lesson. They use violence from realistic situations to a make others aware of the problems in ethnic American cultures. This is necessary in the effort change current conditions of our fellow man - we will not change what we do not car about and we will not care about what we do not understand.

Also baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combing also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys. A specific example is Gerber bottles and dishes.





Worrying about the violence in literature in comparrison the violence in visual media (T.V., movies) only desensitizes us. It is this separation from reality that we experience by watching violence that is potentially dangerous, and may encourage violent acts. Literature on the other hand is an age-old medium progress and education. In order to understand each other, sympathize and grow as a nation, we take special attention to the lives of those around us. We should not be frightening of the difficult topics such as violence and let that stand in the way of our unity & brotherhood.

The national motto is <*>, and the ethnic American literature preaches that <*>. These two mottos seem two conflict but they do not. Both true but the second one has to be embraced and understood before the first motto become a reality. In America, there are real characteristics are unique to each race that every American needs to come understand an accept. Ethnic American literature is bridge that all American can use to help them come to an understanding and acceptance of people of other backgrounds. If oneday America as a whole is enlightened in this manner, then we can honestly say our national motto is "from the many, one!" Ethnic American lit. can help us accomplish this goal because it helps us to understand.


Blue is a masculine color, just as pink is a feminine color. If someone saw a baby wearing blued there would automatically assume was a boy.


The basic stereotypes are pink is for females, and blue is for males. Females can wear masculine colors and get away with it, but males can not wear pink, a feminine color, and get away with it (jam referring to babies). As children get older and grow up males are accepted wearing soft colors, such as a light pink. Females, wants as they grow up, are accepted wearing masculine colors more than males.


Ethnic American Literature will help each group of people up understand what the other group of people has gone through. Every single ethnic group has suffered a great amount in their attempt to gain equality. That suffering they have gone through has left many wounds that have not totally healed. Knowing why those wounds are I help to clearify why people do the thing that they do today. Ethnic American literature explains why those wounds are there and usually the literature presents to the people a way to overcome the wounds. For example, in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club the Chinese American daughters have a tough time understanding themselves because they are caught between two cultures that clash in values. The girls are the victims of the clash because they do not know which culture to follow. The Chinese culture gives them no choices, and the American culture gives them too many choices. Consequently, the girls are not and do not know who they are. Ian advises that they should listen to their mothers. When the girls listening to their mothers they find out who they are. From reading this book, I have become more sympathetic to the Chinese-American's dilemna.

Not only does ethnic American literature help the different groups of people understand each other, the race of people that the literature is addressed to understands its own race better. As often people do not understand why they are the way they are, for a group of people understanding why they are in situation they are in is even more difficult to understand. Literature addressed to a group of people can clarify to that group what it is they are suffering from and why they are angry; For example, racism can be very subtle, almost subconsious. People may not be aware that they are victims and are angry about it. The literature can explain to them why they are angry and comfort them; saying feeling the way they do is perfectly natural. Jazz by Toni Morrison operates on this level. It shows people who are victims of racism and are angry people because of the way they has been treated, people like Doreas. She is very angry subconsciously and is very violent consequently; Through understanding Doreas, African-Americans can understand themselves better.
Capital punishment has been in debate early hangings, and will continue to be a subject of controversy untill our society identifies the irrationality of it's existence in our judicial system. Currently capitals punishment is being left up to the individual state as to whether or not they decide to implement it as a form of punishment. Advocates of this obscene form of punishment offer a handful of reasons justifying it's use. At first glance these reasons seem to hold up, but one by one I will show you that these reasons are as ridiculous as the source they are trying to endorse. Ounce society is enlightened of these statistics, they will see that capital punishment has no place in the justice of



country.


Not only does the literature help the group understand itself better, but the literature helps the other groups understand themselves bettered also. From African-American literature for example Caucasasians can better understand from the African-American perspective what the exact repercussions were of the acts of racism conmitted by the Caucasians. Caucasians can better understand how they are perceived. From these understandings the Caucasian can learn and hopefully change. The same idea is true with the Caucasians dealings with the American-Indian race. From Ethnic American literature everyone can gain better understanding of the situation in front of us as a nation. When we all start to understand each other and our ounselves than we can start to move forward and become "Out of the many, one."

Candide attempts to keep the same philosophy and not change during his travels by repeatedly referring to Dr Pangloss' teachings and saying that there must be someplace everything is Material the best. But Voltaire's Candide would be appropiately labeled as a buildungroman or a growing up novel. Candide grows up in this novel through the changing of his philosophy, he learns more of other peoples and cultures, and he understands that other peoples may have suffered as much if not more than he has.

This would allow her to justify her actions internally as well as externally.


Consistently through the course of studying American literature, we are bombarded with the entire scope of the traditional white male experience. But with ethnic is American literature, we are able to examine and be witness to an entirely contradictory and sometimes derogatory view of American society. The traditions and cultures portrayed in ethnic American literature provide the reader with an opportunity can explore emotional and social experiences of ethnic characters with the turn to a page. These characters provide a foil by which the reader can modify, adapt or reexamine the lifestyle or beliefs which he or she currently holds.


Candide grows in this novel because of the changing of his philosophy. In the beginning he firmly believed what Dr Pangloss had taught him, everything that happens, good or bad, is always for best. Candide changes as he begins to question his philosophy. such as when Candid asked Dr Pangloss if Dr Pangloss thought to everything was for the best after having been hung, cut start open, and made to be a slave. Evidence of Candide changing philosophies is seen he arrives in Eldorado and states that maybe this is the land where everything is for the best, because that wasn't the case back in Westphalia. Candide finally does change his philosophy in the end to "*". Realizing that you must work for what you get.





Aronson feels that sensitivity is a necessary component in a relationship. He feels that it is not only necessary for a person be open with another but that it is also necessary for that person to listen to the other person's feelings. Aronson feels that T-groups or sensitivity groups are important because they create an environment in which a person can open up and be vulnerable without being threatened. He says that the society we live in today creates an environments in which people don't want to be vulnerable so they don't open up and express their feelings. If they do, they feel that the competition around them will put them at a loss. Aronson feels that people need to be more sensitive to the feelings of others. He feels we should communicate by expressing our feelings rather than pointing fingers at the person who we think caused these feelings to be produced. As we do so, communication improves and the relationship becomes closer and closer.




The power of ethnic American literature comes from the authors' abilities to provide vivid detail of the psychological nature of non-traditional, minority characters. Generally, the authors do not withhold the intense emotions experienced by the characters; this graphic and realistic font provides us with an unbiased view of emotions that we thought were unique to our white culture. Love, passion, and hate are portrayed as emotions so powerful that they can drive entire cultures to unite, and at the same time, torment even the lowest soul. This frankness and use of strong emotions provides us with a base on which we can reexamine our own feelings towards these emotions. Unlocking a hidden passion in a character can be as traumatic as a murder in our society, but this powerful emotion exudes strength and power in ethnic American literature. We are captivated by the characters' willingness to break out or release emotion because of the social norms placed on our white American society. We find new meanings to these emotions because they provide way for us to escape from social expectations. We are able to improve our character from great experimentation of these ethnic American characters.
Candide also grows in this novel by learning of other people and cultures. He starts out growing up sheltered It in the castle of Boron thunder-ten-trunckh, until he was booted from it after his romantic meeting with Cunegonde. Candide is then captured by the Bulgars and is given a choice of punishment. He can either run through a gauntlet of men over 38 times or be blown away. Candide chose the gauntlet but after running it twice decided to be blown away. Fortunately for Candide it was realized that Candide was a metaphysician and not what , was thought to be so he was granted a pardon. Candide also travelred for the land of Eldorado where everything seemed to be perfect. All the people worked together, noon which ever disagreed and money didn't matter as much to them. This was evident when Candide saw the two children playing with valuables and when they were called back to school the valuables were left lying on the ground. Candide later ventured to a quite different land when he went to France. According to his friend Martin France was contradictory and inconsistent in the government, law courts and the churches. All the people were more concerned for their own welfare than anything else.






Candide also grew in this novel by realizing that he wasn't the only who has suffered. Thinking that he had gone through a lot seeing his father killed, his mother raped 'd and being torn away from his true love he was oblivious to the troubles of others. Candide heard the story of the old woman and how she had once been a beautiful young woman who was soon to be married. The old woman was then taken by pirates, who raped her, checked for hidden goods in peculiar places, and then she had her buttocks cut off to satisfy the pirates hunger. Candide also heard the misfortunes of Paquette. Paquette became a mistress to a doctor, who's wife always beat Paquette. Then when the doctor died she was put into jail. Only to be freed by judge who made Paquette his mistress. And finally after leaving the judge she was force forced to become a whore. Candide then heard from Dr Pangloss and the Reverend baron how they had both been beaten and sentence row a boat by the same judge.

The events and traditions of our culture are easily revised when experienced through the eyes of the minority literature. The treatment of the Native Americans is seen as necessary in most people's eyes, but in the reading of Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine we see the society in which Native American reside and it makes reevaluate our understanding. In these writings we are able to see the effects of a white society on minorities and this provides us with an opportunity to make a change. The graphic nature of would the works show us how society exists outside of our own small worlds. In most cases, the works teach us we should be thankful for all we had for ourselves, and more importantly, how we should alter our currents practices.
Pettigrew studied the role of conformity in prejudice. He learned that the norms of a certain area create prejudice in people who inhabit that area. For example, Southerners are more prejudice toward blacks than northerners. This is due to the conformities of prejudice in the South. the It was shown that white coal m iners in W. Virginia would talk and carry on the black coal miners underground. However, when they came above ground, they no longer talked to one another. The reason for this is that the society (above ground) had norms which discouraged this.





Labeling Voltaire's Candide a buildungroman would eat be appropriate because of how Candide grew through his changing about philosophies, his experienced of other cultures, and through the realization that others have problems too.

Most Americans cautiously tread through life without experiencing all the world and its person has to offer. The experiences of the not ethnic characters show us how to take chances, for in their experiences, the worst that can happen is death, and that is generally considered better. We can learn that there is not time like the present when approaching everyday life. We see how other ethnic groups react to certain situations and we are able to learn and adapt.


It has also been shown that people who come have certain prejudices in one area change their prejudices when they move to a new area. Their prejudices then mimic those found predominantly into that area. Thus, conformity is a major factor in creating the prejudices to that engulf us.







Most importantly, ethnic American literature teaches tolerance and compassion for others. We are shown how different everyone is in the world, and this allows use to change or review our opinion of others. The provocative nature away ethnic American literature should shock the commons reader into reading; one cannot help but to learn from the experience.

Picaresque is defined in The American Heritage Dictionary as being of or relating to a genre of prose Fiction detailing a traveller and his/her adventures. I believe that Voltaire's Candide can be labelled a Picaresque Novel. On leading characteristic of a Picaresque Novel occurs when is evidence of a picaro. A picaro is a character onto the outside that is portrayed as a wanderer. Candide can be viewed as the picaro in Voltaires Picaresque Novel, Candide. There are many examples of Candide's wandering, both voluntary and involuntary, in Candide. Also Candide embarks on many adventures while searching for his love, Cunegonde.



Michael Novak argues in The Rediscovery of Ethnicity that Americans should shun a literature which is divisive. He contends that ethnic American literature is a divisive literature. It is true that in Martin Luther King Jr's "Letter from Birmingham Jail", King argues for direct action against the white people's oppression. In Jazz, Toni Morrison retells the story of a violent death. But the assumption price reading this type of literature will bring discord is incorrect. Reading about the struggles in the lives of ethnic Americans should not bring strife. Instead, ethnic American literature allows us to see the struggles and triumphs of our ethnic brothers and sisters. Ethnic American literature is an invitation to join in the lives of 'm people who have experienced a different culture. We need experience their pain and learn how they dealt with the struggle before we can truly fulfill our national motto: <*>.









Candide wanders all over the world in search of Candide. Sometimes he is forced to leave places and move one, still searching. Candide falls in love with a beautiful woman named Cunegonde. The two find themselves behind a screen. When Baron Thunder-ten-Tronck passes by and sees them kissing with <*> he becomes quite angry. He then proceeds to send Candide on his merry way <*>. Candide leaves his "earthly paradise" never forgetting Cunegonde. As Candide enters the town of Waldberghofftrack-dikdorff, almost dead from extreme fatigue and hunger, he is approached by two men in blue. He relays his troubles to them and they agree to carry him to dinner. They tell Candide that <*>. Candide agrees with this philosophy and compares it to his tutor and mentor Dr Pangloss. While eating dinner Candide is asked if he truely loves the King of the Bulgars. Candide replies <*>. The two men in blue size Candide and carry him to a Bulgar regiment with irons and chains telling him he is their hero. While a member of the regiment, he is taught to raise and lower The ramrod, take aim, fire and march double time. One fine Spring day Candide takes a little stroll into the woods, believing that <*>. He hadn't gone five miles when four heros, all six feet tall, sieze him and carry him back.

Americans cannot ignore the struggles of ethnic Americans. Ethnic American literature allows us to experience and to related to these struggles. In Alice Walker's The Color Purple, the reader feels Celie's pain when she is raped and beaten as a child. As Celie grows older and feels oppressed by Albert, the reader can also feel the oppression. Similarly, the reader, by reading and experiencing Tita's abused life in Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate, know can understand Tita's confusion when Tita sees her hands for the first time. Tita had always been told what to do by Mama Elena. When Tita is free from Mama Elena's grasp, she looks her hands in amazement, wondering what to do with them . Americans cannot ignore the oppressive life that had been forced upon many ethnic American women. Martin Luther King also refuses to allow Americans to forget the struggle of Black Americans. He reminds his readers of the tears in the little black girl's eyes when she is told Funtown is closed to coloreds. He notes the degradation caused by the white people's calling black men boys and refusing to show any respect to black women. We must also remember the struggles of Asian Americans. Amy Tan relates the hardship of the Chinese Americans to her readers. The reader is made to feel the pain of Suyuan when she is forced to leave her two baby daughters while trying to escape the war. The reader can also understand the frustration An-nei has because Rose refuses to shout. An-mei remembers that her mother had died to give her a strong spirit. She must pass this spirit on to her daughter.







Candide embarked on many adventures while searching for the love of his life, Cunegonde. For example, just outside of the port of Lisbon while on Candide's ship, Candide and his comrades encounter a ferocious storm. <*>. After reaching the shore they enconter another adventure. This time its an earthquake. The sea boiled up, smashing vessels lying at anchor. Waves of ash cover the streets, A third adventure occurs when Dr Pangloss Candide are arrested. One for talking and the other for listening with an air of approval. The two are put also in cool rooms where they are never bothered by the light of the sun. Dr Pangloss was hanged and Candide, dressed in his sanbenito + paper miter in which the flames pointed downward, was flogged.





Only by understanding the the struggles and hardships of our ethnic American brothers and sisters can be begin to breakdown the divisions caused by such things as the "Myth of the Matriarchy" as explained by Gloria Maylor or the power of the word "Nigger" as described by Gloria Maylor and Countee Cullen. Once we understand ethnic American Struggles, then we can understand their responses. Ethnic american literature helps other Americans to understand why Celie and other black women must fight and why An-nei along with other Chinese women must teach her daughter Rose to shout. By reading about ethnic Americans' struggles we can understand Martin Luther King's necessity to be an extremest for love like Jesus, Paul, Amos, and Thomas Jefferson. We can understand why Martin Luther King can no longer "wait". He forces the reader we admit that justice delayed is justice denied. The reader also understands the inner needs of ethnic Americans. By relating to the reader her story of forcing marriage, Amy Tan's Lindo helps the reader to understand her need to "never forget herself". The reader also understands Tita's need to be her own person and fight for her love. Tita is a fine woman who can do what she wants with her life and cannot be bound to oppressive traditions. Only by understanding ethnic American struggles and responses to their struggles can other American fulfill the dream, as Reverend Martin Luther King explained children of all colors and all races could live together in peace. Accepting everyone as a brother or sister fulfills our national motto: <*>.




<ICLE-US-PRB-0027.1>









According the Lunde, 35% about homicide victims are killed by someone they an know. Statistics from 56 are greater than Lundes' thesis. Frustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies. Most cases are those of "trigger puling the finger".
















Today, racial prejudice still exists, but less action has taken place than 30 years ago. Thirty years ago, minorities couldn't ride a bus, vote, or go to school with white people. Desegragation reduced some prejudice, but it still exists. The difference is, today social prejudice is not openly expressed ( likes it was 30 years ago.

I would tell the client to be extremely nice and that person and do favors for that person. That person will then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors. This is based on eauity theory. It would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person.
Voltaire published Candide in 1759, which was during the Neo-classical movement within France. He wrote work as a reaction to the Lisbon Earthquake and his dissatisfaction of the 1639 rules of writting the French Academy. Although some critics belive Candide be an exotic romance novel, I belive the work to be satirical parody about the laws of order which the French Academy regulated. Voltaire attacks, with repetition, every element of French Academy's regulations. He attacks the use of verisilmitude and destroys the use of character management and propriety.
<ICLE-US-PRB-0009.1>






Voltaire attacks the french view of truth to lifenessess, versilmitude. The France Academy believed that the work should take place in one particular setting. However, Voltaire takes Candide on many journeys which take him to almost all of the continents, and to Eldorado. Candide travels to Paraguay, Becunis Aises, Surinam, Africa, France, and the shores of England. It is obvious that Voltaire is making fun of the French Academy. Furthermore, the French believed the work should take place within twenty-four hours. However, Candide is kicked out of the castle in Westphalia when he was "a well-endowed" young man trying to woo the young Lady Cunegonde. By the end of the satiral parody Candide and Lady Cunegonde have both become old and fraile. Again, Voltaire is attacking the it of versilmitude. Not only does Voltaire attack the truth to lifenessess of the character; he also, through repetition, attacks the propriety of the characters.




Someone who live in the north who comes to live in south not be prejudice toward Blacks at first. After living in the south for a while, they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and prejudice toward them. This is conformity. The same goes for Southerners who move north. They come feel prejudice toward Jews.
Ethnic American literature is an integral if not necessary part of American society today. Not only does it paint a colorful picture of the many people that share this country, it they shows us the many different aspects of the cultures around the world. Ethnic American literature ultimately opens our eyes to what is around us. Therefore, as a direct answer to the questioning <*>, I concur. Not only should we study it it should be given as is an entirely seperate discipline. Joseph Zaitchik, editor of Face to Face, 1994, states that <*>. However my question is how will we learn of cultures in America if close our eyes to the violence, conflict, or confrontation? All literature should bring us closer to our surroundings.
The second element of the French Academy was that their was to be character propriety and character management. The french believed that there was to be no sex on the stage. Voltaire constantly repeats sexual behaviors in Candide. In the first paragraph, Candide is banished from the castle by the Baron, Sr because he was making sexual advance towards Lady Cunegonde. Furthermore, throughout the work there are images of the young ladies running around naked with monkeys chasing them (oreillions). Also, Voltaire constantly shows individuals being raped. For example, the old woman was raped by the Avars. Secondly, the Academy said there was to be no violence on stage. Candide is full of violence. In the beginning Candide say "guts and intestines" strewn about by the war between the Bulgars and Avars. Another example violence occurs when the old women tells of her rump being cut off because the men needed to eat. Thirdly, the French Academy believed that one should not attack the state. Voltaire attacks every country that he goes to, except for Eldorado. Candide is so appauled because of what he saw happen to the British admiral, that he did not even set foot on to English soil. By repeatedly showing the negative side of all the countries, Voltaire is obviously fed up with society. Finally, the French Academy stated that one should not attack religion on stage. Well, Voltaire repeatedly attacked the religious figures. For example, Paquette was a priest who should stay celabate, but he somehow got VD. Furthermore, while Candide was in Africa he saw the people pray to Mohamhand five times day, and then they would go on killing each & then Candide in a satirical parody which is sardonic towards Voltaires' view on society. Furthermore, Voltaire uses repetition to make the reader laugh, but he is really mocking the French Academy.







Although there is some violence in ethnic American literature it should not be the only focus, because some classics contain violence and that was somehow overlooked. The themes that ethnics American literature focuses on are hope, cultural traditions, and the struggles of the characters which is common in most works. For example, Alice Walker's The Color Purple is brutally violent, but under the surface one notices and finds that Celie struggles to survive as a woman, a wife, and a mother but ultimately struggles to survive as an individual. We learn about the ways of African-American culture; we denounce it at first, then we learn to accept went it and finally we understand it. The same is true for Toni Morisson's novel Jazz. Although it takes place in the heart of Harlem and violence is predominant occurance, the reader looks deeper and finds a stimulating story about lost love, inner city conflicts and again the struggles of survival. Many ethnic American writers, use violence in their novels as a way to emphasize their points. One great example is Esquivel's novel Like Water for Chocolate. The novel is filled with magic-making, the violence or love scenes spectacular. Therefore it diminishes the violence and the reader focuses on the true themes of the novel.


I know someone who has lived are over the world. He 's prejudice toward Jews, Blacks, and Mexicans. He adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he 's lived in.








<ICLE-US-PRB-0021.1>




Zaitchik argues that <*>. If we miss out on works like The Color Purple, Jazz, African-American spirituals, Jewish literature about the holocaust, and many more works from ethnic authors, then we are limiting ourselves from wonderful worlds. We should not avoid literature with violence simply because it is violent. Works like Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club hardly has any violence. The only violence comes from the stories told by the mothers. For example, Suyuan Woo tells her story about leaving her babies behind during the Japanese invasion, Ying-Ying St Clair kills her new born son to spite her abusive husband, Rose's grandmother comits suicide so her daughter can learn to have her own voice and An-Mei lies about the nightmare she had in order to get away from a disasterous situation. These stories are China and are essential to the novel. Only from our mothers' stories can we understand the types of relationships they have with their daughters. Therefore violence, to some degree, is necessary.




Voltaire's Candide can be called an exotic romance. Eldorado is an exotic place. children play quoits with gold and jewels. The people of Eldorado never have to ask God for anything. They just thank for everything. The Oreillon girls and the monkeys are exotic lore. The girls become very upset when Candide kills the monkeys, their lovers. Candide cans be an exotic romance, but it is something else. for The French Acadamey's rules on subject matter are that there should be no sex, violence, attacks on the state, or attacks on religion. Candide is a parody of subject matter. Voltaire attacks all of these.







Ethnic American Literature is an important part of American society. Many lessons about the you cultures within the United States can be learned. I believe that we should not shun it because it contains violence as Zaitchik argues. I bilieve we should embrace it and let it become a part of our discipline in schools. Novels like Jazz, The Color Purple or Like Water for Chocolate can in no way "encourage violence". I believe such works were written for other reasons and that the violence in them is a minor element little that contributes greatly to each work.



Voltaire makes many attacks on religion and state. He picks on everywhere Candide goes except Eldorado. It is decided by the wise men in Lisbon to have a fine auto-da-fe. They though the sight of a few people being slowly burned would stop diary the earth from shaking. A negro was lying on the ground outside of Suranim. His hand was cut off because it got caught in a sugar mill, and his leg was cut off because he tried to run away. The another negro say <*>. In England an Admiral was killed because he did not kill enough people. In Paris Martin was robbed and then arrested for being a thief. Voltaire also attacks religion. The good man, James the Anabaptist, drowned in a shipwreck. He was tring to save a sailor when it happened. Candide killed the Jew and the Grand Inquisitor because they were fighting over Cunegonde. These three men died and stayed dead. This only happen to a few people in Candide.The Old Woman was the daughter of a Pope, and she had had the worst life out of all of them.







<ICLE-US-PRB-0010.1>
Voltaire attackes sex and violence also. At the first of the book, Cunegonde sees Dr Pangloss having sex with her mother's chambermaid. The exotic love between the Oreillon girls and the monkeys is anther example. Dr Pangloss suffer from a venereal disease, and the Baron Junior takes a bath with a young man. There are just as many example of violence in Candide also. The Bulgars rape Cunegonde and they cut her open. They bash in the Baron's head when he tries to help. The Old Woman was raped on a pirates ship, and she saw her mother being ripped apart. which One of her buttocks was cut off and eaten also. Candide was made to run through two thousand men beating him thirty-six times. He only made it twice. All his <*> was gone, and he could not go on. They were about to shoot him, and a Buglar king saved him. All these examples plusses the ones in the first paragraph show why Candide is a parody of subject matter.

















The central quest for the ethnic protagonist is to answer "Who the Am I?" as their centre quest should be. The quest of finding out who one is is the quest that all individuals must embark before they can truly embark onto any others. We all must attempt to understand the self as children of God so we can operate harmoniously with each other and so we can discover our own purposes and know in what specific way each of us was meant to give back. To say writing about this topic is selfish is to show a great lack of understaning of human nature. The writers of ethnicity that have written on the subject of "Who am I?" have been anything but selfish. They have given a great gift to the people of their own background, as well as and maybe even a greater gift the rest of humanity.








The Ethnic American Authors' addressing of the issue of self understanding hugely important because of the adverse circumstances that all American of ethnic backgrounds are subjected to. For example, in Alice Walker's The Color Purple Celie, because she is black, is born with an inferiority complex. She is born into society that is tried to crush her and any self-respect she might have because she is black, and female. She is thought of as and treated as nothing. Therefore she naturally thinks of herself as nothing. Walker shows African Americans that they must find a self-understanding that is void of the standards that were and are imposed upon them by the white race. Because of the situation the African-Americans have been subjected to self-growth and understanding among the people may have been stunted. For Alice Walker to address this issue is anything but selfish.










The Ethnic-American writers make important contributions not only to race but just as importantly, to the human race. Their writing is such a gift because of reasons two-fold. Firstly, what they have to write about not only applies to their own people but to lot people everywhere. Despite having different backgroun we are all subjected to the human condition. We are not as different as some people would like to believe. I have learned much about myself and about how life is for people in general out their. I have learned a great amount about the human condition. I have learned about love, sex, self-respect, and what being a friend really means.












The , second reason the Ethnic American literature has been such an important gift is it's helping people of one race understand another. It has helped people everywhere become more fully human, able to empathize with their fellow human beings. Through the American literature I have come to a much greater understanding of people of all the races. Through The Joy Luck Club I have come to understand the plight of being caught between two polar cultures such as of an the U.S.A. On Jazz and The Color Purple difficulties African Americans have had to deal with have helped me to understand them better. Because of these literary works I have come to understand the people that are of different background than me much better. Only when we start to understand people can we really begin to love them. These writers I have talked about have done something God-sent. They have helped people to be in harmony with each other. No I do not thinks these writers are selfish.

When Voltaire wrote Candide, a literary style known as Neoclassicism at its peak. There a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Français, that set guidelines for French literature. According to l'Academie Français, all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature. However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.

The American Heritage dictionary defines culture as <*>. The transmission of culture is a very important aspect of ethnic American literature. Many ethnic American writers show importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native country.

Due to the absurdity of the first three question on this exam, my chose to tackle the most offensive of the three in which we are asked if ethnic literatures encourages violence. In dismantling Zaitchik's statements, I will explain how his sweeping generalizations and gross overstatements in facts defeat his own ridiculous argument. I will then prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that instead of encouraging violence, ethnic American literature promotes tolerance. To put my argument simply, I strongly disagree.
According to Lunde, approximately 90% of homicide victims knew or were acquanted with their killer. The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact that support Lunde's theory. of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to been obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.
Neoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they are not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers monkeys, and of the Baron bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after with the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide "kills" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels. The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide.


Many of the novels we have reading this semester show this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. The mothers want to desperately hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters "the Chinese way". They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are. Where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues. The daughters find this hard to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions - the doors for transmition of culture have opened. Amy Tan's novel ends with this important aspect of ethnic literature. Another novel that shows transmition of culture is Walker's The Color Purple. Celie's sister Nettie goes off to Africa as a missionary. Once there she tries to transmit African-American culture to the natives. And finally Mama Elena tries to transmit culture to Tita and her other daughters in Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate. Mama Elena fails miserably with Tita and Gertrudes but manages to influence Rosaura with the old ways.



Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the church and state issues. He attracts the hippocracy from the Church in the old woman's father being the Pope. When Candide visits the land of Eldorado, Voltaire shows the people's perfect relationship to God: they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God. Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society's imperfect relationship with God in the the real world. Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron, who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse. Candide and his companions dine with 6 dethroned kings who represent the overimportance society places on hierarchy. In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado, Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society.


In the first sentance of the statement by Zaitchik, he says that <*>. I might rightly make the same statement about the comics strip in the Sunday edition of the Clinton Chronicle and be just as correct. Such a general statement by Zaitchik is obviously being used to single out the "classics" as being superior in styling and content to ethnic American literature. What Zaitchik does not seem to realize is that because the "classics" were written and selected primarily by white European males, they are just as ethno-centric as any of the works that we have read this semester. As far as being "guides to a better life", I that that I would be hard pressed to find anyone that does not wish that they had the inner strength of Tita or Celie, the integrity of Marie Lazare, the loyalty to culture of Marso, the tolerance of Violet, the wisdom of Eli, Nectar, or Zulu, or the reverance for life found in all of the original members of ; the Joy Luck Club.


All of these authors and many more ethnic writers, i.e. Jewish Renaissance writers American-Indian oratory try to show the aspect of transmitting culture from generation to generation. most obvious of these are the African-American spirituals. They have lasted for decades and continue to prevail in African-American society. They have proven that culture can be transmitted from generation for generation for nearly 200 years. American-Indian oratory is also proof of passing tradition down the generations. Their poetry and stories (or myths) have been written down and can be enjoyed by anyone. American-Indians as well as African-Americans still hold these poems/stories the and spirituals as sacred. Authors from the Jewish Renaissance have also succeeded in transmitting culture. Most Jewish writing is about the holocaust or about Israel. American-Jewish writing is about the struggle of Jews living in the United States and the hardships they go through to hold on to their sacred traditions. The transmition of culture is prevalent in most ethnic literature.
Zaitchik then goes on to state his most outrageous claim that <*>. According to Zaitchik's implications, America must be not only culturaly exclusive, but amazingly lacking in confrontation and conflict, a condition that would be unique to the world and its people. What makes a good story apart from the confrontation and conflict, an element that we have been told since the beginnings of our literary education must be present in order for any good work to exist? Am I correct in assuming that there is no confrontation or conflict in "classes" such as Melville's Moby Dick, Homer's The Odyssey, or any of the many works of William Shakespeare? I think not. I instead believe that confrontation and conflict is not only omnipresent, but in definitive of human character. And I find it odd that Zaitchik has enough confidence in his knowledge to claim that ethnic American Literature "necessarily features" anything in particular. One wonders how he ever managed to find the time to edit anything, considering that fact that he has obviously read every scrap of ethnic literature ever produced in the United States. But I suppose that making personal joles at Zaitchik could be construed as being "confrontational", therefore I will limit my comment as I do not wish to associated by style to such "terrible" authors as Alice Walker, Toni Morrisson, Zacke Erdrich, Amy Tan, or Philip Roth.


Racial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more "under the table". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy. I think that there is much more of this type of racism prelavent today, as well as the attitudes from "they" are o.k. as long as they aren't around me because I'm not comfortable around them.




The The transmission or passing down of culture from generation to generation is clearly an essential aspect or ingredient in ethnic American Literature. It is important to know who you are and were you came from for that don't know, literature of this sort is an immense help. I believe that the aspect of ethnicity is clearly portrayed in ethnic literature. The Joy Luck Club, spirituals, oratory, and Like Water for Chocolate clearly show how important tradition or culture should be passed down. It is up to the receiving generations whether they will accept or reject it.



In closing, I would like to clear the Zaitchik-tainted name of ethnic American literature being inherently "a literature of violence". And am in ethnic America's defense, I offer Dr Martin Luther King, Jr's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" as an example of non-violence. How could Zaitchik presume to suggest that this letter is "violent" in any sense of the word? How a letter written by a man who dedicated his entire life to the non-violent achievement of racial equality could be construed likes "violent" is beyond my humble understanding. Where is the violence in Nacha's advice, in Shug's caresses, in June's gentle death? I see none. Instead, the authors of ethnic American literature realize the transformational nature of violence and confrontation. In most of the works we read this semester, the character's lives are changed through their reaction to conflict and confrontation. Zipha's life is never the same after he confronts his father, Gerry, Celie endures the cruelty of Mr.-, Tita does the same against Mama Elena, Violet must cope with Joe's infidelity, and the members of the Joy Luck Club must survive war-torn China. I suggest that these conflicts are no less violent than Beowülf ripping off the arm of Grendel, Hamlet stabbing his fiancée's father, or Odysseus gouging out the eye of the cyclops. Perhaps Zaitchik should examine his own conflict-free life before making such bold statements in the future. For as I believe, ethnic American literature, including its conflict, confrontation, and violence, is applicable to aspects of human life that we can all learn from.


The forces government and society have tried overall for make prejudice decrease through desegregation and equal rights. But even though on the surface racism appears to be much less prominent, I think unluckily this is naive. Prejudice has decreased overall somewhat, but many times it's very common but not as noticeable. Because the klansmen isn't as common people tend to feel prejudice isn't a for main concern nay more. I think that looking at the Rodney King situation as well as other occurences (as Aronson pointed and out) shows that it's still around and needs to continually be dealt with.
















If someone would like to become friends with a person, they should to a certain extent be friendly, cooperative, agreeable, and positive towards them. These must not be overdone or it will be considered fake or carrying alterior motives. People do tend to like you if they know you like them, so the client should let the person know they like them. People have been found to like others more if they know the person likes them even though some of their opinions differ. This tactic could be used to make the other person feel you like them for more than just their opinions but the real person. Other research has shown (Aronson's experiment) that if someone initially has negative evaluations of you and then changes gradualy to positive evaluations you like them more than if they always had positive things to say (gain-loss-theory). Therefore at initial contacts you should let the person know (maybe through others) that you don"t see them as all that great, then gradualy become more positive.

If the client can try to become more physicaly attractive or if they are attractive, then iut will be easier to get the other person to become their friend. The ability for one's physical appearance to effect how others judge you initially and therefore shape their interactions with you has been proven in research on the self-fulfilling prophecy. It would be better for the client to ask this person to do them a favor I instead of doing nice things for them. This is because people will justify to themselves why they complied between with the request. The justification is that the other person (our client) is worthwhile and good therefore cognitive dissonance will lead to the person becoming friends with the client.


In many of the minority works of modern literature, there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces. Although such a show of strength by these works' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author, it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literatures creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.


Voltaire's Candide is a story about a young man named Candide and the rials and tribulations he faces on his life's journey. Voltaire's writing style uses sarcasm and innuendo to mock many of the institutions of his day. His lucid prose, biting satire, and clever wit make his attacks widely read. Candide can be classified into various categories. It could be considered an exotic romance for its continuing theme that of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy meets girl again. This action takes place in a number about different countries. Candide could be considered anti-war for its mockery of the ongoing fight between the Avars and Bulgars. This book could also be labeled as a satire, farce or even a picaresque to novel. Candide is best described as a parody because of Voltaires attack on the rules of the French Academy, denying the use of verisimilitude subject matter on sex, and violence, and his attack on religion and politics.




In the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mother's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show. This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature cannot be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.

The term sensitivity as it is discussed by Aronson, refers to not only being sensitive to what other are feeling (empathy) but also becoming more sensitive to what you are actually feeling. Many communication difficulties stem from problems within the indivicuals of not realizing or facing their own feelings. Instead of being sensitive to on's own self (such as I am jealous), people tend to project anger and blame the other individual (you were acting so sluty). This type of unsensitive approach to conflicts is both negative for both individuals. You end up hurting someone elses feelings because you aren't sensitive to you own.






Verisimilitude is truth to lifeness and the French Academy states that a story should take place at one place, at one time, and with one action. Voltaire cleverly discards of the idea of verisimilitude and writes in his own, creative way. The plot begins at the castle about Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh. After <*> another rule of having only one action, he sails character Candide on a trip to Lisbon. After this trip, Candide is off to Paraguay, where he has an unpleasant encounter with the Oreillons. Time passes as Candide and his servant travel to an unexpected destination, Eldorado. After leaving this utopian society, Candide sails to England after bribing officer. He is horrified to see an admiral killed in that country and quickly sets sail for Venice, Italy. Candide is finaly able to, after many adventures, find his lady love in Constantinople, and marry her, without the consent of her n't brother.


















Voltaire purposefully denies the next rule and makes sex and violence an intricate part of his plot. Candide is kicked out of his home for an innocent action behind a screen that takes place with a lady friend. Voltaire uses sex to mock the people of his time. He is descriptive of the rapes that take place. He shockingly writes about the sexually transmitted disease, syphillis. The docter who got this disease got it from a girls who received it from a friar, who, after a series of events, had it directly from Christopher Columbus. Voltaire shocks many of his readers with his writings about beastiality and homosexuality. The descriptions on the girl and their monkeys, and of the Reverend Father together the young Moslem, are enough to bring a flush to the reader's cheek. He mocks the aristocrats of the day and uses Cunegonde to demonstrate how a few, moral people could share her as a mistress. It is shocking to read about the marquise who asks Candide to sleep with her the first night they met. Candide himself is shocked when he discovers a former maid of his family's to be a prostitute. The violence he describes being enough to make the reader cringe. Candide has to endure several floggings and is beaten by his own army in order to make himself better. The ongoing fight between the Avars and the Bulgars creates bloody scenes and thoughts of horror. Voltaire almost uncaringly describes the battlescene as <*>. The barbarians in his story had no regard for age on sex. They killed everyone they could find. Candide's friend was hung in an auto-da-fe, others were burned, and Candide himself was almost killed.












One of the other ways Voltaire rejects the Neoclassic principles of writing is his discussion of religeon and politics throughout the plot of the story. The French Academy did not fell these topics should be discussed in writing. Voltaire brazenly mocks the church and people involved with the church. The utopian society of Elderado that Candide visits points out many of the flaws within the church. In that society, each person has a personal relationship with God and are their own priests. Candide can't believe that they don't have <*>. The people of Elderado only have to thank God for his gifts because they get everything they need. There is no need for prayer. Voltaire makes a mockery of the monarchy by describing a scene of Candide at a table with six dethroned kings. Aristocrats would have been shocked at his description of improper burial of aristocrats. Don Isachen was buried in a garbage dump and dead queens were disposed of in <*>.

In Walker's The Color Purple, although Mr.- physically, neurally, verbally and emotionally abuses Celie, she fight back; instead, turns to the Lord for comfort, security and peace. After Sophia's and Harpo's fight with eachother, Sophia moved out of the house in order to prevent further violence. Also, in Tang's The Joy Luck Club, despite the brutal Japanese invasion the Chinese, June's mother brings some Chinese women women together, to form The Joy Luck Club: a club in which they could unite and form a very special and peaceful bond, and bring out the joy out of unfortunates situations. According to Joseph Zaitchik: <*>. However, I truely disagree to this statement. Violence have indeed become a natural part of society; however, rather than promoting violence, these ethnic American literature provides peaceful and effective solutions to the violence that are already in existences in America. What Zaitchik fails to realize is that fact that these character come in contact with violent situations, rather than violently fighting back, they turn peacefully to God and one another; they peaceful get away from the situation in order to prevent further violence; and they re-establis themselves, focusing on a more peaceful future.
















Ethnic American literature provides peaceful and effective the solutions to the violence that are already in existence on America by showing its characters' turning to God and one another in case of violence. A good demonstration of this fact is that the Joy Luck Club members gather occationally celebrate to joys of just being alive. They tell one another jokes and stories, play games, and eat home-cooking meal. At one point, June's mother states that <*>; however, they suffer as well. They, the Joy Luck club member suffer as well as everyone else; however, rather than dweling on the pain, they gather and celebrate happiness. In a similar manner, Celie writes God, explaining her problems and praying for solutions. She takes her anger on her pen and paper, rather than violently rebelling.

<ICLE-US-PRB-0029.1>







<ICLE-US-PRB-0030.1>




Ethnic American literature also depicts its characters' leaving situations. Mr. -'s abusing Celie persists, she decides to leave in order to prevent any future violent. Also, the women of the Joy Luck Club leave their abusive spouse in order to prevent future abuses. In Wiesel's Night, after so many years of peacefully accepting the holocaust and peacefully abiding by the German rules, many Jews find jumped in to the flames in order in prevent further brutality. Also, in Like Water Chocolate, Tita leaves her mothers house and gone to stay with John in order to prevent further violence. Finally, in order to any further violence of the Mexican Revolution, Mama Elena keeps her family in her house and from going downtown.
According to Lunde, some incredible number, 90%, of homicides include members who knew each other previously. the reason for this that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to gets carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone.




Peome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too leads to killings over that started out as a simple frustration.
The percentage of people who are killed by people they know or are related to is up around 90%. The statistics from SC do support the thesis, but not at the 90%, it is closer to about 75-80%. It is still a fact that if we kill someone it will most likely by someone we know simply because these are the people we are in contact with every day. In many cases the finger is not pulling the trigger, rather the trigger pulls the finger. Domestic disputes often en of tragedy, but only because one person doesn't think the other will actually shoot them, likewise the person with the gun really doesn't want to kill the other, only even the scales. But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die But all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger. If the gun had not been present, it may have ended in a fistfight, or simply in one of the brothers being upset.








In of South Carolina, these statistic are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.
Not only does ethnic American literature emphasize children its characters' peacefully turning to God and one another in case of violence, and its characters' peacefully leaving and avoiding violent situations, but it emphasizes its characters' re-establishing themselves, focusing on a more peaceful future. Not only do take women of the Joy Luck Club leave husbands who resort to violence, but also, they marry other men who aren't violent, in order to bring about a better and peaceful life for themselves as well likes for their children. Also, as Celie leaves the abuses by Mr - she looks toward a brighter future. She establishes a sewing-career, re-unites with her children, and doesn't dwell on her brutal past with Mr-. Finally, despite his being brutally mistreated in the past, Weisel doesn't violently rebel; instead he writes a book so that the world would know about the holocaust. He's educating rather than rebelling.

Racial prejudice still exists today, the only real difference is that it is not as open as it was in the sixties. It is hard for me, a white middle class male, to say what prejudice is like for minorities today as opposed to 30 years ago. I know that there has been a lot of progress in terms of segregation and discrimination, but it really couldn't have gotten much worse that it had been. Maybe by the turn of the decade we will all be Americans, or just people and not labeled by others as white or black or whatever. This would be ideal, but as long as people are different there will be those who judge solely on skin color, hair length, gender, and who knows maybe even shoe size.









Prejudice still your exists, but thankfully it is known as ignorance to many people, whereas 30 yearls ago it was thought to be "just the way it is". No longer 'm "separate but equal" accepted and that in itself is a huge step for reducing prejudice.
Zaitchik fails realize that violence has almost always existed in the world; therefore, these novels don't , promote violence any more than it has always existed. Of course ethnic American literature, like on all other literature, depicts violence in some form or another; however, clearly the reader finds that the main focus of this literature is to discover and and present peaceful solutions for today's violence.

Racial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert timing just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him assume it that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.

In Shakespeare's Hamlet, most would believe that the character Hamlet is just an ordinary Shakespearean character. Hamlet endures death and a crisis within his family. He having problems with love and with deceit people he thought were his friends. In the end, Hamlet dies for what appears to be a useless reason. This typical Shakespearean character only describes the surface of the character Hamlet. Hamlet is an Aristotelian Tragic Hero. He displays the qualities of an Aristotelian Tragic Hero through his good qualities, his flaws, and his major downfall that leads to his death.


I would advise our client to be themselves, while at the same time be agreeable, friendly, and see if they can find out if they have a common interest with the person. may advise him to read "How to win friends and Influence people", but to take it with a grain of salt and not to overdue the "lavish praise". Although our client might be inclined to do nice things for the lady, it would be better for him in the long run to try to get her to do him a small favor. This would increases the likelyhood of her doing him a larger favor later, like a date. If he does lots of nice things for her, she would appreciate it at first, but it would not be beneficial in the long run, especially when just trying to get to know her.
People need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make , people become , desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.





An Aristotelian Tragic Hero must display good qualities in order for the readers to have sympathy for him when his downfall is presented. Loyalty is one of Hamlet's good qualities. Hamlet remains loyal to something his father and mourns his father's death long after anyone else. Hamlet is also respectfull. He displays respect for his father by disapproving of his mother's hasty marriage to Hamlet's uncle, Claudius. Hamlet can be very clever when it is necessary. When he suspects Claudius killed his father, Hamlet invents a clever plan to find out the truth. A play within the play of Hamlet revealed that Claudius was guilty of murder and that Hamlet is very clever indeed. Self-restraint is another good quality that Hamlet possesses. At one time, Hamlet has the perfect opportunity to murder Claudius which would make Hamlet's life much nicer. the good quality of self-restraint saves Hamlet from murder this time.

Another reason that prejudice is not as accepted now as it once was is education and desegration. Perhaps, before people didn't know the sterotype was wrong they believed it. Now, people know that sterotypes don't hold up. are in contacted with people everyday who prove to them that not only are these sterotypes wrong are but they are also completely unjustified.


I would also use some of my own themes for helping him get for know her. I would say that I think Everyone wants to smile, and tha if he smiles a lot, it sill relax her and encourage her to smile. He shouldn't be phony or overly obnoxious about trying either ease the tension. He should be relaxed, but not to confident.



Although Hamlet displays a few good qualities, his flaws are much more dominant. He often acts on his impulses without thinking of the consequences. When Polonius is hiding behind the curtains, Hamlet believes that Claudius is there and without thinking to look, Hamlet kills Polonius instead. Hamlet illustrates his impatience while he is waiting for his father's ghost to appear. Hamlet can hardly be patient long enough without asking a lot of questions about the arrival of the ghost. Hamlet is unloyal to Ophelia, the woman he is supposed to love. Hamlet tells her that he does not love her and that she belongs in a nunnery. Hamlet also displays disrespect to his mother. He criticizes her and looks down upon her because of her quick marriage after the death of his father. Hamlet has suicidal thoughts many times throughout the play. He even gives a soliloquy in which he expresses his desire to kill himself and take the good way out. Another flaw of Hamlet's that he is a murderer. Hamlet kills many people throughout the play, such as Polonius and Claudius.


Today, Prejudice must be hide it just isn't , accepted in our society. We may practic discrimination at first and try to hold onto our sterotypes but quickly learn that these people are individuals w/ feelings and minds too. This is the point at which prejudic & discrimination become viewed as unacceptable.





Hamlet has many flaws, but his lack of respect for others and too much pride in himself lead Hamlet to his downfall. Hamlet seems to exhibit a great amount of pride in himself when he feels that he has the right to judge his mother's marriage and when he tells Ophelia that she belongs in a nunnery. He illustrates pride in himself when he does not respect the new king, Claudius. Hamlet's pride in himself lack of respect for Claudius leads to his death. Hamlet refuses to let his bettering judgement help him to make the right decisions. Instead, he chooses to fight Claudius, and Hamlet is killed. Hamlet displays all the qualities of an Aristotelian tragic hero, such as his good qualities, his flaws, and his downfall by his flaws.





For example, In a phsyciatric hospital Black patients upon entering were treated harshly then whites but once they had been there of a while everyone was treated the same.
















<ICLE-US-PRB-0031.1>
Be friendly to the person. Be yourself. Be open & honest. Don't be overly nice, just friendly. Studies show that people have a greater respect for people that be truthful and friendly w/ them then w/ people who are excessively nice. People like honesty. People be not like pushovers. In the end the person will be more attracted to a person who has told a them how it was with straight talk. Rather than made the situation seem different then it really was.

According to Lunde, 85% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know. Yes, statistics from SC do support this thesis. These tragedies illustrate the power of frustration on the human body. People who murder others probably didn't go into the situation wanting to murder the other. The person's frustration led to anger and aggression that just got have out of control. Even small things such as getting in the way of someone's goal can lead to the frustration which leads to aggressive act of murder. These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence. Through exposure, perhaps we have been desensitized to violence. The media also plays a part in this flippancy. When a character is shot, he often appears in the next scene. Kids, particular, aren't forming realistic schemas regarding violence. The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes leading to more rapes. We as potential parents must instill in our children - the future presidents, doctors, teachers, & even murders - a true picture aggression & the need to control it.
Spend time w/ person and find out what the person initerested in. What do You have in common? It is important to let down the protective walls we have around our egos and expose our real selfs. This involves risking getting hurt but is also may lead to devolping an intimate relationship.
The Neoclassic Age emerged in France during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1636, French Academy established set of rules it saw as an appropriate guideline to literature. These rules include the use of verisimilitude, proprieties on stage and proper character management. Voltaire's Candide can be appropriately labeled as a parody on the neoclassic rules of propriety. Through repeated use of sex and violence, Voltaire ridicules the French Academy's teachings.






Intimacy is one of the most important factors in a relationship. This is a bond developed between two people. This can often time lead to commitment. Which also is an important part of a relationship. These included w/ Passion make up three main components of a relationship that balanced correctly the end may end up being very successful.





Racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago. It is actually appearing to decline. This is evidenced in, for example, cartoons and t.v. shows - racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped. Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed - perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitably & cognitive dissonance. Perhaps through the media & other sources some misconceptions are cleared up or more realistic information is being provided to public.



Voltaire's attack on sex in Candide includes homosexuality, consent, and rape. Subtle hints to the reader reveal cunegonde's brother's homosexuality. He "never tired of embracing Candide" and was overjoyed to be reunited with Candide. The Jesuit also admits to taking a bath with another young man, not realizing it was a <*>. As Candide grows, he encounters several instances of consent. While Candide is living at the Baron's castle as a youth, Cunegonde sees Pangloss you giving the chambermaid lessons in "experimental physics", which she then tries to teach Candide behind a screen. In later travels, Candide sees two young ladies running "nimbly" while two monkeys followed closely <*>. Candide discovers that these monkeys are the young ladies' lovers. While Candide is on his way, once again, to find Cunegonde, the lady of house at Faubourg Saint Honoré willingly "gives herself to him" on the first night that they met. When Candide is first reunited with Pangloss, and is told that Cunegonde is dead, Pangloss reveals that Cunegonde was "as much as a person can be". And when the old woman joins the group of travelers, she tells them that her virginity, the flower reserved to a certain prince, was "ravished" the her by a soldier.


It is often true that people do not even hold these real prejudice attitudes they just conform to society's ways. For example, people not believe that there should be segregated schools but b/c of structure of the school system they do not find why there should not be.

Voltaire attacks the "violence rule" of propriety with more than rape scenes. The old woman says she saw her mother all of Italian women cut to pieces, and she was left dying on a heap of corpses. The old woman later experiences violence as she and the other women with her have one buttock cut off to be eaten by the men as the men's only chance of survival. Pangloss tells Candide that Cunegonde was not only raped, but also disembowled by the Bulgar soldiers. Cunegonde's father had his head smashed and her mother was "hacked to pieces" by the soldiers who invaded the castle. Candide is happy to see Cunegonde's brother again, but when the Jesuit says Candide may not marry Cunegonde, Candide <*> in the Jesuit's belly. Pangloss and Candide survive being hanged and flogged, respectively, but ironically continue to believe that all events are interconnected to "create the best of all worlds". The scenes of sex and violence, and Candide's philosophy at the end of the novel, show that Voltaire is ridiculing the French Academy's rules of propriety.


I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities of ideas & opinions with that person's or genuinely consider presenting his opinions & then converting to the others' opinions. He should also appear competent, but not perfect (the pratfall effect). He could at first pretend thought negatively of her & then gradually evaluate her more positively (gain-loss theory). The client should appear as attractive as he can w/o using his attractiveness to manipulate her. The client can hope (particularly if he is of avg or lower attractiveness) that she has a moderately low self-esteem & will thus be less selective in her choices for dates or friends. The client should also disclose personal info. to the client to induce her to like him. This advice can be backed up w/ research. It would be better for the client to ask a favor of the person - b/c from this cognitive dissonance, the other would view the client as being generally more favorable.

Another problem is that there is collectives prejudice that people don't even realize is there b/c they don't even consider the possibility of another way. for example, women truck drivers, men who want to sew for a living. These things just aren't thought of and therefore is an incontious prejudice.





One other problem is often times our beliefs create reality. We allow data to show what we want it to not on purpose but b/ it supports our view we may not think that there is a reason question it at all.






We conform to society und society's ways without realizing it causes us to a part of same prejudice acts.
In discussing sensitivity, the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one's own feelings, thoughts, the effects of his own behaviour others. Only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others' feelings. Sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication. Confrontation can get one more sensitive to his own behavior and how others interpret it. One should be sensitive to the others' interpretation of his behavior so that he know better how to act .

According to Lunde, 90% of homicide victims and their murderers were on a first name basis. Thus, they knew one another. The statistics in South Carolina support Lunde's thesis.The majority of the murders in SC are committed by friends, relatives, neighbors, or someone the victim knew. The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around. For example, a guy may get mad at his brother and then pick up a gun in a threatening-type way. He may have no intention of using it. But, as Berkowitz states the <*>. In his aggressive rage, may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.













Racial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. As this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white.

<ICLE-US-PRB-0032.1>



Another prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years. Various races are becoming more and more acceptable. However, racial prejudice is seen today in medical research. Certain studies are carried out on people of one race. Therefore, the research results may not be correct for all people. It may be that the classification of people for studies needs to change.



According to Lunde 80% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know. The statistics do support Lunde b/c about 90% of murders in S.C. are committed by an aquantiance. Usually these murders occur due to a disagreement between the victim & the murderer. For example, two best friends had gone to a bar & borrowed $10 from the other friend. The next night when they went to the bar again the friend who had lent the money asked for it to be returned. When the borrower didn't have it they got into a fight & the friend who borrowed the $10 was dead. A similar incident occured between 2 brother. One asked his dad to borrow the car for a date & the other brother asked his mom to borrow the car. When it was time for the brother to go on the date, he found his brother getting into the car. They got into argument & the brother w/ the date got a gun out of the glove compartment & shot his brother dead.




Adecline of racism has been seen in educational and occupational areas. the affirmative action laws have increased the appearance of minorities in the workplace. However, new classifications may need to take place in this area because it is seen that people are changing their race just to get a job even though they may not add to the ethnic diversity. Desegregation in schools also led to a decrease in racial prejudice, but it did note create a complete equal status condition. Minorities the schools showed a decrease in self-esteem. Tody, this problem can be corrected by letting students work in cooperative groups using the jigsaw method. Through these groups, the children gains interdependence and come to see who the other children really are.


Today racial prejudice is more hidden than it was 30 yrs ago. For instance, Dr Frey used an example on the test & in class that said he knew of people in Clinton who were all for minority rights, but they just didn't want them (blacks or other minorities) living next to them. This is a subtle form of racism that, when looked into with questioning, is just a potent & descriminating as outward prejudice.





The client should first meet this person. Then, he should set it up so he is overheard saying negative things about her. He should continue to let her overhear him talking at various times about her. As he continues to talk about her, he should gradually get more positive in his characterization of this person. As the person overhears the client each time, she will begin to like him more and more. This is based on Aronson's Gain-Loss theory. The person will feel like she has gained something by the end of all the times she hears the client talking about her. It is proven that people like a gain n don't like a loss. Therefore, this gain will satisfy the person and will produce a new friend for the client.

I would advise the client to be open and honest, but to do so subtly. They not be overly friendly or agreeable because studies Aronson cited showed that again individuals were more likely to like those who disgreed occasionally with them as opposed to someone who agreed with them constantly. It would be better for the client to ask a favor & then later do nice things for the person they were attracted to.



Aronson uses sensitivity when he talks of T groups and confronting individuals on certain issues. He states that communication is the best way to handle problems with people but because not everyone likes confrontation he says that you need to be sensitive for these individuals. To do so instead of blaming them in a discussion use the word felt in stating you position which lessens the harshness of confrontation by exposing something about yourself and not directly blamed them.

Aronson also , states that by say what you feel you become more sensitive to your own feelings which will make you more sensitive towards others.

















<ICLE-US-PRB-0033.1>


Lunde found that approx. 70% homicides were inflicted on victims which the perpetrater knew. This is due to the fact that human beings tend to become frustrated with those whom they like and love. When we encounter a stranger, we generally do not care enough about him to allow frustration to develop. However, since frustration leads to aggression, and we normally become frustrated with those whom we like and love, human beings have a higher tendency for inflicting aggressive behavior on our loved ones.



Fifty years ago, when segregation was enacted, this led to stereotyping and prejudice. Because <*> were separated, this caused tremendous outgroup bias, leading to deep-rooted beliefs that black southern americans are inferior. Desegregation, shortly thereafter, raised prejudiced attitudes because of competition, and the fundamental attribution theory. <*> in classroom situations, for example, the white and black students lived in different social status, causing black students to feel intimidated about answering questions and speaking in class. The timidness of blacks in the classroom, caused other students to see these blacks as "stupid", thus, lowering self esteem of the black student because of self-fulfilled prophecy. Low self-esteem only led more shyness, and for the white students to further believe the stereotype: black student is "stupid", because he does not speak in class.

Also, economic competition leads to prejudice, because the whites men believed they were superior, even after desegregation. The problem lay with unequal status situation, where the whites could not relate to the blacks social situation. Racial prejudice has developed a trend for thirty years, as people continue to conform to prejudice, beliefs and attitudes. However, in public housing situations, for example, where there is an equal status situation, prejudice is greatly reduced. Hopefully programs could be further implemented to develop further equal-status situations, in order to reduce prejudice in the South.



First, I would have the client identify the reason he/she initially felt intrigued by this person. Was it because they shared similarities, or because the person was physically attractive and/or competent? This firsts analysis may lead to the next step of identification: romantic love, or compassionate liking? If one is physically attracted to the person, it could more easily lead to romantic love, where Sternber used label passion and intimacy likes two key elements that would be developed. If compassionate liking is the status of the relationship, because perhaps the people share similarities and have a mutual respect for each other's competence, a decision to self-disclose, or become vulnerable to each other may lead to intimacy. This intimacy may lead to a further commitment to a long-lasting enduring friendship.

Dependency is important in a friendship, because we as to be there to each other in times of need. It is important to remember that when the 1st client asks a favor of the other, reciprocity will eventually come -but true equitable friendship not come with "strings attached". The two friends should equally do favors to one another, but without expecting in return, and not "keeping score".



Conformity can be derived from a model, causing identification. In the South, specifically, older generation of adults witnessed extensive change in the social status of black people. Although laws may have changed, deep-rooted prejudiced attitudes remain in these adults. As attitudes lead to stereotypes and subtle prejudice. A parent may make a very subtle comment which reflect his prejudice beleifs; and overheard by the child, he may conform to this belief because he identifies with the parent.

Also, unconscious ideology occurs, where there exists an underlying attitude, or prejudice, which may not had be consciously noticed. It are hard for people to realized the effects their environment has on them; and it may not be until they move away, that they recognize this unconscious ideology.
