It 's difficult answer at the question " what are you going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher .. I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of Public transport , like Cycle , Bike , Car , Train & Flight .
Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .
It takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra .
We have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .

In addition to that , i enjoy cooking .

My favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
On the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit " Puerta del Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .
But , if you want I look for a job from you .
My best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
You will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you for you e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
Also people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .
But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .
By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .
All this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , why I choose it?Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much!Example like Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that 's all will delighted us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : Be a super hero !
After many years he still dream to become a super hero .
He enter the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a super hero .
Pass some years of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him .
Kate was cursing the university of fashion .
Then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n't have heart .
He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
In following day , she said sorry and them was happy again .
But when them get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael get a knife and kill her .
He cried with a lot blood around .
Michael get away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
For instance , we take subway in order to avoid stocking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
Therefore , we need to think more about our future , our offsprings .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
In my country , taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
Car is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .
For example , carbon dioxide which is created by car .
It cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .
What other precautions , is usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipments have been found more easily when this process will be started right away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people come .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very carefuly at time to get off a plane .
If you are looking for confort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
Although , the better option , is pick out a train .
There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
Big project could not be finished without co - operations .
Friends could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
More importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , the families played important roles in daily lives .
The reasons are as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulties was told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
All in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
The Computing Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new discoverement .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old computers were used to occupy one entire room , now , they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
Old computers only let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .

I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable i passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him sufer .
As i did n't found nothing , i went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as i continued to go to his houes i notice he will alays go to tehe same house so i decidec to follow him to the house and i foun out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfrien so i finally gota an idea , i would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son i thougt about it again and realized that if i did that she will try to help him and they will be more united , so i decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , jus as he did with me !
But wait a minute am i really so angry to make this ?
Yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind i did nt had no longer control over my actions , i was afarid of what i had become and what i could do , but i could not control my self and the only thing i could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisaction i would feel when i finally had my revange , the best revange .
But i was so mad at him and so ansiouns to make his life imposible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the sufering i had been throug became stronger and bigger , i had made a desition i was goingo to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tourtoring me and not wanting me to be happy i would the time is nesesary for him to have a miserable life and i wo nt stop until i had acomplished my goald
I 'm not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient as give the chance to you to be independent .
On the other hand huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , scenario ddrastically changed in past 10 years
Development of biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was bring for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boost economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhance Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town , is environment .
Global warming is huge issue in today 's date .
Government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city .
Everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
People is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
Eventually human will have no more fresh air to breath .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one day it can be seen in whole country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football game .
On our school or villiage football stadium i spend a lot of time every day .
Usually i play football with my classmates .
Before training i ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
His main words:"You must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results " .
I can say , that coach is experienced person .
Not so long ago , we are had competition .
The first place was gotting by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport:"You must believe in yorself " .

Dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
It was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the rhthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia .
In my opinion public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because not everyone afford to buy their own car .
Besides there are lots of low income people who ca n't buy their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is the " Family " meaning ?
In my opinion , Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each .
In the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survival , I mean you do n't have enough money to raise you parent .
Back to the topic , I do n't know well any of member of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly .
I like NewZealand because there are many islands .
By the way , NewZealand have a cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also bought a lot of gifts like key chains , statue , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to NewZealand but believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I have sustenance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in Lentini , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Council hasn't a project for the environment .
People collect any kind of rubbish and throws all together in black sack .
Although the Council began to plan something , the people are n't committed with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where the people throw frigo , kitchen , " amianto " , old things or furniture .
What a pity !
The suburbs of Lentini could be wonderful .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in background .
When I was a child , I had a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laugh a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
In those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
I remember when I celebreted my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst day of my life .
There night I cried because I felt that I have not got any friends .
However , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
In there moment , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
Now , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has ever been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
Both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserts too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
Life of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
A busy life always compell to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind motor cars .

the tecnology have chanched the people 's life very much.in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life.for example my parents did n't whacth on tv , because there was n't any tv on the world when they were young.but it is n't the alone difference : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer ed at least the internet.our grandparents woundn't imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaday , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n't always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
In some perespectives , these problems are led by the over - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air .
So the best way for them to travel is public transpotations .
Each person should practice saving when using any source of eneny to protect his own live .
In conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potential and it 's stance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , how are you .

Thank you Helen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these type of book .
I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evening went to the beach .
In conclusion it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of Brain - drain should be tackled at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner .
There is n't too feww oxygen at the top of Everest to breathe easily
Jordan Romero has got 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Mount Everest is so high that it is very difficult to climb .
the top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 1953 .
My friends and I , we like a programs of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
Sometimes we are going to the party 's in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
They listen to the music and can we are singing .
It 's very good .
Jason is my friend , he is drunk and also he dance with your girfriend .
Jose is the best song . he is singing and talking in the party .
Other person is Angel , he do n't dance in all place .
He prefer study in your home .
Hello Something .
My names is Steven and I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in german .
In the moment I visit the Secondary modern school .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example there are girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
I love her look .
Her eyes looks as the sun .
But she is ignored me .
I hope I can forget her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is run .
I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feel me as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to run sportive too .
I am likeing to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The bestest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it hardly will have any educational value .
Although one could argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apokalyspe should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a forensic biologist and I deeply love my job .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well remunerated , I feel myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensibility , robustness of results and less time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different basics from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from eduational contents , there are so many foul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is " the sailor 's restaurant "
Here we can eat typical Italian food .
The last time who I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever eat in my life .
The atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls are decorating with a lot of shell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
the owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience price .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the asurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breacks down it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollute less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I 'm your employee , to serve on your company .
Very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
But pay a little low .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students complete summer homework , correcting homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
Just your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
In big cities public transport works well because there 's a good feedback by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient invest money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom Sawyer was a boy that lived with his aunt Polly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n't go to school .
On Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend Huck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
Then he saw a beautiful girl named Becky so Tom talk to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Becky .
Tom say to her of another girl so she got mad and she ignored Tom .
Tom was so sad because Becky did n't to talk with him so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
When Tom saw his house he sneak into his house and saw he aunt Polly crying for him .
So the next day the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many people thought that Tom was dead but suddenly Tom open the door and got in so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
The next day Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there is an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered like an andventure .
So they went to the misterious house and when they were inside they heard voices so Tom and Huck hide and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
the two boys heard that he was planing to steal some money and kill people so the boys start their adventure on stoping Injuin Joe ...
Hi , jo .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotei " and " izakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
Recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Sarah 's house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
so he went back to Sarah 's house and clean all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the bathroon she said : " I know what you leave there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the centre of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understanad .
Good Morning :
This is an esay about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n't boring for me furthermore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven't wait anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais , I hated that !
Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
Swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n't like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommended to people who not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this .
Dance is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupids companions that they do n't understand anything .
But this is another theme for speaking .
When you dance , sing , or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important por you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practise all the days until you can .
If you are tired does n't matters , because you like that you 're doing .
You 'll wake up early for going dance , or do dance classes .
You do n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ...
That 's a joke , you must sleep .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
Members of my family .
i love my family special my little sister , she has sixteen years old , i consider my best friend because i used to tell her everything of my life .
i have a dog it name 's chente , it is a golden retriver .
It 's a lover dog , he knows how i feel .
My oldest sister her name cinthya , she is really weird with me .
our relation is not good because she is so different to me .
Also i have a brother his name is jose luis he has twenty years old , his personality is dinamic and funny .
My mom and my dad , they are a goog guys .
Actually i prefer pass my time alone , i am working in other town so i stay away from my family .
Hi mrs .
Kate Ashby ,

For work in our cafe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cupcakes , cake , cokiees or brownies , the most popular foods of this year .
Another thing that you must know it 's how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good atencion and service .

we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be dissappearing , after that we will be having wars .
In 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
The temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed .
Because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
How to make friends and meet new people ?
It is easyier than you think .
Just ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend 's one .
Just try , it wo n't cost you much !
Good day ,
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Volleyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- classy game no friction between players
3- it exercise all muscles of your body
Regarding the above I advice all rookies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , the adults they can practise it as well and they will get the same .
As citizens of village , we totally care about environment of our village .
Every sunday , we do a mutual cooporation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
We clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
Whilst , we recyling inorganic rubbish too .
From inorganic , we can make bag , hat and other stuffs .
Then they can sell them and get income of it .
The creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of soles , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
What we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n't have other with him the one who create our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Satan deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . day by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dark future of public transportation
firstly . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future.because people wamnts privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondly these mode of transportation covers
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation.as a consquence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally i can say that there are various mode of transporotation avaliable
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous option fro travelling like many private company
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower faire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling.in addition many automobile company launcing new car with affordable price which insiost people to use more and more private vechile .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many pet .
In the peak time in the park is very busy even thought the park is huge !
Some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member have his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
Usually there are generation problems , sons do n't understand parents and vicecersa , but dialoging and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to sons to underline limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrange and update his knowledge .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
Recently I saw the thriller of mokingjay part 2 .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
The first movies , were amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance .
The fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the las part mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to fnd this advantage with others sports .
Apart from that , Karate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today topic is Technology .
Nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educations to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but todays generation is influenced whit technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can lent him .
he phoned me and asked me to lent him some money to register the competition .
he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chair for me .
On the other hand , in the future maybe would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trip .
In conclusion , in the future should have a bus so more comfortable .

Dear sir Dimara .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Patras a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
The vandalisme in patras has increased a lot .
Unfortunately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
For our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see that thing .
Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
Why to see that abaser thing ?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
In my opinion the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jessyka stavros .
All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
They are eager to begin a new life as adults .
But when they reach in - between period , confused feelings cross their minds .
As a rule after last exams they do n't know what university to choose .
What they will do in future they see , like in a fogg .
In this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
Firstly it 'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n't notice it .
But choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears .
Also they would have an opprtunity being involved in volontier activity .
And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel .
This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power for future education .
One year is not long period .
But benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan , this is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
People collects trash of their house and await the trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
Also , people go out to collect the trash that there is on the kiosk , the church or in the principal places on the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
And also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be cost every different options ? .
It would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
Lastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .
Rosa .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbours .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you are well .
I 'm writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Las Hurdes .
I stayed about one week in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Meandro del melero .
It was beautiful .
And there was a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
The wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garaje and there was a party , all night .
You should visit Las Hurdes , It is a beautiful site .
And there are a lot of things .
And the people are very nice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
In China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
In me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English do help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , especial its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
Because of we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for his big burguers .
Woolypools is a speciallist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have expects to be more famous , better and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space , that is very small for lots of people .
In this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a gift especially if it from your best friend .
Once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
It was my favorite flower I have it ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I 'm agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , not a happy .
In adition all pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy authought the society have a blame , because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
So that , politicians and film stars will have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
This is all .
good morning .
How are you .
come here .
Get down .
Get in to the room .
Get in to the bus .
Let us walk .
Let us play cards .
Let us sleep .
Let me in .
Let me go .
Let me see your photos .
Let me watch your house .
Let me allow to enter in to your cabin .
Forgive me . :
Bring that toy .
bring glass of water .
Drink water .
Eat food .
Run fast .
stop shouting . do n't shout .
Let us bath .
Once upon a time was one little ant called Penny , he was really small in compared with the others .
He hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happen .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
All of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n't find one ... They started to get panicked !
People just started to evacuated rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
Penny was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
Until the dawn all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one find something .
Like they were very religious ants they prey for her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
Something that they don know was that the whole thing was a movie !
So all was planned ...
The actors had monitors that watch the ants all the time .
One day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge .
So they make a plan to display all ...
The next day when they were about to start filming they ere non ants there so they search for them , but they ca n't find them ...
In that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
The ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
No one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
Basketball has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
Besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really cra
zy about playing it .
When I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it near sports centre .
I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , forest and ocesn had been used to destroyed to build more constructure and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe leadding to this phenomeon .
Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the persent day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people now continues destroyed more agricultures and forest in order to satisfy all their need , which will distory the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with this problem.first of all , reducing building constructure from now on , planting more trees instead .
Sustainadle development should be awaness to all human and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenmenon and problems should be worked out to resolve before thing get worse ang the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
This is not my first time that I study English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I want , so when I heard about that ooportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc.these options it 's more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health
I want to say something about the learning of the English Languaje , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
First reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish Languaje , my native Languaje .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntion of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just Imaging you the same but not in your native lenguaje .
Second reason . in the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but no always , Which is the rule ?
Is there anyone ?
The third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards this game .
My favourite team is India because I belongs to this country .
In India , 85 percent people follow cricket .
In 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that 's change the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sport man belong to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar know as little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
His stance , Style , shots , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not only me but also every Indian always follow Sachin for cricket .
When he was 18 , he played first game for India .
He is the first player who played 200 test in cricket .
He has many achievement like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
For a nuance first they have to decide what they con do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running , action , stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factor in batting .
Also watch videos of some best player like Sachin , Rahul , Sir Don breadman , Hayden , Wasim Akaram , Brett Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .

It may take very long time to find a job and you have not much time here .

My favorite sport is swims .
It 's because swim is really fun .
Also I think swim can keep our body fit and it can make the people who swim feel cool when it is in a hot day .

So these are the advice that I give to them .

The city where I live is a small village .
All residents take great care of the environment .
Organized shares , where everyone clean up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
There are spcejalne place where you can organize bonfires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
Recently , also on the roof of the primary school were set the batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation.there are several reason to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicle route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket picker .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the adventurer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
Like watching outside or sight seeing , to mingle and meet different people .
In addition to this I also admire the bullet train in japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle Ive'd known .
To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convinient .
Public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution .
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
Last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our offspring .
To take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland were over - developed and become an arid place when she was a child .
After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , she has no blithe memory in her childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a sought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .
Therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
The longer we burry our heads in sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too exspensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
And what about trains ?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film " The Fifth Element "

I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking care by me all the time when parents are busy with their works .
During my school , I like to play volleyball and i 'm an excellent player .
We used to organise competitions and tournaments with others school .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen .
We cook varieties of food and dishes .
I enjoy the dirty and oily hands in the kitchen .
With reference to the above , I will like to apply the Summer Camp job with my full commitment .
Contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
It is well known that many Art curators and Artists believes that Contemporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is unintelligible .
Luckily the most expensive art still being the old , like Picasso or Freud .
Nowadays a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at auctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time .
With this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create .
The sports days were held on Kwai Chung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th November .
That weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MTR .
I arrived the sports ground at 7:40 a.m. This year I 've join the 100-metre race .
On the first day before the sports day begin , we have the opening ceremony .
The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the anthem .
After that , the sports day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the girl 's grade C 100-metre race started .
There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal .
The teacher call my name for twice and he told me to stand different place .
So I know that there was someone whose name pronounce same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and the wind passing my face .
That feel was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
At last , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already try my best .
At last of the day , our school announced the mark the four houses have got .
My house which got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house will get the champion .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
Finally , our class got the first runner up .
We have a difference of 0.5 seconds is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from winning the champion .
At last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should used of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harming the environment and the world .
It is the best that all people go to the place walking o running on the other hand it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world along .
Whethere tourism has had a positive or a negative impact over our lifes , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorants .
First of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
Alongside with its development , the ablity of travalling has easened to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinaionals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the econmoy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the econmy , it thereby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences the transport . How?people become more careful at their historcal sites , this way preserving them;Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficently .
At a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
Through the development of tourism were born cruises and train vacations .
One upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
The tiger was the mom names Amanda of 25 years old , the herders kill her parents , because the herders were poor and do n't have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
The tiger 's boyfriend was a lion names John of 27 years old , his dad die because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
Her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her .
They die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
The 3 daughters where so different each other .
The first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a cheetah .She have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
The second daughter names Elizabeth is a leopard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
Had 12 years old .
Another animals give them rewards or bonus because she discover that water was liquid .
The last daughter was Ana who was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
She stay sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
Their parents were angry because she was the only one that never work .
One they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping .
The end .
Hello friend ,
I know you are searching for a flat to live for the whole next year .
Maybe I found something for you : when I were on the bus returning to home I read a journal with some advertisements .
There is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect to someone who want to live there for only an year .
There are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is a really cold weather !
Write me soon

Hello Riley , about the question you made me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music classes .
You have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free times you could still play piano without going to the classes .
This is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , Ines .
Hey my name is Joe and i 'm 21 years old and i'l think i'l would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
My current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and i'l can do everything as a doctor can .
So if the kids is going to hurt themselves , then i'l can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
The most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June , last year .
I had an exam .
That day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I revise Maths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to begin the exam .
When I started to read the tracks I fell agitated and I thought that I was n't able to finish and pass that test .
But when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
And this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I 'm really enjoyed hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind If I 'd have a posibility of going , I 'd already spend the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
At the beginn I went to the childgarden and they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
At twelve o'clock in the daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father took me between his knies , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was older , I could get better my dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I should learn skiiing perfectly like my parents .
Later when I was 16 years old , my dream get true .
I had my first snowboardlesson und I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive snowboard .
That was the story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowoarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the piste .
You are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
You are very happy und sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the winter more than the summer .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting dark .
his parents were worried and called he a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly
Everything was dark .
She open her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
A dark sky without stars .
She got up and look around .
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
She started to take consciousness although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
The problem is the last thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
She fell sleep again , didn't she ?
If she did , how she managed to walk until there in her sleep ?
If she was n't awake , why she could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really fustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She started to walk to clear her mind .
She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
However , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
There are three reason to choose this .
First reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .
As a result people can save their time .
Second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
Third one is comfort level .
Plan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
The reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
The young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach places which would be unreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in A Guarda and its name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The water was very cold and I could n't swim , then I played football in the sand of the beach .
I took the sun a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for a public transpotr ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport afer 5 or eve 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting question/
i think that it all depands from the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
yes , i agree , if you planed the travelling for a long distation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , couse firstly you;ll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
but if we are talking abot travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passangers

In order to attain this goal I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :

establishing the factories outside of the village .
protect the water sources and the sea .
guide the people and giving them of infomation , details and guidelines about the pollution .

Volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
I been twelve years practice volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 I be choose to play with a group of girls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n't believe the experience .
Volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice its so funny , but I advertise you , is not easy at first , but you hace to intent many times like you should do in life .

Michael wake up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
He read in the newspaper an interesting noticie .
The noticie was about a competition .
The competition is about write stories .
Michael was excited because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treasure .
He began to write .
The story was very good but Michae did not know how to end the story .
Finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n't put his name and address .
Yes , i think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
Also there are a lots of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new thing about past .
Comedies are so funny , so when you are sad u can watch one of them .
There are many discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
People like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restrected with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determinate the most use of the cars than the public transport .

Dear Paul !
I haven't written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you?What 's new in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
So I was there something like staff .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all ticket , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to cloakroom to get signatures from musicians .
I felt like a star!Crowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and my sweety girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it!It was fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
It 's a dual effect !
Hope to see you soon
John
The advertising is everysite .
There are adds in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be people tired of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
In addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In one add there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite season of the year is summer .
Why am I making this choice you clearly can ask , I love sun and good weather .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dear USA SUMMER CAMPS ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Teresa Wysocki
It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really importatnt for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
She was dreaming about being his wife .
She wanted to be his wife so bad .
But he did n't love her enough .
He wanted to break up with her at that party .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she is always late .
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw her , his heart started to beating faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of his home .
He followed and apoligized her .
He said he was drunk and did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged her .
He said he loved her and kissed her forehead .
He had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
He could n't just leave her carrying his baby !
No ! He has never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
One day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
And he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n't stand it .
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
He thought it was her fault that she has lost their little human .
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can gives a lot of satisfactions !
Your efforts will be prized by succeeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beah or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
·Others ideas to have fun
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !
Hi Jane ,
How are you ? .
I was glad to hear from you .
I 'm writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou .
You will come to the Reus airport , right ? .
Well , the airport is located just outside Reus , it 's small but it has a lot of servicies and transport .
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than take a taxi .
The bus stops at the Salou bus station .
When you get off the bus you should ask someone for the Spring Street .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .
Moreover I send you a map in order to locate the street .
This is my address : 4 Spruce avenue .
I 'm planning your visit .
I 'd like to visit museums , monuments and going to clubbing with you .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Best Regards ,
Mary

Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
Today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to complain about a recent package I received on Monday last week .
I ordered two batteries model 002545 because my mobile needs this kind of battery , but I have only received one battery model 001212 .
One month ago I ordered two batteries model 002545 on your online website .
I have a mobile model Nokia 1214 which needs batteries model 002545 .
The delivery was wrong , so now I am a huge hurry because I need my mobile to work every day .
If I have not mobile I will not be able to work .

Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
Desgin the bank notes are the first and indispensable step .
Peple should decide the background colour and thw artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
Usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
The colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divided the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distoryed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Eventhough it seems to be easy to make them , but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginings
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happinness of people .
He started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Easy recycling
Local authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
The results
As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
We want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Blanco ,
I 'm writing you about the staff recruitment for the " New Cloud Generation " project .
So we need your help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile so , we could accept people with one year of experience .
Is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
When and where do you prefer ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I tell you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .
Íñigo Ojeda .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice men . Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
In general I had only one duty that is checking quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
Working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
Love ,
Dominika
Report :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the next course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
Second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
They managed to encourage all of us every day .
This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level .
Third , phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .
This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,
Juan Orozco
I am keen on cinema thus I love to watch all types of fims .
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actors had a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drama genre lovers watch Babel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed El - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , living in Port - Said , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine Port - Said University .
My father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
It is n't just a dream in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true .
Last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
One of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drug for one the incurable like cancer , AIDS and hepatitis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
And what are the benefits of work and study ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .

I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after chilren from 3 to twelve yeras old . I consired myself quite patient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good too at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great weakness .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
Instead I believe it is an advantage .
Young people are usually hard - working and active person .

Is there a future for Privately owned cars ?
To be honest , I am not sure .
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
Imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very wasting time and not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
Together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
Finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
Something that made me happy was to see my family .
On september 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
In the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
The flight was approximatly five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
When I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
We went to long island because there he lives .
He have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin " Angel " who looks just like me .
In New York I eat so much , I also went to the city thay never sleeps , Manhattan .
My uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .
We went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
Finally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks like a ghost place .
It does not have too much to do but there were the falls .
I was amazed of how huge were the falls .
They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
I take too much photos because you do nt visit places like that everyday .
Something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
My uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblings .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious food .
Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
they annoying me
Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor .
People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal .
In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
As advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
Mostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
Therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
As a new college subject
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reasons
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , techniques and knowledge .
What a lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! There is an April now and finally spring came .
A bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
They are singing funny and building their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set our clock forward one hour in March .
The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
The days become longer and the nights get shorter and lighter .
We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one hour more .
Hockey as a life style
Although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you more than just being healthy or fit .
What are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
You think that your life style will improve ?
Well you are mistaken .
For doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have none of those requierments ?
Then you know hockey is the aswner .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it 's a team sport .
However it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
Through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
Why will I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
Hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
So stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
There are many ecological islands .
Each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
There have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .
Nevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this trouble so we make any effort to solve it .
We usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that this kind of things can have a second life .
As soon as the last river ends the southern border of Egypt is here .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
And as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
The Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of desert .
Nowadays , deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt .
Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .
The ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to dry or wet period .
They knew when it will be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries this building had been the symbol of this city .
It quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .
It was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .
It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
Moreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
However not all people are aware of it .
It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in saying public transport has no future .
Travelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
Variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .
Sometime I think that Taipei is too crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
However , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
They occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
Priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only elders but also some adult need it .
Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
Some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
News , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .

Nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
When we see all this cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .
But , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
If they will contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their independence .
But another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people who hate public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How many language do you speak ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do you want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is miles time important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons whcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
Third , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .
Over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
Due to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
Losing enough water supply , people 's body will become weak and rough .
In this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatred and sadness .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .
Friends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
When people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for the cause is the key to survive .
It is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n't choose that , this job has chosen me .

In our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
In holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life .
People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .
They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .
In holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habit in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
On the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
In my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Second , public transport saves city spaces .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .
Languages for the future
Should learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .
Also in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

Today , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .
We ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .
We had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in he afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
After thirty minutes , we had tea .
Winnie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
We had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .
Suddenly , Winnie fell over a little stone .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
Your knee is bleeding .
Are you okay'I asked .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was worried about Winnie .
I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
I felt relieved then .
Then , Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie 's wound .
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself .
Why ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unfoggetable day !
In my opinion the house in the future will be better .
House of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Big spaces will be divided in a few zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
In house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
Television will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that it can expand or reduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting part from my experience .
In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
When we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us .
Some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
My job was checking songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list .
On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it .
Finally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely .
Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
See you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggresive .
The way it feels aggresive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
If I had this house , I would decorat it in modern stayl .
I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -room , swimming pool .
If I had such house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relativs .
Together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
If you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
As the proverb goes : If you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important technical slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
A skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
That was only 30 years ago .
An explosion of channels arrived to our houses in the eighties .
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Number of Channels are gradually reducing
In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve some deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
Less channels means less choices .
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who watching this or that televison program .
You just follow a suggestion made bay someone .
You just click on it .
They have to reduce their budget
Despite of changing channels we see the same news .
Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it .
Summary
TV is dying .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
However the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20-year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the word .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Steve ,
It was good to hear from you .
Basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
As I told you before I ca n't afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand on it ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
Thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
Best wishes
João Matos
Hi John ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there take the bus which has number 111 .
Then ride to the bus stop " Zličín " .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly .
But if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to get to the centre . I 'll wait for you there .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes ,
Jacob
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to Foster 's Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
They are incredibily delicious .
I do not know how do they make and cook them .
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
It is a flavour similar to stay in the heaven or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
More than a billion people use buses , taxi 's and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
Many even use cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on goods .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a well Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develops imagination of reader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
You can imagine how heroes look Like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
Also many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
but all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than them film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is really great thing .
A girl was walking home one day .
She was with her mum ..
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Her mum could n't deny to her , so she bought it .
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
After some years the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be indepedent .
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!''she screamed .
And then ...
Next day , going at her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstairs ...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
Just you have to deal with the game .
You can choose lots of places to play .
You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and person who play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
This sport is not just about a physical power .
You supposed to use your brain as well .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
It is not fair enough .
Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and so on .
You can start if you are grown up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,

Essay
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new point of views about your own learning process .
Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skipe and others .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Handball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : Football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
Now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
The've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The desserts are very good too .
They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
There is a big variety of ice creams .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
In one hand , becoming a public person associate with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .
However , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are thought being jealous .
Notice any kind of failures .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .
In the other hand many of stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .
The value of their talent , abilities are counted in amonut of tabloids scandals .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their life .
It has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
The cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a ever changing world .
Today 's new things become things of past in few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .
However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
We need not to cram English words today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
to who may concern ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
Perhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's soon said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and openminded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I 've worked as social trainer and as educators since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor acitivities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As you requested , I attach it in this mail .
Best regards .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me for talk about their healht .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that they thought its help children 's brain to develop , but is important controller them because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect whit other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Friends should be like a shadow always beside you .
In the time of joy and sorrow .
Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does not mean you will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a friend .
The more people you will meet the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
When you find one spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
readers are able to express their opinion freely .
they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet computers instead books
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
Also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
Some people think that it is a bed idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
They insist on not using tablets at school .
Personally for me , I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless .
We should use it but we are must not forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
The Big Mistake
This day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
It was too much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
One part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
Her voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big mess .
She was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .
He stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
In fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is clearing .
Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
Even you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .
I searched my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .
I did n't knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .
Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gon na try to enforce the laws .
In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stalked him and it seemed that this guy has a hump .
I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .
He bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
We saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
DOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in the world .
Doing excercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you excercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take control of you re weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
Although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
» says a 17 - 22 years old boy .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
The main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .
Finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .
In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
Last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
The door was n't broke into pieces or fell down .
My curiosity had put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't happened like what I hoped .
I ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

Day number 8 .
We were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter " safe zone " and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .
We start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
But private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
When you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .
If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
At the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
The Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in New Eltham .
My area is very clean and very green .
People there are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time per week on Wednesday , robbish are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted into different bins .
That is very good idea , because that robbish undergo a recycling .
All my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
New Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .
Green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smoking room or non - smoking room .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef , it was very tasty .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
They have been present in our societies since ever .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .
Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
Also this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Shrooq ,

Dear Les ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Reina Sofía or El Prado .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpson family .
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .
Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
His parents and the school principal often punish him .
Bart is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .
In the Simpson family all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , Bart is funnier than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was one dreary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .
Who on Earth could that be ?
Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : " I have a letter for Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the text .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People are now self - centred and very narrow minded .
Though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still savage .
Dear Mrs. Ashby ,
Yesterday I was in Green Pepper Cafe for a meal with colleagues and I have seen the advertisement for a job at weekends in your cafe .

Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .
Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
People need easy , fast and cheap solutions .
In general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near your house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Is the car faster then public transport ?
It depends .
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
Speed trains are always faster then cars .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
Informal letter for CAE ( PART 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
Happily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
Take care of yourself ,
Favius
The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .
This whole business started to get on his nerves .
He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .
The one he dates is Angelina , not Malika , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not bad .
And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .
So yes , the decision is made .
He 'll break up with her .
Probably , even tomorrow .
It all started in such an idiotic way .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
At the moment he did n't realise that .
Only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .
At the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I speak English , German and Polish and as a councelor it is very handy .
I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .
Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp councellor .
I am also an accomplished sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .
I attach a reference from Tomasz Jaworska , who was my boss at the scout camp .
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
These days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .
The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .
Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
The first day started in an important date … Taco Day !
Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
Again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .
The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .
It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .
Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El asadero Hidalguense .
You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a litter of beer .
Almost a week in the Puerquitour .
The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .
You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
Ice cream in Tepoznieves .
Because Vic was almost with a foot in the USA , we spent all day together .
Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .
The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband .
Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
" Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
what a file is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
" And you know what wittles is ? "
" Yes , sir . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She has been waiting so long for this day to come .
It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away .
After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .
She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any sound .
But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
They agreed to meet the next day in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
Then , I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy , He was Felix !
So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
He stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L'Albero , the Best Pizza West of Italy
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .
As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
The space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
As a main dish , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of their pizza 's , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .
The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
The best places for young people in Dublin
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .
Several people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .
In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .
For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .
Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .
Dear Mr. Merrifield :
My name is Dmitry Lavrov .
I 'm a postdoc in Russian Cancer Research Center .
Our lab works along with Alexis Hervieux on his study of arpin .
Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've been having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you .
Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in pioneering study .
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells .
Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september .
Also I 'm preparing materials for the next publication .
Yours respectfully ,
Dmitry Lavrov
P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugo city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .
For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .
I think that Lugo is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
Among the most important I can mention San Froilán and Arde Lucus .
From 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .
San Froilán is a festival of National Tourist Interest .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .
Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .
I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus .
Lugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , bigger the problem .
The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July .
Despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
This is due to the low effect of the " Recycling Worms " program over the disposal problem . "
City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city has many projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beauty " , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
And what about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .
Some of them might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
And what about interiors ?
In our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see a home of the future .

Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .
Third , being prepared .
As the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .
You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .
If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .
Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Lots of Love ,
Iris
Dear Sir or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .
If I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .
However , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
And you ?
Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
Summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .
I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
Two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .
I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .
It was just flooding without so much effort .
So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .
The Carbon dioxide emissions is very small .
The biggest threat is the explosion .
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .
Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .
Besides , we need something that can work all the time .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

Archaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .
Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend your perfect holidays .
Hi Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .
Below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
The Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .
Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .
And all banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
But there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agnieszka

Subject : An important thing to do !
My dear Paul ,
I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert .
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .
I could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
What can I say ?
It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I am glad that they were satisfied with my service .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
Yours ,
Ionut
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what skiers use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
Little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .
The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
I 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality if education will make me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance .
Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
A dog is man 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
Dog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .
And that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
These hairy four - legged animals are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
The stronger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the dog 's reaction will be .
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grooming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friend .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kak adventure " , one of the most well - known centres in our country .
First of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .
Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort!.
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this centre 's really worth a visit
Write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
With best wishes :
Sara .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the desk of my room .
I checked the address as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Paris ...
My mother had written me after months !
Since she left to Paris last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n't cheerful at all , what made me feel really depressed .
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my mother had n't forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the labor market .
Aware parents disappointed with educational systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homeschooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compels us to seek other routes .
Homeschooling should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
There are lots of countries that do not
accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Spain can be assessed as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardize test and the recognition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks :
the lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
systems .
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as " the
solution " and blended learning is the future .
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .
Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
Otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
Over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
This shows how rapidly the game can change .
One lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditional team spirit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !
Triathlon : A famous sport throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .
What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
You must not push yourself too far .
A gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
However there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Farmer Giles of Ham " is a fantasy story written by J.R.R. Tolkien .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Giles becomes an independent king .
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

Does traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
To fulfill this dream a PhD degree would be the most essential footstep .
I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
You can listen to your favorite music or radio .
You are the boss .
However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It allows you to see much more in your pace .
But think about the costs .
Think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
Maybe cheap airlines are better ?
Being back to our everyday life .
Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we use the public transport to get to work ?
Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .
Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
What else ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's reflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : yes , there is !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
Why using the first narration ?
The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts .
How does the author create a word of horror to his readers ?
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
Just like the madman 's plan was happening right in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbeats .
To my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .
Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Shivering inside our hearts , the horror increases .
" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there " , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
They ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It 's a deer ! , its leg is in a trap " , Max 's friend shouted .
When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
By this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was injured .
One of Max 's friend brought water from the river to give to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - busines or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .
And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Las Ficheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
" Pistola y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirming that great places still exists .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
First of all : THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR HELP WITH THE ARTICLE ! ! !
Second of all , HOW ARE YOU ?
And also , where are you now ? ? :)
In my case ... I 'm much better now . I 'm settled back home and I 'm up and running , even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst .
Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches , so ever since then it 's going better .
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
So I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
As you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Anyway , CS and magic saved me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
Back home , everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now , should n't I??- .
So I had n't have time for much .
I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
There again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( days !
From Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . Plus I gave a rest to my ankle , which was very much needed too !
The two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike .
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had plan .
I have sent a lot of CVs , and have gone to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two academies ) .
About the pictures from Ramla , could you wait a bit more time ?
I haven't find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
Do remind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
( Please ! ) .
Did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
Because chatting is way faster than writing ;) .
I 'm gon na go now .
Talk to you soon , Mike .
Receive a big hug from ( YES , FINALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
Global warming and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates .
Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .
The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
The World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
It 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
Even when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed cricket religiously and have watched almost every match India played .
Sachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .
I am fan of his batting .
He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about cricket I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lara and Pointing .
To learn more about bowling one should watch Akram , Warne and Murli .
I will also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.com .
It has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
Cricket is going through rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandals .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
About two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called " The fault in our stars " .
It 's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this " more " .
Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
It is a ciclical process .
Rome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .
Those later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
No one can assure such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
But there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .
To : Sam
From : Simonetta

Subject : holidays are coming !
Hi Sam ,
It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
It would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?
Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
There are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th ?
I am look forward to receiving your answer !
Best wishes .
Simonetta
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
She came down , but she did not scream .
Instead she started crying .
The man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
Mother had always told me he had died in the war .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
Now we all live together .
Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
It is great to be a whole family again .
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
Sometimes , they became very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
Their architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .
Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first Castle , called palatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .
Apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .
In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .
Adolescence .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it could be also the worst .
Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
This could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
The worst part is that they get angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !
It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
On the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .
Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .
You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There are a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .
Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
There you can practise different sports .
It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .
There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea .
A part from sports , you should note two different culture points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .
Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Alcúdia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .
Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .
Regards ,
Paula .
Introduction .
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
The gym .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of Public Transport
When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .
Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .
Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .
All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .
If not killed then more likely paralysed .
There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
This is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .
More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .
Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment .
There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .
Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .
In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .
In Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .
The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .
Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .
On arrival they see starvation and death .
Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .
Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .
Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .
The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .
But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .
In the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
Will there just be one system ?
The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This loss need not however be negative .
In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .
However to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
Politically we are moving closer together .
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system .
To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .
When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
Trade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
Further changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a " European Standard " .
This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .
Many people would not .
Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?
It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied " , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positive approach .
Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
Why should this matter ?
Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .
Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?
No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .
It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .
Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This fresh start came about because of three main factors .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
These superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European " civil wars " . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .
If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .
On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..
To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .
People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .
It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .
Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride .
My soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .
To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
The basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network .
The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .
For commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .
In concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .
If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
To illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
So why do we still insist on travelling on the road .
The answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that " it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .
This is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .
I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent more and more people are now driving .
We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why ?
Do we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?
Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .
Even if we did , then shorly so does the rest of the world .
That could have disasterous implications .
The 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .
The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .
This has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .
The vital , small rail links may now be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .
We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor .
Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .
There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .
Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .
The argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull .
This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .
In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .
But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .
This example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .
The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .
The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .
The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .
Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons " next Live Lights " .
This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .
My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .
The British national lottery run by non British firms .
since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .
For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .
The lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
The lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .
Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .
This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
Also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
They cried , they cheered .
Their faces expressed joy , triumph , pride and perplexity .
The world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you heard ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " After all this time ! " , " I never thought it would happen .
" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-
Within a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
But for me , this had been the start .
It was the start of what our now as - President Bush likes to refer to as " our " winning of the Cold War --
It was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
Some had been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --
Bolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as well -- Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .
Whether the people are happier or not , I can not say --
However , they will have at least seen the " other side " .
Their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the " events of Berlin Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .
The use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .
Alone , they do not threaten us , but when they become welded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our hands .
Speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular .
People say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
and I would concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets .
In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same " I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help " type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
Until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages- German .
Since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United States has caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country lags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
Many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatos .
It is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what cost ?
In many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills .
In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
Many people have had their job positions taken over by computers .
Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
But even such menial tasks as filing are good for us .
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .
Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
As for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zombies ' .
We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
It is now the age of the computer .
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole rooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are they such a good thing ?
When calculators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a " spellcheck " to correct your English , which is absurd .
For the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .
This could be argued to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
Computers can offer escape from the hum - drum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - numbing and un - inventive .
There is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
Those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
The repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computers may be the future but what part will man have in this future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include : the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against , genetic manipulation .
Partly this is a ' Fear of the unknown ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
What people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
There is also however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
This then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
Anything in life can be misused .
Whether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .
Everything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .
Scientific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .
The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .
no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
But , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .
There are many problems facing the Monarchy .
Some of them are listed below :
The divisions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .
The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
Another problem is that people think that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .
For example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politisions that always lay .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
In the end I think if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertilisation " is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .
The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father .
Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .
This usually leads to multiple births ie .
twins , triplets etc .
There are people who are agains this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .
The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .
Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .
The menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .
Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
I do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .
2 .
Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
The foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .
Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .
Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .
People in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .
People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
Bodies can start their days in a test tubes .
This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .
The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
As the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .
The women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .
The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .
If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .
This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .
This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .
The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a viral disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .
With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .
The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .
The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .
Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .
The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .
If beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .
Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .
Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .
Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .
Watch this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .
Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .
There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .
BSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .
After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans .
This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .
customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .
In my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
As a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .
It has therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the agricultural industry and beef market .
The question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at hand .
If one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equally ' .
In the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
The stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early .
But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
Having almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .
A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .
The answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .
Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
These opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .
Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home .
Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .
These are groups of people that have defended women over the years .
These people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .
The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women .
Some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .
An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
Women just ca n't fight in a war very well .
The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .
They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does .
Feminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair .
Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims .
They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .
God would have created us all the same if this was not true .
Feminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .
I think that the traditional roles were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Divorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
Modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
There will be a woman in the presidency , and running a lot more companies .
Women should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...
Whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America .
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , thus defeating their cause , because of their aggressive action .
At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was therfore , detrimental to the good of society .
Although " radicals " such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning the Women 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle .
However , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " normality " and Women 's Lib .
This is still true twenty - five years later .
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals .
So what am I getting at ?
Only that so - called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them has .
For so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
Like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed was not so jaded .
Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
Television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .
Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .
However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time , watching sit - coms , soap - operas , and cartoons .
The T.V. has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
It has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties .
Therefore , since the invention of television , society has becomed more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life .
A discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .
AIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .
For example , there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .
With new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an all time high .
Doctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .
This has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even know it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
In the early eighties " casual sex " in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
Relationships seemed to be valued more than one night stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .
The twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .
In my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normal life .
Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear , cold war age .
In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air .
In just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .
With this , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis .
Although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .
In America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually arrived a standstill .
Hopefully , with continued efforts , our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediums of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goals .
With this thawing of attitudes , our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
As a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .
This " wonder - drug " also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured " in vitro " in a laboratory .
This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .
It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .
New drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
Huge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
The synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen .
In offices , the computer is everywhere .
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .
Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
There are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
The mental effect of computers is two - fold .
Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
This has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer .
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .
Granted , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " was able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroneous answers .
Mathematical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .
This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
Anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .
Yet there are practical solutions .
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .
Also , curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results .
The key is probably in the classroom .
People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing .
( This probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small FIAT , with a metal arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry , is often labelled .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
Ted Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
Presidents and dictators alike switch the channel to recieve first hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .
Decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , based on that nights news CNN commentator .
The leaders and presidents of enterprises such as panasonic and CORE refer to CNN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .
Stocks are an integral part of their livelihood .
The entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .
The money poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .
The Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well .
The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .
Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .
And one must not forget space programs such a STARWARS .
The creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
It has created an information age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The pro 's and con 's of the satellite dish are numerous .
The only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .
The discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1945 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .
The reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .
Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
Never before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augments .
For not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energize the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing this power in plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
Although we have many other power source alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
It is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
The saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling .
With the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
The current situation of the world 's environment is a sad one .
It is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable .
This is why it is imperative to act today .
It starts with you .
Write your local congressman .
An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .
The extend to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems , and international business endeavors .
The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also .
Life with airplanes is more rapid paced .
Cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century .
Another " discovery " of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
Of course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .
Even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .
Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
Only when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .
The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
Also related to this topic is nuclear waste .
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers .
Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We used to assume our natural resources were never ending .
Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
This links 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .
( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
Another important issue is that of conserving energy .
In the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
We have also become more considerable of our animal life .
We are no longer able to kill animals freely .
We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
One realizes that animals have rights too .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has change because of it .
I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .
This means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to edit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
Also , I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensible .
I 'm now here in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here form the US .
But , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .
W / out this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .
When booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
Computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .
Now , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " smaller " , more unified place , or a " global village " as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age .
Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
They can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situations .
However , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The waters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistant for centuries .
Progress has move slow like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves have showed little changed .
However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .
With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .
This wave is the microwave .
Never before has such an invention revolutionized a science like this .
A complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .
As History progressed , spits and barbeques emerged .
Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal .
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to staple .
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .
Flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .
However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes .
If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .
If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .
A mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .
The microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
Again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .
For As I have said before , there is no fire !
This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout History one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and differents perspectives .
All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast paced 20th century .
When I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
A machine gun can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship , propaganda .
In the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .
In the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Radio keeps people informed .
I don ' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different .
Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly .
At night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded .
Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
Radio gives the ability to reach many more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.
There have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches T.V.
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .
She sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
Television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
In short , I don ' t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .
One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
T.V. comercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .
In the 20th cen , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life for americans moves at a much faster pace .
People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inadequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
With everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
The parts of the new machine that need oiled and regulated .
When Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .
There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Français , that set guidelines for French literature .
According to l'Academie Français , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .
However , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .
Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .
In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !
Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .
Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her .
The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .
After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .
Candide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the church and state issues .
He attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .
When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .
Candide and his companions dine with 6 dethroned kings who represent the overimportance society places on hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .
According the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
Statistics from 56 are greater than Lundes ' thesis .
Frustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " trigger puling the finger " .
Today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .
Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .
This is based on eauity theory .
It would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .
Someone who live in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .
After living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .
This is conformity .
The same goes for Southerners who move north .
They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .
He adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .
Our country has been coined a " melting - pot " inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together to produce homogeneous Americans .
But a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .
The differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .
They do n't want to accept these differences .
They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .
Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds .
Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .
In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisophical / literal because their native language is so .
African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .
All these examples ( and more ) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .
The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .
Without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and prosper .
Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer .
With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .
Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent .
Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .
The V - chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows .
Some people , such as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it .
The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so - called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it .
The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable ( Stern 1 ) .
Some of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a Technology Fund , a Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .
These proposals could work if Congress had some support .
The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of " piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy " .
The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
Some television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers .
If a certain plot involves a murder , then the murder must happen .
Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown , but that is up to whomever is writing the television show .
Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager ?
An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence ' pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
How much violence is there ?
The most violent cartoons are ' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudd .
As for the shows containing sinister combat violence , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
The cause for television violence is to add texture to the show and not to poison children 's minds .
The infamous V - chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one day that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .

I 've been study English for several years , but I 'm not really sure what exactly my current goal is .
I've been changing the places and I do n't know which one is the best for me .
What I 'm sure about is the fact that I 'm going to need an oficial certificate in order to prove that I 've studied the language .
I study English because I love it and I 'd like to speak very fluently and watch a movie without the subtitle .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is talking but when I have to talk in English it 's not so easy .
I 'm very motivated and I 'm going to continue with my studies , but I need to have clear where I 'm going .
I 'd like to teach the language to little children .
Next year , I 'm going to focus on speaking and perhaps I do a formal test .
Otherwise , I 'd like to improve my grammar and writing so I 'll keep on trying hard .
Thank you for helping me .
The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic .
It is , however , in my opinion , the best way for the basis of government .
Consider a general election , in which three parties stand , X , Y , and Z , in a country of 5000 voters .
Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes .
However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power , which is not the majority of the country .
Also , the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency 's beliefs in parliament .
This has major flaws .
Consider , for example , the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties .
Yes , I know it is the MP 's belief 's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply is n't the case in many circumstances , the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment .
Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes , changing it 's policies , until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .
It is , as I said before , the best system .
Consider dictatorships , this falls at the first hurdle .
With this system any madman can control a country , having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries .
There is no fair and perfect way to run a country .
One please some people some of the time , but not all people all of the time .
The only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most , and even then people are discontent .
Hi karina ,
Thanks for your letter .
Of course I can tell you about Dulan .
He 's 23 , and he 's studying electronic engineering in Kelaniya university and he 's a second year student .
He has an elder sister , who has just finished her IT degree and now she is looking for a job .
His mother teaches biology science for advanced level students in Ananda College - Colombo 10 and father works in Peoples ' Bank as an assistant manager .
he 's a cool , charming and very sociable person .
He 's also sensitive .
When someone face a trouble , he does n't look at others and he go forward to help them as much as he can .
Not only that he 's a responsible and reliable guy .
Sometimes he borrows my personal things(laptop , pen drives ) and gives me back on time as it is .
He 's incredibly hard working.that's the secret behind his exams results .
He likes going out with friends , watching movies and listening to music - using his hi - fi headset , so do n't worry about noise!He 's a good rugby player and he plays for his university team.he's crazy about computer games .
He had already finished many famous computer games when we left school , but he knows the limit and knows how to manage with studies without any disturbance .
He 's keen on sports cars .
He has a large collection of pictures and videos about sports cars .
Also he has a quite good knowledge about automobiles .
I know most of the time he does some repairs himself .
So it may be helpful for you during his holiday .
The only negative things I can think of are he 's a bit untidy and not well organised .
His room is usually in a mess and sometimes he looks for his belongings for hours .
His English writing is very well , but he is n't a fluent speaker . I'm sure he 'll learn it fast .
Finally I think he 's really nice and that you and your family will get on well with him .
I hope above information is useful .
Let me know if you need more information about him .
Love ,
Lioyni
A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one which is central to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .
If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgement accordingly .
Of course , in practise , as the Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would in effect be fettered .
Dicey said that as each Parliament is omnipotent , and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .
The Radical like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act , and take us out of Europe again .
In this case , Britain would have retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy .
Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
British courts have avoided a head - on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
In a recent development , the European Court of Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
This case for the first time said that it is a principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary .
Young people are interested in many things like games , music , television programmes and the clothes they wear .
young people like children they like to play games , listen to music , watch TV , wear special clothes .
Now in 2015 the game that young people are interested in is speed stack .
In music they are interested in Taylor Swift songs because they are so wonderful even me hear it every day .
Television programmes actually young people do n't like them but they like channels that have horror films , romantic films and films with happy ending .
This year there is a fantastic clothes everywhere especially in UAE .
Dear Sirs ,
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement about the summer camps in the USA .
I am a twenty - year - old student from Poland and I am looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
I would like to apply for the job you are offering and I will intend to prove that I am an appropriate candidate .
In Poland I have been a Scout for ten years .
There I had various tasks , one of them was looking after younger children .
I helped to organise Scout camps all over my country .
We organised many sport and cultural actvities .
Apart from being a Scout , I also have been a lifeguard on kitesurfing camps in Poland .
I am not afraid of the work in the kitchen .
I am also able to perform the harder tasks , such as washing the dishes or tidying up .
I believe you will consider my application ,
Yours faithfully ,
XYZ
I beg to differ ; crime does pay .
Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .
Being a criminal has it 's advantages ; you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set up your own hours because you 're your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .
Let 's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person .
In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job .
Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees .
A criminal will always be employed .
There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment .
Then if we think about the work day of most working people .
The average worker works 8 hours per day .
They make about $ 7.50 per hour for their labor .
This is $ 300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions .
Tax deductions will run about $ 69.00 per week and deductions for medical / dental insurance will costs them another $ 5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $ 266.00 per week .
The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes .
Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day .
The criminal is his / her own boss .
And finally , the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker ; retirement .
However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they ( the criminal ) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years .
If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life .
At $ 300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $ 1,170,000.00 .
If he / she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone .
Comparing both options here , I 'd definitely say that crime does pay .
I was born in Thailand and have been living in Samutprakan which is a small city nearby Bangkok .
There are many types of transportation in Thailand .
I often takes motorcycle , minibus , and finally with BTS .
Bus is a transportation which I rarely takes .
From my experience .
Motorcycle is the very convenient transportation .
It is the fastest transportation while you were in a rush .
Even though it is needed in a hurry .
In the other hand , it is not very good safety .
Motorcycle is the most dangerous transport in Thailand compares with others .
Even if we have a traffic rule , some riders still keep breaking the rule .
Continue with minibus , there are some rules for this type of transportation .
The drivers have to follow the traffic rules .
I found that it is good transportation which cost low prices and travel a long distance .
Therefore people in low to medium class prefer to use this transport .
People who live around the city are usually makes an appointment in downtown .
Because of a heavy traffic jam in Bangkok so they try to avoid other services .
Then , BTS is the best optional .
It is very satisfy by time and convenience .
People can manage their time easier because BTS is fixed in time .
Therefore this transport is the most predictable .
Thailand is a country that is not strict to the rule .
Therefore , it can be heard news about accidents in the country .
Customers and drivers are not discipline .
My suggestion to those problems above is to start showing people how much priority of regulations .
Drivers , customer of even the police officers should be cooperated .

Humanity witnessed one of histories [ recorded history ] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene .
Although his theory [ his and his wife 's ] was basically scientific in nature , it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence .
The theory I 'm speaking of is relativity .
With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics .
It is difficult to condense this topic , a topic which has volumes , volumes a literature .
Personally , I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact .
This is probably for several reasons : First , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract .
It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure .
What Einstien did to humanity 's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained .
The socratic idea that all was known .
And that it was only a matter of time before a " moment " would reveal the knowledge from " within " was in effect shattered .
The philosopher 's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust .
Since it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [ 24 hours = day ] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it .
Although I do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to indwell the topic [ like sidphantha and his rock ] .
The point is my notion of time has changed ; And I think once humanity realizes that time - notions are human constructions and are subject to change , that then the impact of Einstien 's idea will be felt .
For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien 's " invention " for intentions not worthy of the genius ; namely : atomic bombs .
The significance of atomic bombs can not be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century .
It set - up a whole network of global systems .
USA - USSR ; with Japan and Germany as the " winners " .
Cold wars ; north - south relations .
Many things have been generated : namely fear !
Relatively speaking , fear has been the main point of departure for the global community construction .
This is a point that I think needs to be changed , from fear to peace .
A shift in focus if you will .
Some would say this is too utopic ;
But if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as does Stephen Hawkings ) our notions would be radically changed .
For now , we must deal with the short comings of humanity 's use of Einstien 's ideas : atomic weapons .
Yesterday I went to a basketball club.in my first training I scored 4 balls .
It was the first time to me to play basketball .
I think I was very good .
my dream is to be abasketball player.playing basketball is really fun and nice .
I loved playing it .
I want to play it again
It is undeniable that animals are vital to medical researches for its merit benefits .
Researchers could use animals ( such as mice and monkeys ) to examine the new drugs .
Furthermore , animals probably used to determine the amount of dosage .
These usages , certainly , identify whether the vaccine is functional .
In addition , it defines the maximum dosage which beyond the drug becoming lethal .
Also , one of the most main purposes of using an animal in lab is that the antidote for its bite , for instance snakes , have to extracted from their body .
Even a bite could kill a person if the suitable antidote is not available .
Writing about my favourite sport is talking about one of the best things in my life , since I 'm a sports fan .. and have been so all through my life .
While I was in high school I still recall dreading the moment I had to go to Gym class but somehow later in life I discovered that sports would not just save my life .
Furthermore , became one of my favourite past times .
No matter what my mood was , putting on my trainiers and finding a new place to discover ... possibilities became endless , parks , the beach , running tracks .
Getting lost in the middle of the Woods ... anytime , anyplace .
Then , one thing led to the other and started rollerblading , cycling , skiing or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
Little did I know at that time that I would meet the man of my life thanks to sports .
To conclude I would like to leave a message to all those Young people out there who does n't seem to fit anywhere .
Taking part in any free time activity would help you become a better person .
You will learn to share , to compete , to lead a healthier life .
Believe that the potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit .
As it said in the book " Say it again See it again " artistic research is quite complicated and a lot of time discussed topic .
In academic fields there is some question of how artistic research related to the research in academic framework .
When we look it in the dictionaries what is research in academic study we read this definition :
" The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions " .
According to the UNESCO definition , research is " any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture and society , and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications . "
Another source said that research is searching for and gathering information , usually to answer a particular question or problem .
When we look for Artistic research .
It is said that artistic research is process of making artwork .
Those two terms academic research and artistic research mainly different by the result of the research .
In academic field after research we have some knowledge which can be generalise .
A conclusion of the academic research becomes as the law which remains in time .
While in artistic research we work with singular knowledge which is unique .
And can not be really stay as a law or a long- term statement . Because of the experimental sense of the research , unpredictable , multidisciplinary , creative character of the artistic research is difficult to define what artistic research really is .
Also artistic research does not produce only knowledge .
it changes people 's mind set .
Artistic research is a research because artists look for the knowledge in order to create an artwork .
So in art research exist in artwork itself .
I have read in the book about artistic research that artist are doing their research without calling it research .

Watching " Cuéntame " might not be the first film you think of about the Spanish last century , but in fact there is a good example of our country 's history at that time .
Although , it was shot last year by a young director , he has known how difficult the life was , so it is more than likely he studied in detail society , customs , clothes or hair trended because eldest say it is a thrush reflection of the Spaniards life .
Even more , it said by pensioners that the movie makes them remind their young ages- so it is a realistic film .
On the other hand , it is more than likely that they could be a bit sad , homesick , and maybe they could lost a tear too .
The movie would reflect the life in an average family with a toddler and two teenagers children and the grandmother , who ever is wearing black clothes because she lost her husband in the Spanish Civil War .
As the parents are working out she used to do the housework , taking care of her grandchildren 's .
On top of that , it is watching the beginning of the democracy age and how hard was the birth of some polity parties and , of course , it is showing us how women begging to smoke , wearing skinny trousers or getting the driving license .
it was a strange change in this country .
To sum up , I strongly recommend this movie , not only for students or young people but also for middle ages and eldest In addition , it could be a great movie for foreign people so they could be able to understand easily our History .
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I would like to work in the cafe at the weekend .
I have worked cafe many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have used Green Pepper Cafe many times and drink coffee there .
It was very good and people working there are happy .
I want to work your place as I am interested in many foods and I really enjoy meeting with people .
I also work long hours in a cafe before which I like .
Please tell me soon if I have interview .
Schooling of the children 's
I think children 's must be educated at school , not at home .
Because at school they can deal with other people , learning since young how to deal with the situations , with other thoughts and cultures , and learn with that stuff .
Knowledge it 's not just what we learn sit on a chair , but how to deal with society too .
Does n't make any sense the person be very smart , intelligent , intellectual , know everything about so many subjects , if he ca n't express yourself , your ideas .
If he can not act naturally facing difficulties or staying calm dealing with the others thoughts , different of his ideas , demonstrating how flexible he can be facing difficult situations .
The knowledge it 's a combination of the intellectual and emotion part of our brain .
It must be a balance with these two parts .
So , teaching the child alone at home , it 's not a good idea for his development .
The advantage of learning the child at home it 's see and follow exactly what he will learn , the time of study , seeing closely what the child is assimilating .
But , like I said before , it 's very important help them to deal with other people and situations since little 's , to combine the rational and emotional part of his brains .
It 's a hard decision for parents , more for those who wants control all the aspects of the lives of his children 's , but it 's necessary understand how important a decision like that is to the future of those kids .
It 's more important keep the control of everything or leave the child learn with his experiences and develop other skills .
I like and really loved football .
I do n't know why ? just love that . my favourite club is Real Madrid and my favourite player football is Kaka and CR 7 .
I do n't care every time I 'll watch my favourite club match .
Through football I can see him .
He 's my favourite player , most favourite than Kaka .
If I can watch his competition I 'll watch it .
He 's my spirit also .
I loved a football since I was in 1st grade of junior high school . usually , I watched a football match with my father .
At the mid night we 're watching together ...
My lovely team is my Country Garuda Team you 're the best in the world .
my hope is national football team of Indonesia could be big team and best team .
This idea is completely erroneous .
Money perhaps , is a necessary evil in order to conduct the daily affairs of life .
Money , in some form or other , is required in order to carry out business trading , commerce and exchange of property .
Money enables a human being to store what he owns , to pay his expenses , to share with others or even to give to those in need .
However , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil .
This is a different concept all together .
The desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise do .
Although there is a healthy desire to meet the needs that we have , at times this desire can be pushed to an extreme .
How many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeds what was actually needed or required ?
Even individuals can be destroyed who are in constant search of what evades them .
They think that having the " right " car or living in the " right " neighborhood or knowing the " right " people can bring them happiness or contentment .
This love of money urges them on , causes them to neglect their families and at times to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .
Our society pays dearly , both financially and socially , for their love affair with money .
It is a cross - cultural thing .
We can be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen or the Spanish peseta .
The love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc in a nation , a family and even an individual life .
Not the money itself but rather the love of it persuades men 's hearts , capitivates their minds and influences their priorities and their behavior .
The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security when pushed to an extreme is the root of all evil .
It produces selfishness in even the smallest child .
It 's not long before a 4 - 5 year - old realizes the power that money brings .
he begins to hide it , save it , ask for it and spend it .
A healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster . is money the root of all evil ?
No .
It can be sued for good .
It can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has it 's needs met .
However , the love it , the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .
History is the identity of people , It can tell the future generation about the past one .
As all nations and people have their own history and to distinguish this only by marks left .
Historical place as well as archive are the cmost common thing show the ancien life .
Every nation has its identity .
In my country there are a lot of historical places that refer to different civilization .
But the most place that attract more people is the capital , we can call it the carrefour of the civilization .
Different civilizations set up there from byzantine to french passing by ottoman and others .
Our attractive historical palce in CASBAH .
CASBAH is historical city and has an important story about building it .
I believe I am a good person for summer camp staff .
Besides I grew up two children , most children are very fond of me .
I always enjoy sports , especially basketball , tennis , and dance .
Also I 'm good at cooking and reading books .
I hope you will select me as the job .
Dear Isabel .
My new town is so wonderful .
I really enjoy living here !
My town is near a lake and in between two bigger towns .
The main attractions are a historic museum and a very big indoor bath .
My favourite place in town is a bank at the lake .
I love to sit there and watch the sunrise .
Best wishes from my lovely new home .
I live in a tiny village named Fals , which there are n't lots of people , there are only , more or less , one hundred of people .
In my little village , the most people are farmers and they do n't use too many cars or motobikes , they just use trucks and other things .
So I think that in my village we take care of the environment , because we do n't waste a lot of pollution , so I can say that I live in a healthy village about the pollution .
But in my country we usually do n't take care of the environment , because people in Spain do n't think on other , they just think about their own .
Although the most of the spainish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not the present it 's the future .
The childhood , nowadays , is really involved with technology .
Most part of fun for children are video games , television , computers and tablets which they play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
On this way , is clear that television entertains and does part of our lives , but it can also educate if have appropriate subjects .
For example , some cartoons with their character can teach children count in other languages , resolve mathematics accounts as simple adds and the most important children can learn how to deal with their parents and their friends and learn what is wrong or right , in other words , television can influence on their behavior .
On the other hand , on television is common a lot of advertisementes witch can affect some choices and wills of the child as some kind of toy , soon he starts to ask this just because of the media .
Therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge about what their children are watching and learning on tv .
Thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen have to be controlled , after all the childhood is also contructed playing or the open air !
It is apparently due to the huge improvement of the automobile industry which makes a better transport environment with dramatic transporting .
You can easily travel from A place to B place while step into a private car which will create an electronic deliver lane and compress the data of the car with the driver .
Drivers just simply ignite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate address , map the three dimension of street view and then drive .
In only five minutes , literally , you arrive .
With the new way of driving , people do not have to walk through an 500 meter road to a public transportation like , train stations , or bus stations , while buy the modern cars which provide a better transport experience .

No doubt that all of us dream to live in a healthy environment which needs a lot of requirements from both the people and the government .
But in fact this not happened with 100% as most of people not committed by this as most of them always put the rubbish in the streets and not inside the place which they have to put in .
In the Village the farmers always throw the tailing and the dead bodies of the animals in the canals which dirty the water which they use in watering the farmlands and this leads to the pollution of the food
As a matter of fact , there is enormous quantity of ways of transmitting information , which always has been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .
We can receive it as from old - fashioned , or traditional , source of information such as books , so from contemporary types of media , for instance , from TVs and radio .
Due to all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , it will be considered some arguments to find the most effective .
Actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news about a situation in the world or the latest knowledge about the different fields of science ; whereas , books can present obsolete or inadequate information .
Indeed , scientists have proved that about a half of information in books becomes outdated in 5 - 10 years .
In contrast , we can find that some data in the television and on the radio are deliberately distorted .
Nowadays , there is an opinion that the media is the fourth estate , which can influence our consciousness .
It is too hard to disagree with it , when the information became a means of warfare , but not the method of enlightenment .
Then books come to the front as a means of history 's cognition : all human experience , which cumulated during all time of human existence , is represented there .
In conclusion , I guess that we should not choose the only way of communicating information , as all types of media has pros and cons .
Choosing the appropriate option for receiving the certain data is a skill we should learn .
Every year , there 's a winter festival in my city .
This year , there was more activities than the last year .
It was a great time to spend with my friends .
There were a lot of activities like snowboard , competitions and concerts .
There was a lovely activity for the kids called " Do you wanna build a snowman ? " where they spend an incredible time building snowmen .
I partcipated in a dance competition .
The judges said that I was an amazing dance and it was a very emocional moment for me .
I ca n't wait for the festival next year .
Football is my favorite game because it is quite challenging and interesting game . I began to play football while I was 6 years old .
Since then it has become my passion .
It is also called " king of sport " and is the most famous sport in the entire world .

There are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef .
For example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .
However , these occurances , are at best unlikely .
The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD .
This disease is the human equivalent of ' MAD COW DISEASE ' or BSE .
In recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .
This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago .
In the 1960 's and 1970 's , cows were given feed which included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .
Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young .
There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .
There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case .
However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people .
Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .
If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .
If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating .
Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount .
This is because with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
However , when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead ?
The answer is pork , lamb and other meats .
The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef .
This would mean , that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .
Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nil .
This is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets .
This would mean that the structure of agricultural industry had altered greatly with the proportion of it taken up by the meats other than beef market growing .
Dear sir or madam ,

In order to ensure safety for them , my school sometimes asks me to attend some first - aid courses , which gives me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
Particularly , I am free from June until September .
I am native speaker of Vietnamese and I was awarded a B grade in First Certificate in English last year .
I consider myself to be energetic , humorous , enthusiastic and sociable .
I would do my best to make a success of this job and I hope you would consider my application favorably . I have enclosed my CV for your attention and I would also be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient to you .

Interestingly enough , this topic is one that is very important to me .
I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things .
We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology , and using it to dominate nature , as well as our fellow man .
Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities .
We attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death , and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without our petty insecurities .
For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people 's lives for the better are those that have occured in the medical field .
Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do .
They save lives .
By closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions , one notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature .
We are ourselves a part of nature , yet we attempt to live outside of it .
We continue to destroy the plants , animals , and the earth itself and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways .
Therefore , inventions in the 0the century have had , for the most part , a negative affect on our lives because by destroying nature , we 're destroying ourselves .
In addition , our inventions are used to dominate one another .
We invent better weapons and better economic systems geared for killing and depriving other people .
Medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors , and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
They are one of the only truely " kind " expressions of mankind 's creativity .
In the modern society , especially regarding developed countries , traffic and all the problems related to it affects the socioeconomic conditions of the whole population .
Many governments argue that these problems could be solved by increasing the cost of petrol .
To my mind , this should not be the right way to solve them but other measures need to be carried out .
In many overcrowded cities , like New York and Tokyo , the first cause of air pollution is the chaotic and uncontrolled flow of vehicles which use fossil fuels to operate .
This trend will certainly rise in the future , due to the great number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
This phenomenon happens especially in developing countries , such as China .
However , an increase of fuel 's price is not effective in reducing the traffic flow .
Indeed , through the last fifty years , this price has shown a dramatic boost but the air pollution continues to boost .
It can be seen in some virtuous towns , for instance Oslo in Norway , that encouraging people to use the bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
The said encouragement can be carried out by a decrease of taxes or other money benefits for those who ride their bikes instead drive the car .
Another way to reduce traffic is the enhancement of public transport system , that is larger trains , more bus lines , etc .
In fact , many people prefer to travel by car because the train are often overcrowded or due to the fact that they have to wake up early in the morning to catch the bus .
In conclusion , although increasing the petrol 's price could be effective in the short - term period , this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and , so , the problem related to traffic .
However , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits due to the reduced use of the car .
Goodmorning ,
Last week I travelled by air with your airline , the trip was good but I lost my luggage .
It is big , fluo pink with blue lines .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation , they told me to send an email to the company .
So I 'm writing for receive my luggage .
I hope that you could find it because it contains things very important for me .
Write me soon !
Noemi
I 'm very pleased that you had taken into account .
I 'm Italian girl , I'm ninteen years ola and I live with my parents and my twins in the south of Italy .
When I was baby I used to go in summer camps with my family , I 'm growing up in a camp .
I think that I 'm can be a suitable person for this job because now I look after my brhoters , who are five years old , and I love cooking and playing with them ; I 'm growing up in south and here in summer there are many summer camps , and usually I work in those so I have a experience .
hoping to have satisfied your requests , I'M waiting for your answer .
The people living in my town are not very enviromentally friendly .
They are not that way minded .
For example , when it is time to take the rubbish out , the Townhall sets a committed time for this task .
Instead the citizens choose not to do it during this time but any other time they feel like .
I think this is not a very proper thing to do .
My teacher asked me about what I do in my free time .
I always enjoy playing video games and I usually do it at night .
I do it at night because in the afternoon I study , I enjoy doing it .
I hang out regularly with my friends and we enjoy a lot .
I think I am a privileged teenager .
In the past , people used to use public transport , and now people also use public transport , but with a small rate than in the past .
In my opinion , that in the future very little people will use it and maybe no one .
To start with , all people will prefer using cars than using the public transport .
This is because when people uses the public transport , this tires them from standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
Also , having their own car will help them to go easily to any of the place they want without standing and waiting for finding a public transport to drive them .
Ferthermore , bikes and walking will replace public transportations .
This is because people are now caring for themselves and for their health .
So , they prefer using bikes than using cars or public transportation for their health and for saving the environment from pollution .
Moreover , in the future public transportation may be banned to avoid the real harm of their toxic fumes .
Besides , it harms the environment and this can cause acidic rains and global warming .
To conclude , public transport are not useful anymore .
I believe , that they will end because of their harms , which is far more than its benefits .
Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades .
Every since the wild west , the civil war , and the drafting of the Declaration of Independance .
People under the age of twenty one are considered to be minors , when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States .
At eighteen you are considered a man , therefore you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
Eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States .
You can be condemned to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like all of the other adults over the age of twenty one .
Kids are dieing for our country in wars , but the government will still not allow them to drink .
How can you think you are a man and fight in combat , when the government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults .
I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country , you should be able to feel the affects of drinking alcohol .
Kids are getting in too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents .
Most kids eighteen to twenty are out of high school , and their parents do not care what they do .
A high school diploma should state that you are old enough to make mature decisions .
You can say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not have a diploma .
You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty one , then you are not able to drink .
Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do anything an adult can do .
There would be less crime in the United States among teenagers , if eighteen year old was allowed to drink .
Most crime among teenagers is drinking and driving .
They are left with this decision to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents .
They can not drink in their own household , so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out .
Eighteen year olds would not be put in jail for containing alcohol in the car either , which is another high percentage crime among teenagers .
Drinking should be prohibited to to kids eighteen or older .
If the government passes a law allowing them to drink , it would just make the U.S. a better environment to live in .
If anything the military should give convince the gonvernment to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink .
If they pass that law , I would feel more like an adult , and accept more responsibility because I am one .
The invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many people .
Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly and efficeintly and overseas travel has been drastically effected .
Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time , maybe a week .
The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely ( vacation ) travel , business , entertainment , and intercontinental relations ( politics ) have also felt the impact of the airplane .
As I 've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane .
Travel times have been significantly shorten ; for example , to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30 - 35 hours , but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours .
This allows people a greater variety of places to travel , and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination , not trying to get there .
The business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane .
As a result of the greatly decreased travel times , countries can work together much easier than previously possibly .
Also , business relations within a country have improved .
Today , it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world .
I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades .
Entertainment , a very large field , has grown with the invention of the airplane .
Now , entertainers , whether they be musicans , actors , or athletes , can travel from place to place much more quickly .
For example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid , this was made much easier because of the airplane .
Professional athletic teams reduce travel time , and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy .
The last area I 'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations .
This area has been positively and negatively effected .
Positive aspects are those such as " Peace Talks " between nations ; these would not take place as often as the do , if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going .
Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other ( in their perspective countries ) with the use of air transportation .
There are negative aspects , too .
Unfortunately , wars have used airplanes .
Japan bombing Pearl Habor , for example , and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan .
The invention of the airplane has had many positive effects- , unfortunately , however , it was brought about some negative changes , also .
Nowadays a number of cars is increasing and number of public transport reducing .
There are many pros and cons of using cars .
First of all , it is very usefull .
You can drive anywhere and anytime .Secondly , it is more economic .
There is an opinion that in any job discipline should prevail over talent .
To my mind , I would not even question the statement .
Firstly , only regular constant selfdevelopment ( which needs great discipline ) makes a talent turn into a perfect skill in different professions .
Any talent is nothing without discipline .
It is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without orderly hard work .
Even ballet dancers are famous for their strict discipline .
Secondly , even if a person does not have any evident innate abilities he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided discipline ) and become more impressive than a disorderly talent .
To add to this , the last World hockey championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against less talented but more disciplined American team .
However , not all people share my thoughts .
They say if you are a genuine talent discipline is unimportant because you already have talent and it is enough .
They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions and if you are not gifted , no discipline will help you .
I am afraid I can not agree with these people as I think discipline is more important than talent because only dowry is never enough , it needs support and day after day development .
As for creative professions , Pierre Cardin says that discipline and patience are on the first place for him .
I guess , we can trust him .
To sum it up , you see the problem is twofold and is a complicated one , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
Well , my first impression is that : I 'm absolutely disagree with the statement , because in my mind the public transport is much more convenient than the car or almost the most tips of particular methods for travelling except walking or bicycle .
The reason is simple .
Travelling represents energy , then if you must spend energy , is more economic and environmentally friendly if you can translate many people with the same energy .
Also you can use better energy sources and with much better profit with the public transport than the personal car ( like electricity from solar or wind devices ) and then your level of greenhouse gases may be reduced in an important percentage .
By other hand , you have a lack of comfort or worse or poorer availability for any displacement of you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport , are more significants than disadvantages .
There were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed .
The main issued raised was the unemployment that would occur in the pools company industry .
As the Lottery would sound more appealing due to the larger winnings , greater public interest and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon , less people would do the pools coupon , and this decrease in demand would mean that pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundent due to a decrease in profits .
There were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers .
When the National Lottery was interduced and also the scratch cards many people became addicted to buying them , most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future richness , for many this was not the case , and addiction meant large debts or resulting to violence and stealing to obtain extra money ; It was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick .
It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery cards encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers , when money could be better spent on other products for instant on extra food for the family , or saving for a holiday or a car .
There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackppot was to be each week and the idea of roll overs increasing this figure even more .
Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi - millionaires and the untold pressure of fame on the frount pages of a tabloid and begging letters would make many people crack , and that they would never lead a normal life ever again and lose many friends .
Finally the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes as everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery card than in a collection box .
Despite this after a year of the National Lottery there are many cases put forward for retaining it .
The main case is the amount of money of money that goes towards research charities , this was not the case at the start but was introduced later , also grants are given out to preserve our great countries heritage and culture , for example extensive work to repair an exsisting art gallery .
Also many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves and get them off the street and decipline them .
Another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if the demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not be also .
It gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week .
It has also increased the profits of many newsagents throughout the country as they get a small percentage of the money for each ticket sold .
There has been a literal explosion of inventions during the twentieth century ranging from the garbage disposal to the A - bomb .
Some were created to make one lives easier , others to make our lives longer , all were created for the purpose of advancing a civilization .
While each one of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another , some stand out as more significantly changing our mode of living .
Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition , however ; that is the television .
Before the late 1940 's entertainment , news , and information vertually all came through newspapers and radio .
A system that seemed to work , many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and or newspaper where they could get the day 's information easily and completely .
And , in the case of the radio , all was almost immediate .
Description of sporting events , voices acting out stories , persons of the government speaking directly to the people , the radio seemed the perfect solution to countries with its citizens living at all ends of its boarders .
The advent of the television changed all of that , however , giving the public a " peak " at what radio was n't able to give them .
Along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world , the television was able to add images- pictures that enhanced the entire absorbtion of what was being broadcast .
Where once a reporter 's voice described a scene , now the people could see for themselves what was happening because , for the most part , it was happening in front of their eyes .
Besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewer , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together .
A president of one country can be seen and heard in a country far away giving his views and ideas so that all can " understand " him .
The small town store owner can watch her son in his olympic race as it 's happening without spening thousands to travel to see him in person .
The examples could be endless .
The television strength must be realized , however , as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more .
It is a multimillion dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media which has become a significant part of our lives .
It is a power we should be thankful to control as long as we do just that , control it .
We can make television work for us in medicine , politics , education , and so much more so it is necesary to remember to keep the vision in television .
In Brazil , place where I live since I was born , we have the culture of practice soccer .
In my country , soccer is the preference of almost all people .
Today , my country is receiving the FIFA 's World Cup .
It 's the second time Brazil receives the World Cup event .
Last time was in 1950 , when Brazil lost the finals to Uruguay in a full Maracanã .
Millions of people expect Brazil to win the World Cup .
Environmental Problems
What will the future be like in 30 year 's time ?
We think that the planet will be in very bad conditions and the trees will be disappearing in 20 or 30 years for the deforestation , the humans will be having more wars because the water will be disappearing .
After that the poles will have melt totally because the temperature of the sun will be become crazy and very hard so some people will have died for diseases , for example cancer .
the air pollution will be to the extreme because the cars will be flying by the streets and the technology will be had totally changed .
Also in 20 year 's we 'll be eating more fast food and our anatomy will have changed .
So ... before that all this become serious , we must begin to take care of our beautiful world .
for sure the travelling by car is more convenient but otherwise I do n't agree with the first statement that says is no longer future for public transport because of too many reasons first of all that the cost wise secondary the population required more unification other than before in order to reduce the environmental violation and to save our plant also to enhance the chance to built a goof relationship between human in public transportation we need to improve the vehicles that provide the services either bust and train stations

Abortion is a controversial topic in today 's society .
Almost everyone has an opinion on the subject .
Many people believe it should be illegal .
Many others believe the government should not interfere ; it should remain the choice of the individual .
Hapeo povertyg personal choice and illegal abortions are examples why people should maintain their right to decide .
Abortion is the right of the people and it should remain so .
One in four women experience rape or attempted rape in their life time .
Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then being force to give birth to this child .
Would be able to love him or her ?
This traumatic event takes months or years to recover from .
Without the right to an abortion many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling that they would already be receiving .
Most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty stricken areas of society .
Generally children born into impoverished environments remain in that socioeconomic level their entire life .
Lower income families also tend to have five children on average while middle and upper income families tend to have only two children .
By offering abortion to the lower income people you are helping to maintain a balance of the number of- lower income families and middle and upper income families .
Women deserve the right to have an abortion . they won this right in the case of Rowe versus Way .
This was a landmark victory for pro - choice women across America .
Without this case women would probably not be able to make the choice today .
No one should be able to decide whether or not another person should be allowed to have an abortion .
This includes religious people and the government itself , because if the remove this right who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually .
If abortion were to be outlawed again would this end the practice ' ?
No many women would continue to seek abortions whether it be by some unsanitary underground " clinic " or on their own with some primitive tool like a coat hanger or similar device .
Abortion would still be rampant but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and it would be more expensive .
Without abortions where would all the unwanted children go ?
The basic plan would be to put them in adoption homes , but this would cost tax payers huge sums of money to support .
The average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty - five thousand dollars for eightteen years .
Infant mortality rates would sky racket alsop because there would be a higher rate of ignorant and uncaring parents .
The Education system between Iraq and Australia
There is a big difference between Iraq and Australia in education or study system , and this is stems from the learning styles as will show :
• In Iraq they still prefer the old learning styles the school giving the basic knowledge dependent on the curricula and in the same time they foxes to the homework , but in Australia they care more on the in direct educate through the song , painting , story , and they do n't care about the homework because the do all their duty in the school .
• I think the parents in Iraq care about their children result more than her in Australia because the level of education in Iraq determines their destine because the Iraqis people prefer the formal jobs rather than the free work .
• Bothe Iraqis an Australian believe the knowledge gaining through education and it is not
Hello , my name is Lucio and I am from Mexico CIty .
Nowadays the environment is in problems around the world , especially in my city , as is one of the biggest cities in the world , so four years ago I took the decision to do some to save natural resources .
The first tin that I do every day is to put a bucket behind me to collect the water that is wasted and then it is used to wash the yard .
The second thing that I do is to have energy saving bulbs in all of my house , with this action the comtamiation that case my house is minimum and the last thing that I do is to close the faucet while I brushing my teeth .
I can do more in favor the environment but at the moment I stay comfortable with the actions that I take every day .
Travelling by motorway today is not as easy as it was ment to be by any standards yet every morning and evening motorways accross the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
Not only is this ' ecologically ' unsound , due to the harmfull byproducts of the combustion engine which has been stressed in the press recently , but it is also stressful , time wasting and expensive .
Earth has a finite supply of the fossil fuels from which petroleum and disel for our cars and trains to run on , but ' we ' have a need to get to work which could be anything up to 200 miles away .
Not only is there problems in traveling from A to B but the likelyhood is that if B is any major city you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park there .
During pre - war Britain rail was the only means of long distance travel within the UK and so the rail system was more efficient with more frequent trains and many more stations , but as the motor car became more popular less people used the rail road and the system declined , the smaller demand has led to less frequent services at an increased price .
In my opinion the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused by the adverage two - car family .
The majority of the cars that you will see whilst travelling at a ' snails ' pace a long the M6 out side Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers , if these drivers had offered to give a collegue from work a lift home the numbers on the road would effectivly be halved .
Cities such as Manchester have tried hard to controll the incrasing numbers of cars by introducing by - passes and providing multi - storey car parking .
Some cities have even banned cars from entering the city during work hours making pedestrian life enjoyable .
Trams have been restablished in some cities allowing people to leave their car to do their shopping .
This in my opinion is the attitude that should be adopted not only by town and city councills but by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
It was like her first day at school .
She stood before the great building and started searching for a clue which could help her overwhelm this feeling of uncertainty , desperation and terrible curiosity that invaded her .
What was required of her ?
How was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings which looked so much alike humans but were not in the least similar to any other person she had ever known .
They were not animals , they were not machines , they were not automats but they were ready to use her and give her back empty , with neither soul nor mind .
She was there to negotiate the end of the war .
She was alone and they were millions .
They had crept unnoticed .
A whole and soon to be lost civilization was fighting to survive and their future was in her hands .
They owed her everything , and therefore they had admitted to receive her , but would they listen to her words ?
She knew she would just say lies , lots of lies , millions of lies , just as there were millions of beings with a reason to fight back : surveillance .
As she climbed the ruined stair through the debris and filthiness , there were still some pieces of corpses remaining nearby and the smell was so disgusting she thought she would puke any time .
Her watch showed 13:13 h , that was a good hour , as good as any other .
The sun was shadowed by a dark rose dust .
In today 's society , it is unrealistic for one to expect to work for a single company or employee for the entirety of their life .
This essay explains this statement from three perspectives : economic , sociological , and legal factors .
Workers do not gain financial benefits to the maximum if they work for a single company for a very long time . Intending to attract more competent workers , companies tend to pay more to people who move in from another company .
In Japan , for example , many workers conduct job hunting after spending a several years at a company in order to get a better job at another company .
Except for those whose prime motivation to work is not of money , one needs to think of working for several companies to get a better life .
One will be constantly exposed to degrading opinions from the society if he / she stays at a single company for the entirety of their lives : some societies consider people who do not change their companies less competent .
Again in Japan , because there is a social norm that competent workers constantly change their jobs in order to get a better job , some people tend to see those who stay at a single company as having no competence and being less ambitious .
Being very sensitive to how other people see us , we are less likely to work for a single company for a very long time with such a social standard today .
Companies gain more benefits if they hire new employees on a short period .
Some countries command a company to hire an individual as regular worker if they work over a specific number of years .
In Japan , for example , in the intention of securing jobs for the youth , companies are required to hire part - time workers as regular , full - time worker after the workers work more than four years .
This has been burdening some companies that are hiring only part - time workers for the sake of personnel costs : many companies , as a result , do not renew a work contract more than four years .
Again , it is unrealistic for a worker to work for a single company for the rest of their lives .
Everything happened three years ago .
His father was very angry with him because Michael was n't the person he had been .
Michael came back very late one night .
He was going out with people who were a bad influence on him .
They were drinking every night and they were out of control .
That day Michael 's father talked with him and gave him one last opportunity to change .
At first , Michael was out of control .
He started yelling at his father , hitting the furniture , so he was unable to hear what his father was saying .
Michael decided to leave because he did n't want to cause anymore problems , but it was too late .
If his father had understood why Michael was acting this way , Michael 's father would punished him severely .
So , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

Dear Phillip ,
I 've gotten your letter and respond you soon as possible as I could .
You seem to be very upset due to these two interests .
I think you should n't give up any things you love .
They may exhaust you and give you no time for taking a break .
I had been through this during my high school life , so I can totally understand what you 're thinking .
I would rather give you some advices as taking advantage of your times .
It 's better to schedule your daily events , which can shorten your wasting time like surfing the Net or watching TV.If you were still tired off , try to take a rest .
It 's fine for a time out but not for a give up .
I'm pretty sure it will work if you are willing to have a try .
Cheer up!I will always be on your side .
ZUMBA , A HEALTHY AND FUNNY SPORT
If you want to keep fit , you must dance zumba .
Actually , zumba is one of the sports that you can find in all gym .
It is a sport in which the people move all the body since they dance different kind of music .
Usually , one session of zumba last around 60 minutes in which you can burn 600 calories more or less .
Also , you do exercise and , at the same time , you have fine .
Moreover , to practise zumba is an opportunity for meeting other people and making new friends .
It is a sport that all the people can train : children , women , men ... as well as it is considered how a sport that does happy people because they learn a lot of difficult dances , can see changes in their bodies , look healthy and thus , their self - esteem improve .
If you do zumba three times a week and you follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight and you will feel better .
Furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session , you must warm up the muscles for avoiding any lesion or problem . You have to begin with careful because there are very quickly songs and you can do damage .
Also , you will need a lot of water for drinking .
On the other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest some songs .
To rest during a song is better than trying to dance all songs and end injured .
In addition , after each session , you may stretch the body very well and thus , the next day you wo n't feel the horrible stiffs .
You have to practise zumba because it is very funny . You will be the king or queen of the discos .
My city is not good transport .
We have only bus and the sistem is nt good .
They are late and there are very many people.b
The politics should invest much money in the system to better it .
If the politics use more correct the money , the situasion will be very better .
Unfortunately , I can not say that my city is really nature - protective .
The city is quite clean , but all garbage is transported to scrapyards and stored there .
Some of it was burnt down , but most of the garbage remains forever .
Well , not forever maybe , but garbage remains on collectors for an indefinite time .
Several years ago in my city special garbage containers had appeared .
These containers have several sections for different types of garbage .
But when a container become full , the dustcart operator poured all garbage in the same trunk !
So naturally , people was not happy to see that , and less than in a month all those containers were abandoned .
The next major problem with the environment protection is industrial waste .
There 's a river in our city which is heavily poisoned with industrial pollution .
Today all factories have filtering systems , but our river is still forbidden to swim in .
Nevertheless I 'd want to say that our city is changing .
These changes are not running fast , but they are in progress .
I hope that in a couple of years I 'll be able to say that the city is really clean .
People have always seen themselves as social animals , with living together as the norm .
Family life is one of the outline of how we understand ourselves and our relationships but also the way we build our places to live .
In this essay I will discuss advantages and disadvantages of different generations of one family living together in the same house .
In my opinion , there are more advantages but the worst thing , which can happen , is generation gap ( one of the reason why relationships between teenagers and parents or grandparents can be difficult sometimes ) .
On the other hand there is nothing better than getting on well together especially with people you can rely on and trust .
They are your family , you are sharing your time and space with so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
All you need is good communication skills and emphaty .
You can help each other when necessary , ask for a piece of advice and be able to take part in a reasoned discussions .
There are some ways to prevent problems , ways to avoid upsetting each other .
It is important to keep an open mind .
When we act like that , we will find that all of us do n't just survive but thrive .
Finally , family living should be nurtured and supported by all family members because the unity is our strength .
GOOD DEED
It was a nice Saturday night in Madrid .
I was in the Plenilunio with my friends as any adolescence of 15 years old .
When we were leaving the shopping center , I unexpectedly found a really weird handbag , I was shocked due to the situation .
Finding a bag with jewelry is not a mundane situation .
When I took the bag in order to see if there was any document or something that helped me to find the owner , my friends where turning blind eye on me .
I quickly took the bag and leave the shopping center surreptitiously while I was looking forward my friends .
As I could n't find them , I directly went home as if nothing happened .
When I reached my bedroom I saw that the exotic boxes I thought they carried jewelry actually carried banknotes .
I actually thought it was a dream , when I reacted I had been 2 minutes as quiet as a mouse .
What should I do ?
I take the money and make if nothing has occurred or I try to give the bag back ?
Finally , my regrets convinced me of making a good deed .
Researching for something that help me to give the money back I found the number of someone , we actually were going to meet when I found him on the street .
It was my neighbour !
I gave him the bag and , proud of myself , I go back home thinking about what would have happened if I , selfishly , had kept the money .
The question of a single Europe and whether this implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been one of considerable debate for some time .
Last November , one of the principle reasons underlying Mrs Thatcher 's resignation was her negative stance against increasing involvement in Europe .
Her view were not shared by many of her party colleagues who , on the contrary , were conscious of an all too pressing need for Britain to play an active role in a united Europe .
January 1993 is expected to witness the creation of the single European Market .
The aims of such a union are essentially economic .
All trade barriers will be broken down so as to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of europe , in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
In order to facilitate trade between the different nations many people are in favour of adopting a common currency , namely the ECU .
This in turn would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .
A single Europe , whilst primarily being created as an economic union , will necessarily have implications on a political level .
The European Parliament of course already exists , but many people envisage that in a single Europe it will play a more important role and its power will be extended , possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .
For supporters of a single Europe the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . They would argue first and foremost that Britain can not afford to go it alone and that it is in her interests to join forces with the rest of Europe .
Critics of European union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower which will undermine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields .
Personally , I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favour of such a union .
Moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favourable and bring about increased productivity and prosperity .
However , I feel hesitant at the prospect of a common currency , at least until the time when such a move might become necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view .
Yet I am even more against the idea of listening to political dictates from Brussels .
If the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger and Britain will assuredly lose its political sovereignty .
Academic culture differs from one country to another so , it is the most important and challenging task for an international students to adjust in academic culture of Australia for effective learning .
During my study , I have found a vast difference in academic culture between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , memorising lessons and rote learning is the base of higher education .
In contrast , in Australia students are supposed to use online resources for research , referencing , study independently and think critically .
At the beginning , I felt really uncomfortable to use online resources , difficult to develop own perspective and present a reasoned argument .
However , studying in Australian academic culture is incredibly exciting and rewarding experience .
There are definite reasons for the difference in academic culture of Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , university teachers hardly get training , orientation and research opportunities to update their knowledge so , they stick with the traditional method of teaching .
( Teijlingen , E. & Simkhada , P. ( 2010 ) .
As a result , the students fail to access research literature despite their strong academic success .
On the other hand , in Australia , the courses like EAP are usually designed to improve student 's academic language proficiency and the relevant study skills which will help them throughout their academic life .
( Budley )
Thus , skill based learning is more useful in our academic life .
In conclusion , for my effective learning at my university , I will access available resource for my research , improve note taking skill , interact with teachers and peers in the class , attend class lecture and work hard to be independent learner .
Amongst recent issues there has been big problems in by the amount of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today .
This amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M25 in London and the M61 into Manchester , this static movement on British motorways has caused an increase in gas emissions from car exhausts into the atmosphere which will eventually cause global warming .
A few suggestions have been made to remedy these problems but with no great effect .
A number of these are listed below .
An allowance of better access into Britain main industrial centres buy the building of large and susstacial highways .
A limited number of H.G.V. operators , only submitting a few lorries off their fleet to be used on British roads .
A kind of cataylitic converter for diesel engines to reduce some of the harmful emissions .
Another idea is for the government to introduce some type of tolling system to be used on motorway and main A roads .
A final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to make Heavy Goods transport compulsory for rail only .
Here are only a few suggestions of how too convert British roads , but just these few would be cause for debate .
The problems of these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .
Take the first suggestion for example a network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions due to the fact that it costs £ 1million a mile of motorway .
If there were only a limited number of H.G.V. operators it would drive alot of people out of business and that would n't be in the best interest of the government .
A cataylitic converter for diesel engines is a good idea but it would only reduce gas emissions and not congestions .
All the suggestions I have made have problems and this is why we still have problems on our roads today .
Dear Sirs and Madames ,
my name is Edda Preuß , I am from Germany and I finished my A - levels this year .
To get some new inspiration and some new ideas what I would like to do in the future , I planned to do a read trip through the USA .
But my plans suddenly changed when I read your advertisement for the job at the summer camps .
I am a very open - minded person .
I love to travel and to explore different cultures .
Furthermore I do many sports such as swimming , running and dancing Flamenco , Zumba and Hip Hop .
I already worked with children in the past as I was working as a swimming teacher for children from 4 to 7 years and also as I was doing an Internship at a primary school at my town .
I loved to organize all sorts of activities , parties and meals .
I hope you share my opinion of being the perfect employer for the job you offer .
I am looking forwards to meeting you personally .
Best regards
Edda Preuß
Dear Madam / Sir ,
I was pleased to see your report on municipal waste collection released recently , as I have long been interested in the data you published .
It was also great to see that the percentage of land - filled waste is lower compared to other regions and I was particularly glad to see that the utilisation of waste to recover heat and power has at least been started even if its proportion is still negligible in the overall treatment of waste .
It is my firm conviction that the proportion of recycled waste needs to grow during the coming year(s ) with shrinking the amount of land - filled waste quantities - to avoid the detrimental effect this latter has on the health conditions of the local population .
Due to this I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decision making , since they are likely to have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment while eager to utilise recycled raw materials for their manufacturing processes .
It is imperative that you take my proposal into serious consideration , because the growing number of illnesses caused by toxic waste in the soil increases the municipality 's social security expenditures , while ruining the lives of local families .
Yours sincerely ,
Carlo Paole
Genetic manipulation has been going on for many centuries in the form of selective breeding , both of crops and animals .
This technique has been of great benefit to the human race , enabling the production of more food , better food and new and interesting varieties of food .
Of course , it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it .
It is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides .
This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way .
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad ( or good ) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about , and hence can not be blamed for any later events .
Today , much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work , and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases .
The scientists who work on this can not be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example , in biological warfare , or to elimante a ' gay ' or ' criminal ' gene which may be present in human embryos .
Where scientists can be blamed , however , is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes .
These are now available in a supermarket near you , with their genes altered to increase their redness , juiciness or resistance to disease .
These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other genically engineered food , proves to cause a terrible disease , than that is the fault of the scientist who developed them , because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe .
Similarly , if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side - effects , that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market , and the scientists are to blame .
To whom it may concern ,
I am writing this letter because I think I am a suitable person for this job .
I love working with kids and I have a lot of experience taking care of them , also organizing different activities .
I love working in the kitchen and I am an excellent cooker .
Sincerely ,
Natalia
All knows that famous people has a hard life .
There are constantly in mind , in a centere of attention .
Famous people do not actually have personal time .
Is it right ?
In my opinion " no".I think , these people deserve a freedom .
Celebrities has 2 life .
First life is for the society and press .
Second life is private without cameras and journalists .
Like any normal person , these people want to silence and rest after hard day .
Sometimes journalists are waiting their " victims " around houses , and restaurant .
It is not very nice .
Often they are asked dirty and unpleasant questions .
Famous people also want to spend time with family , friends .
I think to solve this problem we need to indicate the time and place where famous person will give interview .
Police can arrest journalists if they takes interview in the wrong place .
Then I think this would facilitate the life of famous people .
For one thing they are people , but not a machine .
The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994 .
Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week .
The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints ;
There were , and still are , two principle concerns the Anti - National Lottery Campaigners still have .
For people living in high society a ' flutter ' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position .
These kind of people can afford to spend £ 10 - 20 a week .
The concern lies for the , and I use the term lightly , ' working class citizens ' .
These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery .
The problem is , these working men and women and un - employed men and women do spend money they ca n't afford .
The second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling .
The National Lottery after all is another gambling game .
The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
It is gambling , but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds .
A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery .
These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot .
The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under - age to purchase tickets .
The National Lottery however has its good points .
There is one main advantage to the lottery .
It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible .
From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands , the lottery has helped young and old , far and wide .
The lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich .
The National lottery has its good points and its bad points .
Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ephasised in this essay .
I believeit is a benefit to the country .
Dear STUDENT FILM CLUB ,
I thought I might help you with choosing an awesome movie for the club .
A thriller actually .
I absolutely loved this one because of its amazing actors Leonardi Di Cabrio and Blake Lively .
They played a married couple in their early thirties which had just moved to a lake house .
Of course after a few weeks strange things started happening .
At night they heard weird noises and moans coming from the lake .
Furthermore the woman started to see shadows and movements around the water .
And it only got worse .
I do n't want to give you a huge spoiler and ruin everything so I am only going to tell you that it will get pretty sick .
Someone is going to die and there is going to be a lot of blood .
I really recommend watching this thriller .
I you have the guts you will love it just as much as I did .
Until next time , Lea .
Hi Jo ,
I am so glad to hearing from you .
I am very happy because you have decided to come to my city .
This is a great idea because it means we could spend some time together .
First of all , I would like to know how are you going to travel .
From your city to mine you can travel by plane , train or by bus ; whatever you chose , you have connections to the center of the city , although for me the fastest way is travelling by plane .
From the airport , there are different transports such as buses , trains or the underground and they take you to the city in less than half an hour .
Travelling within the city is a quite expensive , however if you get one day travel card you will save money .
Although to get a job is a quite harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for the summer time .
You can try to get a job as a waitress in fast food restaurants , or as a retail assistant in shopping centers .
I hope this helps you
See you
The author uses a third person narrator , for which the third person pronouns such as " his " or " their " .
The story is seen through the eyes of Susan .
The narrator knows her feelings , thoughts and is able to see what she sees but he does not know any of the thoughts or feelings of the other characters .
One point which shows this is the scene in which Susan talks to Annie and she is wondering what Anni might think about her plan to save the dog .
From all these points one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
Another point which is to analyse is the mode of presentation .
In the short story we can find mostly scenic presentation .
The events are described in detail , for example when every step of Susans such is desccribed .
There is only one exception where the mode of presentation is a panoramic one when the events of the holidays are summed up in the second paragraph .
Furthermore the story is made up of parts of external action and parts of internal action such as the interior monologue where the reader gets to know all of Susans thoughts in detail .
Save Billy is a short story which is written in an informal register which can be recognized by the use of informal words such as kiddies and short forms like did n't and is n't .
The aim of this study is to verify the research trends in the Revista Educação Especial during the years 2010 - 2013 and identify the most developed research themes in recent years ; it also identifies undeveloped or absent themes the last four years .
The selection of the journal be justified because it is a journal with a wide consolidated disclosure and which shows only articles on Special Education .
This is a bibliographic research of qualitative and quantitative disposition .
The articles analyzed were accessed at of the journal site resulting 134 articles .
The collected information was organized into frameworks outlining developed themes and pointing out the number of articles discussing each subject , it 's was also tabulated the institution and if the article presented participants or not , and who were the participants .
The results showed institutions that publishing more in the journal are the Universidade Federal de São Carlos and Universidade Federal de Santa Maria , the majority of research do n't present participants , followed by the items with interventions made with professionals .
The most topics published are Special Education and School Inclusion , the less published are prevention and defining disability .
Noticed that some disability are poorly studied or do n't present effective interventions , as in of the global development disorder , there is a great concern to work with autism but little or almost nothing is presented on the other requirements which fall in this group .
Another example is in relation to the articles dealing with to the issue of deafness , another example is in relation to the articles dealing with to the issue of deafness on which we can verify only one from twelve associated to cochlear implantation .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise when I saw Maria Shaw , my favourite singer , in front of me .
She looked as beautiful as I had seen in her clips , but a bit worried . '
I need help , I am completely lost and I need to get to Valencia .
Furthermore , my car is broken , ' she said and I replied : ' There 's no problem .
I 'm going to take you to your concert . '
It was very exciting , because nobody has visited me at my cottage , but that day my luck changed .
In my journey with Maria I asked her a lot of questions .
She was very friendly and made me a lot of jokes .
She invited me to the concert and it was wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they had been sold in less than hour .
The best moment of the night was when she dedicated a song to me and later she invited me to supper with all her staff .
What a marvellous woman I met that day .
I think many people use car travelling because easily , but when you are on the road with your own car there are a lot of disadvantages .
One of these are traffic : if you take the tube you will probably not stay in tail for minutes and you will move faster underground .
For me people almost did n't find real potential of public transport .
Many of them think that move with their own car is better .
The high number of cars is really damage for the envoirnment and the pollution increases every day .
I hope that there will be a future for public transport which is more effective than the car .
I think there are advantages and disadvantages of car .
An advantage is that you can go everywhere you want with your car , but a big disadvantage is the traffic .
Another disadvantage is to find a park for the car in the center of cities .
Public transport also have advantages and disadvantages .
For example public transport has designed stops to do and sometimes there is a little late .
But a big advantage especially for the underground is the absolute absence of traffic .
Old computers were much bigger and more complicated to handle than recent ones .
They could n't access the Internet since there simply was no such thing .
You had to command the device by typing instructions in specific ways that few people knew .
There were n't any mouses and it was impossible to connect anything wireless .
One could only play a small number of games in old computers .
All of these features did not make computers very popular among common people but were used almost exclusively by scientists and mathematicians .
Nobody would use them nowadays !
They were far less practical and comfortable than our current every day devices .
In fact , there is no future for public transport .
As far as public transport is concerned there does not seem to be a way forward unless the can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
In my view the type of transport that we are accustomed to will gradually diminish .
On the other hand , vehicle industry has managed to create efficient electric cars , so far as they do not need petrol .
This is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the developtment of public transport .
It can be seen how each year there are more and more of the new electric models of Toyota and other brands .
Far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for the travellers who will be getting an important reduction in travelling costs with this new type of cars , which is provoking a direct decrease in the public transport 's use .
At this point something seems to be clear for the public transport industries : their future depends on how they will be able to get more efficient trains , buses or planes .
Why ?
There are two reasons : Prices and environment protection .
- Yesterday I was with my grandpa and my dog Willi on the beach .
Willi is two - year old beautiful puddle , which I got as a Christmas present .
- Well , Willi likes hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into the water .
Immediatelly Willi turned and ran for the stick .
He was back at the minute .
Then a strange man came to us .
He was tall and slim and he was wearing a coat .
He kept a stick in his hand but his one was bigger than my grandpa 's .
- As he saw Willi he threw his stick into the water too and wanted Willi to bring it back .
But he did n't want to catch the man 's stick so he turned round and walked away .
Of course we left with him .
- The man was shouting at us to return back for a minute but then he stopped .
The stick was still lying on the water so he had no choice , but to jump to the water for it .
Although the man was angry it was very funny for us .
Do you agree or disagree ?
The more money people have , the more they should give away for charity .
Nowadays , more and more people discuss whether it is a responsibility that a person who possesses more money should
donate more money to charity .
Some people think that more money a rich man has is useless so he should give
away a portion of his fortune for charity .
By doing this , he can use them to maximum effect . I can not agree
with this idea .
There are numerous reasons to support me .
Money can be used not only for donating to charity but also for having a perfect daily life .
If we want to live
longer , we have to maintain a happy mind every day .
For holding a happy mental , somebody shop every day .
When they
see what they want to buy , they buy them without the slightest hesitation .
Therefore , they can have a happy
life every day .
In addition to buying what you want , money can also be used to build a more wonderful world .
There are many
diseases that ca n't be cured .
Therefore , rich man can use their fortune to build a group which is made of the
excellent biological scientist to research some new useful medicine to rescue more dying people .
Furthermore , giving away money for charity is not the privilege for only rich people so common people also can
donate money to philanthropic organization .
Some people think living in a plain life is the best thing for them .
Therefore , the common people contribute a portion of their fortune to charity and just live a general life .
It is
so kind that they have great lives for every day .
Dear mRS aSHBY ,
I am writing for apply for the positioin of COOK , as seen in your advertisement .
I am a 25 years girl AND I am a student .
I love cooking .
I am interested in many exotic culture , for example Chinese and Japanese food .
Was draw us to Facebook ?
More than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many of them bemoan Facebook as a time - suck although they could spend this time for more productively on work ; schoolwork or real face time whit family and friends .
But something keeps drawing us in fueling of Facebook it can boost our self - esteem , satisfy our need for connectedness and self - promotion and help us maintain offline relationships .
But we do n't use Facebook in the same way , there are the sociable the lonely and the narcissistic they go on Facebook to satisfy different needs .
The University psychologist Stefan Hofmann find out that we use Facebook to satisfy two needs .
On the one hand we need to belong to and on the other we need for the self - presentation .
Facebook satisfies both of those basic needs , says Hofmann .
Some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connection .
But other people think Facebook makes us lonely and remove the contact to real friends .
Social Psychology , Sheldon find out that lot of time on Facebook with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and with high levels of disconnection .
A new study suggests that we gain some psychological benefit even from passively viewing our own profiles .
In a 2011 study of about 300 college students ' researchers Amy Gonzales and Jeffrey Hancock found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self - esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes .
The researchers suspect this is due to that we can self - select what other people can see on our profile .
Facebook can allow people to access information that they would n't otherwise know -such as a new job opportunity or a news story they might have missed .
The more different kinds of people you have in your network , the better chance you have of getting useful information .
Researchers believe social networking is likely to just continue growing .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise .
I was shocked .
He looked like Luke Guina .
I wondered how that could really be .
I looked at him and he looked at me .
I was sure , totally sure .
He sang in my favourite band .
I cried , " Oh my fucking god , you are Luke Guina , right ? I am probably your biggest fan .
How can it be that I meet you in our school ?
I have been on so many concerts , and never had the chance to speak to you " .
He laughed and answered : " Wow , I did n't thought anybody knows me in this school .
Well , my band is not so famous right now but thank you for these compliments .
I am really glad about them .
I go to school here starting from now … " We had a nice conversation and I finally found a very good friend in Luke .
I love the music of his band and maybe I will be part in the group as a second singer .
I would like to write about my family .
I am a mother of two grown up children .
I am a part time employee , working in a laboratory as a Specimen Receptionist .
I have been working there for almost nine years .
I came to United Kingdom in 2004 with my husband and my children .
My husband had come here as a student to study for his PhD. At the beginning , I was the only one who earned in the family .
Because of that , it was hard to provide daily requirements to our young children .
At that time my daughter was a teenager .
Initially , she had to struggle d to adjust her self to completely new environment .
But , I am happy to say that after ten years of hardship , my husband managed to find a proper job and also my daughter has become a sensible smart woman At the moment she is studying for a degree in Developmental physiology .. v
Dear Grace ,
You had a bad accident that changed your life forever .
It 's normal that now you 're depressed and you think it 's not worth living anymore but you must think about all the beautiful things that you can do anyway , even if you 'll do them in a different way .
You need to think positive and try to enjoy yourself , do n't think about the past , just live your life in the present , do n't be discouraged and do n't let this problem change your life .
Ever if it seems impossible to be optimistic , it depends only by you , you need to want it .
In order to determine whether or not crime pays , one should first define what is meant by the word " pays " .
If a person gains $ 100 in a jewelry store theft , yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 for a hideout hotel room , then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole .
However , the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of " pay " than simple dollars and cents accounting .
In terms of criminal work , pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manners of loss that occur as a result .
One issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above .
Crime , like any small business , requires an investment .
One investment is time .
If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify that time expenditure , then the crime has not paid .
Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field .
If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then crimes can earn less to justify time spent .
If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions , then his crimes must earn more .
Other capital investments in crime could include equiptment such as get - away cars , dynamite , weaponry , and disguises .
Mafia and police pay - offs could be involved .
Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting monies earned with other involved parties .
A crime 's income must be enough to cover all these expenditures .
Another type of loss to be considered is loss of mental or physical health and well being .
Many times violence is a part of crime .
The cost of taking a gunshot or knife in the leg is more than just the medical bills .
It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again .
Very few criminals have worker 's compensation .
The stress that comes about from constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself , and could lessen both a person 's life span and enjoyment of life .
Legal problems could become both a capital loss and a health related loss .
Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the capital loss of a more expensive attorney , he could pay with the health loss of being imprisoned .
Even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal entanglements can be very stressful and unhealthy .
Does crime pay ?
In some cases it may , but the small businessman criminal must deal with the same risks as the legitimate businessman .
Larger criminal corporations will always seek to drive him out of business , and he may have to work long hours for small gains .
However , he does better the legitimate businessman on one count : no taxes .
In my home town of Kalamazoo , the invention of the shopping mall has changed the lives of the people in our town and the town itself .
While many people enjoy and utilize the shopping malls , I believe that they are more of a detriment than a blessing .
Kalamazoo , like most American cities , began surrounding the central means of transportation .
Cities were first located near water , then near train tracks , and then began to locate themselves farther away due to the inventions of trucks and cars .
Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful district .
Near the train station were the larger industries , and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies .
Homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city ; however , many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families to live in .
Everyone was near the central city - so everyone could use the central city .
Rich and poor alike had easy access to the offerings of the central city .
Throughout history , the trend is for the rich to get richer and the poor remain poor .
While the rich got richer , they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside of the city limits .
And , the more wealthy moved from the inner city ( with help from the invention of the automobile ) to the suburbs where the could keep a distance from the busy inner city .
While the more wealthy began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working class remained due to lack of transportation or money to move outwards .
This process has left the businesses in the inner cities , including Kalamazoo , without a stable clientel .
Why should we , say those with cars , go downtown where the more poorer people are and have to shop outside going from specialized store to store , when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did , and still do , and relocate in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves .
I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or enjoy the downtown district remain and stay in business .
Many larger factories and office building still remain downtown .
And , the executives and business people rely on commuting to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once , a thriving neighborhood .
and still could be !
One feature that does attract business is colleges .
Kalamazoo has 1 large university , 1 private college and two " community-2 yr .
" colleges .
The large and private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kalamazoo , so many business try to cater to our tastes- clubs , cafés and other stores .
Another attempt to reinstate success is downtown festivals .
We have many , and they always attract those from the suburbs .
This disintegration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects : the poor and lower middle class .
There neighborhoods do n't get financial support and money is not spent in the stores near them .
If they could have more money and leave , the majority would .
Shopping malls , strip malls , and the flu from the inner cities by upperclass Americans will only hurt those who ca n't escape in the end - in fact , it already is hurting business and lives in the downtown districts .

The advancement in technology have major influence over transportation systems , and the new road ways are more convenient to travel .
As personal transportation provides more convenient options to peoples , the public transport system are losing their market .
The market of personal vehicles become more cheaper and safer than previous a major hike is seen in their growth .
Now peoples being more professional are quite keen to save their valuable time moving from scheduled public transport to personal cars.luxury and speed become a status symbol for car owners and even it is a better way to ignore public interaction and annoyance .
New multitasking life style better suits for the preference of personal cars , to keep and carry all those thinks one need .
Since Maggie 's class won the prize in the basketball game , their teacher took them to a nature reserve to observe animals .
Maggie with her best friends was so excited that they kept taking pictures with animals .
Half way through the tour , they went to the hippo area .
Fortunately , the hippo mother gave a new birth last month .
The hippo baby was so cute that Maggie wanted to take a picture with it more closely .
However , littled Maggie known that the mother was nearby and assumed that she was attacking her baby .
The mother ran out of the river and chased after Maggie .
As the teacher saw the scene , she called the staff of the reserve to save Maggie from the horrible hippo .
After a few minutes , several strong men came to shoot it up with a tranquilizer dart .
It was such a fortune that no one was injured .
Nevertheless , Maggie sincerely regretted being a trouble maker .
She has vowed that she would stay away from wild animals , no matter how gentle they might look .
During the 20th century there have been several world wide discoveries that have significantly influenced peoples lives .
I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual .
Every individual holds a different perspective of life and what they consider to be valuable and important .
I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice and discrimination as my topic , because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace .
Cultural and racial equality is a new term that as a society we are striving for .
People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today 's society .
As individuals we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminitive media language and advertising .
In the past this type of discrimination , which includes more then blacks African Americans , but also other ethnicities and women , has been excepted as a way of life .
Few individuals have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes , and inequality , and demand freedom and equality .
Numerous hidden talents , strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society .
However , today we are beginning to move in a new direction .
People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be unlearned .
Together as a society , and as a much larger world we are recognizing the value in learning from difference .
Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed but rather they are being celebrated .
Organizations and forms are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism .
The opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up , the avalibility to study cultural difference and reflect the knowledge on ourselves is improving .
Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existance of all humanity .
As human beings we need each other and we need to be willing to accept those who are different .
The advantage to be famous is mainly that you can more privilage than other people , like entering to places without making a queue or even not paying your bill in any cases .
In the other hand , and my opinion it has more bad things than good ones .
Everyone can recognize you , then they could bother you to ask for a signature .
So you ca n't move with freedom wherever , and you have to hide for resting of the crowded .
That 's all in my view .

For as long as man has been alive , he has invented things .
Important early discoveries included the wheel and fire .
In the long line of such discoveries , modern man has continously found new ways to make his life easier .
So , naturally , when man invented the washing machine , millions and millions of lives were made simpler .
The washing machine , in those houses that own them , has almost become a necesity .
Should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furiously running about in the streets , clutching the machine tightly to their chests .
In today 's society , to be with out a washing machine , or any other electric gadget , seems to be devastating .
What ever would a college student do with out a washing machine ?
Where would we find the time to hand wash our clothes ?
The mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers , students , and adults alike .
This modern invention , the washing machine , has put fear of handclothes washing in the hearts of many .
Give an average adult a washing board and soap and tell him / her to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on his / her face .
Thus , it is easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , toaster ovens , and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives , they also aid us in our modern process of rushing around .
These " wonders " make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor .
But is that all that bad ?
.... Many housewives would insist on its benefits , and I would have to agree .
But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet do n't allow us to exercise , to use our muscles .
It is no small wonder that in today 's " modern " society , as we continously use our " modern gadgets " , we are increasingly needing diet programs and other such systems .
Yes , the old days were hard , but was weight watchers ever an issue ?
Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .
This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss .
Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialized in all fields of study : even if they have a degree in History , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .
Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities of meeting new people and making friends .
This is n't a good thing for the children because that way they are n't socializing , and when it comes the moment of having an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behave .
On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students that , due to their complicated situation -like an illness- , can not go to school like the other children .
To sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it , because in the majority of cases , parents haven't the same knowledge as teachers .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era , it is almost one of the most deadly .
During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head , and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells .
The brain is encased in the skull , but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid ' shock - absorber ' to protect the rain .
Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull , damaging it more and more every time .
So , a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years , ten for example , and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there .
Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects , yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose , eyes , teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma , haemorage or die .
Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive .
The question that people have is : is that person really worth several million pounds ?
Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds .
Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else , more important , where people are n't getting paid to fight .
The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport , there is an incredibly big demand for it .
Boxing is one of the most popular sports , and it will be difficult to ban it .
Not only does it satisfy the viewers but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them .
A study group is that a crowd of people gather in and discuss some topics they chose .
So , if you join a study group , you can understand what other 's idea are and how they think about this problem .
Also , you can exchange your own ideas to others so that there will be a discussion about it .
Though this discussion , I think we can realize our thinking and other 's opinions more clearly .
Other benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and methodically ; that is , your speaking skill will be improved .
However , why do some people still study on their own ?
In my opinions , I need to consider one question deeply by myself .
Sometimes , too many other thinking do disturb me !
Maybe I will become a person who only listen to others ' ideas and never think by myself if I depend on study groups seriously .
To join study groups is a good way to inspire your learning motivation , but do n't forget , sometimes you have to leave yourself alone and consider what you have learned calmly .
My favourite sport is football , at first time i saw it nine years ago and i liked it so much .
It was game Chelsea against Bolton and Chelsea won 5 - 1 .
I got a lot of new fellings because i have never liked it ang never watched it befor .
I noticed that Lampard was a leader of that team and he scored two imes in that game .
Now , i have been supporting Chelsea fo nine years and i can assume that it was live from first sight .
My advise for peaople who plays is never give up playing and supporting that club which gave you chance to play an to be a part of that team .
Respect youa coach even if he is very strict .
You have to put a lot of efforts in this stuff if you want to reach your gols and aims .
You have to be ready to get throught a lot of traums and injuries and problems which you will meet on your road tu succes .
If you put a lot of efforts now , and be strong enough to get through you will be proud and achiev everything what you wanted to achiev .
Dear Thomas ,
Recently you asked me about a place you were about to visit .
I think there is a perfect spot for you !
In the heart of Katowice there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
This attic flat has been used as a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer Andrzej Urbanowicz who died a year ago .
The place hides a fascinating story of underground culture in Silesia .
For quite a long time ( especially in the 60s ) the studio was frequented by lots of bohemian artist where they could follow occult and Buddhist practices as well as paint some psychedelic pieces of art .
The apartment at some point is close to the famous Andy Warhol 's studio which was rent back in the 60s in New York City .
Urbanowicz had made a fantastic place full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and Far East atmosphere - there are loads of figurines , paintings , old lamps , carpets and … dolls reminding those from horror films such as " Child 's Play " .
Some time ago I took the opportunity and experienced this magical aura for myself .
Just for once , the apartment had been changed into a temporary cinema for those who came to see the film of Nina Menkes " The Fanthom Love " which fitted in with the surrounding just perfectly .
I must say I ca n't imagine a better place to feel and see the Silesian history of art so I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart .
Yours sincerely ,
Patrycja .
Experience the only thing is if you love what you do , because of this I have helped you to prepare your concert .
I can say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory , you have to like what you do , I helped with a lot of love because I admire the job .
I gathered a lot of experience from my expeditions through many countries and we were DJs clubs , and I felt so good when I saw that many people gather at my concert .
I try my best to make people feel good , have fun on my music ... What I can say is that I truly love what I do , and why I helped you with ease .
I hope you will go and tie and looking very well send me email back with your successful experiences .
In my area I collected all this experience and I feel happy man .
Now that I got away and I 'm a talented artist .
With respect , I welcome friend and again I say it was a pleasure to help you !
It is said that boxing should be banned , described as a barbaric sport , it has been known to lead to deaths and brain damage of fighters .
The constant pounding of the head during a match does n't necessarily do take it 's toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .
Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand , could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , children brought up to ' worship ' idols such as Frank Bruno , as he pummuls someone into a hazy blur .
Should boxing be banned .
My answer to all of these questions is no .
Maybe boxing is brutal , but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances .
Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death .
If boxing were banned where would we draw the line , skiing ?
mountaineering ?
diving ?
darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and a matter of personel opinion whether you watch it or no , boxing is usually on late at night , children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
I think boxing should be encourage , in run down inner cities areas such as Moss Side , boxing is popular , it gives young lads a focus in life , it gives them a target .
Many of the best boxers came from such areas , in my opinion they are better of boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs and shooting each other .
Banning boxing is simply unnecessary , if it were banned then it would simply continue ' underground ' .
This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control would n't be ensured , the use of pads may also be ignored .
The only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations , ie .
head guards and better gloves in all fights , or to shorten the length of fights to cut down some of the constant pounding .
Gaining entertainment !
Sports have been throughtout the history one of the many entertaining things to watch .
The international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention and I would like to present my life on a plate .
Firstly , most of us enjoy watching football .
Is there always someone who would not stop to comment upon the new situation happening unbelievebly in the match .
Even if I am a girl , football is one of the main sports I watch on TV .
My eyes sparkle when I wait for a score to end the match or when a red card is given unfairly .
The second one would be skiing .
I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practise it .
For them to be prepared for many obstacles and chasing around the time and finish line is amazing .
You need to focus , have a lot of energy and mostly strength .
Not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something to be recognized .
Are you thinking of an influence regarding the way sports developed ?
In my opinion , I think tradition remains even in the 21st century and sports differ from country to country .
On the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertain people from all over the world .
When the bank notes are made , firstly , background colour , artwork , and security issues should be designed carefully .
Then , skilled machinists manipulate the preparation of metal plates .
Waht 's more , printing is a very important step for thinking abount sheets , colour , special ink and so on .
While , the most important strp is inspection .
In this step , it would produce good quality sheets , bad sheets and partially damaged sheets .
The good parts of partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution with good quality sheets .
While the bad sheets and bad parts will be destroyed for disposal .
" Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . "
I denifitely agree with this statement .
We all are humans .
That means everyone deserves privacy .
It does not matter who are we , even in public life .
Film stars sometimes should be awarder for their patience in confrontation with journalists .
The spicy news about politician and other celebrities like film stars are most wanted in our today 's life .
The truth is that politicians should take a resonsibility for their decision in government and take into consideration words they say .
It also covers film stars , because it 's one of those things that they are the last word to young nation .
In my opinion there should be some hard borders that paparazzi can not cross .
They should n't hound celebrieties during their holidays or when they have some family problems or just problems on herself .
Today 's people are feeding with the gossip regards .
We live the 21st century so people who decide to be a public figure should be wilful of appearing the photographers and pushy paparazzi who wants to poke their noses into their intimacy by all means .
One of the most incredible 20th century discoveries , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .
Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time .
They are a complete luxury and not a necessity .
The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways : the main way being the availability to be reached at any time .
Communication is readily available in cars and on the streets now .
People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency ; if they are stranded or broken down .
They can take their cellular phones on vacations and to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call .
To me , it is a bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone .
Another way the cellular telephone has affected people 's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone .
When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .
This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them .
So , cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them .
Cellular telephones are also very expensive .
They are expensive to buy , to install and to use .
Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call , it costs a lot of money .
Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone , can afford to pay the bills !
The other day I called my father in his office , from Madrid - On his " party line " he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone .
I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with 4 people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car ! !
It is truly a mark of great expansion in technology .
Each year a new amazing product astonishes me even more .
I am starting to wonder when we will have robots cleaning our house and driving us around .
The scary thing is that it ' s just around the corner !
My most memorable was a trip to Hue with my family .
When I entered the University , my parents decided to present me a wonderful trip .
I felt so amazing because my family had interesting memories together .
I had one week at ancient city .
I visited in many sights in Hue such as peaceful Perfume River , Trang Tien Bridge , Thien Mu Pagoda and the like .
Moreover , I understood clearly about Vietnamese history through visiting beautiful tombs of Nguyen 's Kings .
Especially , I experienced in making " NonLa"- a beautiful symbol of Vietnamese people .
Hence , I knew one of the traditional crafts in Viet Nam .
Furthermore , I enjoyed a lot of dishes with ethnic flavor .
Besides , I had dinner in imperial boat and enjoyed Nha nhac cung dinh Hue .
It was recognized in 2005 by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity .
I prided of Vietnamese cultures .
This was excellent experiences to me .
Through of it , I 'd broaden my knowledge about its cultures , religions , customs and the like .
Special , It brought to me beautiful emotions and memories with my family .
Dear Sir / Madam ,

Network analyses in the political and economic researches : organizations and institutions
1 Basic network concepts ;
2 . Practical application .
Foresight of the development ;
3 . Software for interdisciplinary research .
Interdisciplinary network theory can be applied in a number of researches due to a large empirical orientation .
Flexibility is achieved by graph theory 's algorithm adapted to a lot of issues .
As a first example , we adapt the methodology and tools of network analysis in the concept of political networks to optimize the interaction of various international actors .
In the second case , we examine the results of network analyses of university 's partnership .

Over the past few years , our Monarchy has gone from one scandal to the next , from one disaster to another .
The British public has been made to realise that the Royal Family run just like any normal family , only with a lot more money .
Many people are now questioning the worth of even retaining the Monarchy .
Not so long ago , people thought that our royals were care free and lived ideal lives .
That way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah Ferguson into the family .
No sooner was she married to Prince Andrew , when things started to go wrong .
Public scandal surrounded their relationship and their break - up represented the start of a downhill run for the Monarchy .
Yet again only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife Princess Dianna have been given permission by the Queen to divorce , we have been shown that no family is perfect .
Their separation of course followed Charles ' affair with Camilla Parker Bowles .
So people say that we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one - another and lots of people certainly think that Prince Charles has no right to become king .
Many people argue that we can not afford a Monarchy , even though the Queen does now pay tax .
This was highlighted by the fire at Windsor Castle , for which the tax payer had to foot the bill .
I personally feel that we should retain the Monarchy .
They are our countrys heritage and other countries envy us for our Monarchy .
They give our country something to feel proud of , who has never dreamed of being a Royal ?
About me
Hi , I 'm Adal Reuterswärd and I 'm 13 years old , 14 in January .
I have two sisters , Siri , 11 years , and Lotte , 2 years old , she 's very annoying .
All of us were born here in Danderyd , but we moved here when I was 4 , and we have lived here since then .
Before that I think we lived in Sollentuna or something , I 'm not sure .
I love skiing , which I do 2 - 3 times a week , sometimes 4 .
But only in the winter of course . I also dance on Mondays , and then I do some practice at home , and I play the guitar .
Otherwise I love to paint and I watch a lot of TV shows , like Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee and more .
All of them are American so I 'm kind of used to it , so that 's what I like to speak .
My favorite is The Vampire Diaries , it 's the most exciting , but the next episode comes out I think October third so I have to wait ' till then .
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really like it there .
My grandparents live there , but they are n't from France , they just moved there .
I do n't know why , it 's a nice place I guess .
They moved there with my dad and their other daughter , my aunt , when dad was like 14 or something .
My favorite book I think has to be all the Harry Potter books . I read them a couple of years ago and after I 've read the first book we watched the first movie and then the same thing with the second and so on .
I 'm thinking of reading the books and watch the movies again because I barely remember anything .
But I remember thinking they were so exciting and after I 've read the last book I thought I would never find a good book again .
Which I did , but none quite as good as Harry Potter .
I like to listen to a group called Skyscraper , four boys from different places in Sweden , and I like Lucy Hale , an actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first album .
My favorite song of hers is the song called Road Between .
I also like Ariana Grande and I 'm listening a lot to her new album .
At first , transport is very important means in our daily life . We will talk about the gradient of transport means .
At the past the only transport means was riding horses and camels and donkeys and there are no mechanical means . but riding animals was more safely means than means of these days as there is no vehicle exhaust which pollute our public atmosphere , and these animals ' dung is useful as fertile materials for the farmland .
Transport was evolved gradually till reached the bikes and carts then to Cars with engines .
Today all the people use engines vehicles like Motorcycle , Cars , Trains and planes .
As well as this means are very faster than the last means , but this means pollute our atmosphere .
As vehicles exhausts hart our hearts , affect our breathe , widen the Ozone Hole , cause a lot of noise and cause traffic jam .
But people do n't concern with these dangers and they concerned only with their luxuries and comfortableness . I think that there is no new mean will be invented .
People have satisfied with engines means like cars .
One of the most significant inventions of the 20th century has to do with the speed at which information is now communicated throughout the globe .
In fact , all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives .
If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention of the field , it would have to be the television .
Through the television , news and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening .
This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live , and in a way it has , and continues to shrink the planet we live on .
There are , however , several downsides to the television , and , like all inventions can be used in a useless way .
Not even truly dealing with the amount of television that is watched by the average person , there are several other important ways that television had changed people 's lives .
One interesting development has been the use of television in wars .
The vietnam war was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war .
This was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting .
We are able also to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and effort , for instance , in Somalia .
Of course radio was already able to transmit the sound , but the coming of the picture has had even more significance .
The greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions of the planet .
Gone are the days of unknown and unheard of areas .
Television is able to bring any part of the world into your very living room within a matter of seconds .
It is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way in which to communicate with populations .
There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , and this is true .
It is also used in ways that can desensitize one 's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real .
Either way , however , that it is used , there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century .
The truth is we are all different .
I ca n't speak for others , but in my experience I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .
First of all because probably most of us do n't know what to do with our lives , or we just do what other people told us to do , especially our parents .
Second , because it is healthy to travel , get to know new cultures and new traditions .
But you can do other stuff like working , save money for college or for a new business .
Also if you already work before you will have more experience than others , it gives you a plus .
You will become more independent and more conscious of life in general .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He had to escape as fast as he could .
The police alarm could be heard in all the street .
So , he knew that the police was near .
Michael threw the knife he had on his hand to the bush in front of the house .
He ran faster than ever .
Suddenly , he heard some dogs barkering .
At that moment he started felling really nervous .
He hide under a big car and wait there .
He was afraid and worried about what had happened .
He did n't want to kill his ex girlfriend .
But Michael had no choice .
Anne had broken up with him for something stupid and irrelevant .
She deserved that .
After a few minutes he saw someone going into the car where he was hiding .
If he escape the person will see him .
Before he could do something the car started and it was too late to leave .
Television is a subtle magic boxes which enlightens our life .
From the screen , audiences can raise their awareness on events happening in the globe .
Or they can find themselves a spectrum of emotion which they might not experience in their daily life by watching different movies .
Truly Television symbolizes a dramatic advance on today 's entertainment .
Nevertheless , it can also be billed as a way of education .
Nowadays when people mention about education , our mind comes an idea in which we sit in front of books with teachers or computers aside .
Most books are an inches in thickness .
And each sides of that are filled with black - and - white images followed by colorless description aside .
Only by our mind can we imagine objects or ideas described in it .
Televisions , on the other hand , offer a much colorful learning experience by merely a screen .
Items had been categorized according to their attributes .
Theories and models try to consolidate with each other for explaining one of the variances among world .
For television , however , objects can be expressed in a real life manner .
Audiences are able through observation to understand the variety of the surrounding from time to time , as well as the correlations between matters .
They are given the whole picture and process of our environment , not a photo .
The lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem as more people complain about their bad relationships with others at work and the poor performance they have , therefore using inadequate lighting is the main reason for it .
First of all , not using natural light in the workplace can deteriorate , in a small , but considerable way , the health of the employees and this is because the neon lights can affect the eyes and can also lead to headaches if they are used for a long period of time .
As a result of suffering headaches , the workers have more chances of feeling nervous and anxious and their performance at work might decrease .
Secondly , as a consequence of being in a bad mood , there is the possibility of having a lack of co - operation and not being able to concentrate and focus for what it has to be done which also affects the productivity and the well development at the workplace .
As a conclusion , there are many reasons which sustain the need for the employees of having access to the natural light while doing their jobs , because the lack of it can have negative effects , both on people and productivity , so it should be taken into consideration and there should be found a solution for solving the issue .

Fame is an asset for every celebrity .
Broadly speaking , being famous is being well - known and much of effort is used to achieve that popularity , to be recognised instantly on a TV screen .
It may seem that the image of a person even lives separate life from a person who created it , but it is not actually true .
There are several reasons why the image overlaps its creator .
One is that usually one and the same actor is representing one and the same character in succession of films so that actor blends with his or hers character .
Also , sometimes a reverse of the situation occurs , when actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role in a film or play and becomes associated with that only role .
In short , actors become associated with their roles and it is not easy for them to change their well - known image even in everyday life .
Regarding other socially - oriented celebrities other issues arise .
For politicians keeping high profile is essential because they are known in conjunction with their actions .
As for journalists it is essential to appear in their programmes to become recognizable .
Overall , these celebrities use their visual image as a brand for what they do .
To sum up , the attention to a celebrity is a good sign for him or her and it means that this person really is famous .
Regardless of their will , they would be pestered by some journalists and their lives would also be in the limelight because it is what people want to know - that is how being a celebrity works .

Today most people think that after - school sports club are necessary .
However connected are with it advantages and disadvantages .
I present it in my essay .
I ask my young friends their opinion on after school sports and some tell me that is good and some that no .
In the first place , I must say that when young people are taking sport certainly they are healthier , athletic and of course fit so if you want to be fit you should take up sport .
Disadvantages of taking sport are is it for example that if you have injury you ca n't be active and your weight in fast will be much larger .
Secondly , when you are excersing or playing you have adrenalin rush and you feel excited so you are self- confident and it for sure i effects on relations with other people .
Unfortunately you have shortage of time to study because you spend time at the gym or pitch .
Another important aspects is it that you will be person who ensures a good team spirit but also when you are in a team you sometimes you can argue .
All in all , I still think that after- school sports clubs it a good idea .
In my class most students says that sports is great .
Healthy and young people
Young people are less healthy now than twenty years ago according studies appears recently in newspapers .
One reason for this it 's that young people prefer to play video games to play outdoors because it 's more popular or for example because they are n't used to play football with their parents in the street .
Besides , young people eat too much junk food and they 're less willing to do sports which require more effort .
If I were a politician , I 'd encourage people to do exercise outdoors , and I 'd build sports centre where you would n't have to pay .
In my opinion junk food should be more expensive , so people would n't buy so much .
When you start doing exercise soon you feel better and you ca n't stop .
Kaplan outside area
Introduction
The purpose of this report is discuss how Kaplan College should spend a large amount of money to improve its outside area .
Build a garden
Every Kaplan 's students know that behind Kaplan 's building has a useless place where the College can spend on to build a nice and beautiful garden .
This place does not have useful for everyone , so will be awesome to invest in a garden , which all the students could use and relax on the free time .
Food and Drink
The College need to invest in some nice and healthy restaurants surround Kaplan , because many students have been complaining about the food and drink that they have to buy at school or outside area .
I heard a student saying that around Kaplan just have junk food restaurants .
They should spend on some nice , healthy and cheap restaurants on outside area of Kaplan .
Recommendation
I recommend spending a lot of money to build a garden and some good restaurants around Kaplan College .
These improvement would increase the quality and behaviour of students work .
These would have a beneficial effect on all students .
Personally , I think people 's lives will change no matter what we do .
And there is nothing we can do about it .
But what we can do is decide if that change will be for the best or not .
Sounds very easy , simple but it is not .
We do n't make changes , changes are the result of the decisions that we make , changes are the consequences of our actions .
And one of the biggest changes that we can see nowadays is how blind we , humans , are about everything that surrounds us .
We go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expenses , personal issues , that we do n't take notice about what surrounds us .
We do n't notice other people , we do n't communicate with each other .
Lost in our minds , in our cellphones , in our earphones .
And this is a consequence of the bad use that we gave and give to technology . which fifty years from now would lead to another big change .
It 's like a vicious chain .
Fifty years from now people wo n't know how to talk to each other .
We will lose our socials abilities .
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to explain how are the most important aspects of the environment in my city .
BACKGROUND
Treviso is situated in the north of Italy and it had been ruined during the II War World .
CHANGES
After being rapidly rebuilt and renovated Treviso has become a modern city .
It is easy to reach by train , rail and air ; it has been an increasing of the population thanks to the growth of industry and all these matters have determinate the enhancement of problems concerning the environment .
DEVELOPMENTS
People interviewed at the front door of the main public building as Town hall , schools , etc . , have stated that they feel , on average , happy about how the diligence had dealt with problems involved from the new aspect of the town , in particular regarding the following subjects :
- Air , light , noise pollution : about the 80% of citizens declared that they feel very satisfied with these problems due to the fact that in the centre city cars are not allowed to transit ; public lights are powered by solar panel and moreover the Major has signed an agreement with the Union builders that obliged them to realise public parks every areas with 1000 thousand of people .
- Recycling : all families are provided of three litter bins in which they have to recycle rubbish and at school children are concerned about the subject since the primary school .
CONCLUSION
Treviso can offer high standard of life quality and people are aware of the result of this aim is something to achieve together .
A historical place in Sweden I would say is the royal castle .
It 's in the capital of Sweden , Stockholm .
It 's big , beautiful and contains a lot of history .
The royal castle was rebuilt in 1697 after a fire .
It wash't in use until 1754 and it was n't finished until 1770th .
Since then not much have been rebuilt .
On the inside there have been some changes and modernist to fit the royal family , and some painting on the fasade on the outside .
Some museums have been added and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there but it would be interesting to go sometime .
An invention of the 20th century which I feel has significantly changed people 's lives is the introduction of Bank - cash machines or Automatic teller machines .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenience at access to money in emergencies or cases when money is needed .
It is also a convenience which helps to save time , which is very important to working men and women of the late 1900 's .
This machinery also permits you to do your banking when you wish rather than the assigned banking hours .
People may argue that ATM machines will take away employment in banks but we must also focus on the positive aspects .
ATM machines appear in all areas of the World .
In the United States for example you can find machines in stores , movie theatres , parking lots at shopping malls , and at banks .
In many situations I have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store .
This is when I really appreciate my ATM card .
Another advantage of the card is the danger of having large quantities of cash in your home or wallet .
This entices robbers and can promote danger .
All in all , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . The convenience has proved itself in many circumstances and I do not know what I would do without my card . -- The development of computerized technology has enhanced our environment providing convenience and time saving activities which reduce the stress of our every day life .
The Amazon Lava Lizards are pretty hard to see .
When you saw one probably it already saw you .
I noticed in field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juveniles , the imature males and the females .
The adult males seemed to be in the same place always .
However , I ca n't confirm that were the same males on the same places .
The smaller individuals had a tendency to ran away quickly when noticed someone coming .
Also , they commonly back to the same place just after flee .
The lizards can stand still for a long time with few movements , usually of the head .
The big ones showed more communicative displays like headbobs and push - ups .
The boardwalk was the only point where I saw more than one animal which could interact to each other .
On other places when there are more than one animal they are away one another and did n't interact .
The animals which use the boardwalk was most exposed than the animals of the other points .
The animals which I observed among the vegetation were usually sheltered either by a dense shrub or bush vegetation , or on a bromeliad leaf that had spikes in the edge .
The distance to cause flee in these animals was larger than the boardwalk lizards .
" I feel like I should tell her the truth and beg for her forgiveness " , Mark said to Michael .
Their friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few days and she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
He agreed to it , but he did n't really pay too much attention to the doors of his house being properly shut , so the animal escaped . "
Jules is nowhere to be found " , he sighed .
" I 'm just going to buy her a huge flowers bouquet and hope she does n't take it too hard " .
Michael , however , thought his friend was overreacting . "
I 'll fix this for him since he 's too stupid to fix it himself " , he thought .
He went into the first pet shop he found and bought a Siamese cat which he thought looked identical to the one entrusted to Mark . "
Dear Jenny , sorry I 'm having Jules delivered to you , but I 'm busy and ca n't drop him off myself .
Love , Mark " , he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
The next day , there was a loud thumping on the door .
It was Mark , and he was furious . "
Did you really think that Jenny would n't notice that it is n't her cat ?
And how dare you use my name on that card ?
Now , she does n't want to talk to me ever again !
And neither do I ever want to talk to you again ! " , he shouted as he quickly made his way off the porch .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A film I want to recommend for our student club is the captain america and the winter soldier , it have a lot of adrenaline and emotions .
This film was launched on the 13 of march and it was a big succed .
Using Global Positioning System , GPS , is popular in the modern world although GPS does not work that well in areas where the GPS signal is interfered .
Consequently indoor navigation with GPS is not that good .
This paper aims to propose an alternative method to GPS to be used in indoor environments .
The methods developed in this paper uses only the position of the Wireless Access Points , WAP : s , and the signal strength , RSSI , recorded by the user in order to calculate the position of the device .
Since today 's computers and cellphones contains all the required hardware , a future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost effective .
One of the methods proposed in this paper usually gives the user a position that is about five meters wrong .
Therefore this method can not be used when a more precise estimation is needed .
However a weighted average of these three methods together with different similar methods might enhance the accuracy .
At the beginning it is worth to think over what the phenomenon of shopping is .
Some people claim that doing a shopping deliver them a lot of pleasure .
Recently I met with example of woman who maintained that spending money helps her to calm down .
yes .
In my family , there are five people my dad , mum , older sister and younger brother .
All of them who always talk , share and support everything for me .
They are not only my family members but also are best friends .
When i was a child , my dad or mum usually took me to school by motorbike , i have beautiful memories for those of time .
They bought for me all nice things that useful for studying , and made me interested in study .
When i got bad score , they did not blame me , instead they always said : " we count on you " , thus i never felt scare or worry whenever i did wrong thing and that made me so confident .
I often told them my story before went to sleep , whatever , like how i make friends with boy in class , how i got over a dog on the road , etc .
but after growing up , i was not so close with my parents , i have many activities outdoor with my siblings as exercise , travel ...
in that time , we get over all problem and get more understand each other .
So now i am oversea and i always think about my family as my best friends ever .
Hi , Dear Hanna
Last summer I was worked at the cinema it was very good experience for me I enjoy so much because a met o lot of peoples from different country and culture I worked there about three month and the pay it was satisfactory , in the cinema a learned a lot name 's films what I do n't hear before my colleagues it was very kind and friendly and after we finished our job still we are e good friend and spent time together going out for drink and sometimes for dinner .
I hope next year to do a same job because I love it and hope to do what again
In future , public transport is no longer required as " owning your own vehicle " becomes very common .
The justifications behind are :
1 . The advanced technology reduces the costs of manufacturing and maintaining an automobile to a very affordable level ;
2 .
Recognizing transportation as a necessity in daily life , the governments will provide subsidies to their residents who can not afford owning a car .
Under the future social welfare scheme , a person who is earning an annual income below a specific threshold will be provided a car at no charge at all ; in addition to that , all the related maintenance cost such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and tuning will be reimbursed by the government .
3 . There is no need to get a driving licence for operating a car .
With the assistance of advanced global position system technology , we can just simply voice input the place we would like to go to , and the car will automatically bring you there at ease .
When the day of " no public transport " will come ?
We can not tell at this moment , but one thing is for sure - technology keeps changing our life and mode of living .
The airport of my city is not very far from my home but , at the same time , is not easy to reach the city .
The more comfortable way is to have a private car with which is possible to take the highway and then the direction for the centre of the city .
My home is close to the central rail station and the most important buses stop of the metropolitan area .
As second option there is a railway service from the airport to a secondary rail station .
Here you have to get off and then to take a bus , the number 25 , with which is possible to arrive in the centre of the city from where I can reach my home by foot .
Another possible option is to use a taxi service but , in this case , the cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
The two best choice to return at home from the airport is to use the private car or to use the railway airport service with a very cheap service : I spend a bit of time and money more but the journey is nice and comfortable like the same trip with the private car .
I am a hight and blonde girl who loves all spots but my favorite is basketball .
I enjoy this sport because is very dinamic , teach me many things such us being polite and very responsible and above all is a group game and i love working as a team .
I would like to give one advice to someone who wants to start practicing this sport that is always work as a team , that is not only think in yourself always think of the best for the team .
The dorbell rang .
When I opened the door , imagine my surprise when I saw that my brother 's foot was covered in blood .
I was really upset .
He came in , and I helped him .
I told him that he must go to the hospital to take care of his foot but he did n't listen .
He was afraid that if he went to the hospital , our parents would find out about this .
I asked him how this happened and he told me that he fell off his motorcycle .
That 's when I realised what was going on .
He did n't want our parents to know , because his godfather had just bought him the motorcycle and our mother was against this but he did keep it on one condition , that he would be really careful .
I told him , that we had to go to the hospital , even if that meant that our parents were gon na take his motorcycle away .
He understood that he had no choice , so he agreed .
I called my mum and told her everything that happened .
She came over our house and took my brother to the hospital .
I was really worried , but hopefully everything was alright .
The pie chart depicts different proportion of fuel type that generate energy in Florida 2007 compared with the forecast for 2017 .
Overall , it is clear that Natural gas is the main energy generator for both years , while Renewables and Oil come at the bottom of the list .
For example , the energy generated by Natural gas increased from 38.8% in 2007 to 54.4% in 2017 .
Next comes the energy production by Coal which accounts for 29.3% of the energy market in 2007 , followed by a drop of 5.6% in the forecasted year of 2017 .
As for Nuclear , although it represents the third energy generator in Florida for both compared years , the trend here is upwards reaching 15.9% at the estimated period .
In contrast , there is a significant drop in the energy production for both Oil and Other sources in the two separate years from 6.7% to 1.1% for the former and 11.1% to 3.4% for the latter .
As for the Renewables , the decrease in fuel generated over the period is less dramatic .
There are some reasons to explain how Venus is shine so brighly according to the text .
In addiction of these reasons , in the passage there is an information about Venus temperature , and the listen passage can refuse some information that is express in the text .
Some questions are done during the listen to expand the information about this planet .
How Venus can be so hot if it is recovered by thick white clouds , it should be could , should n't it ?
There is another doubt about this high temperture : there is a planet closer to the sun , that is hotter than Venus , so , it is n't hot because of your localization near .
The most amazingly question is : How it can be hot in a place that sulfiric acid prevents the sun to inside in ?
The listen passage could link the information in the text , and estimulated some questions , and also give the answers to get the reader more curious , about the topic .
There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK .
The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety .
Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London , Greater Manchester and Birmingham .
The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger .
However this , as seen in recent events for example Newbury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .
another way to reduce congestion , especially in the large cities , could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all .
Introducing schemes such as the ' park - and - ride ' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
Safety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads .
Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads .
There are several ways to combat this problem .
Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport .
Increasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective , giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines .
Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern .
It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better , especially in winter .
This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government .
Safety is much less of a factor for rail transport .
Here the major talking point is efficiency .
It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time .
Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport , cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option .
A large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese ' bullet ' train .
The train tracks can also be blamed , as they are often in a state of repair and this inevitably delays trains .
It is hoped that the recent privatisation of British Rail will bring in more up to date trains and increase the overal efficiency of travelling by train is a bid to attract much more customers .
The author in reading part thought technology brings us more comfortably live .
The author took an example ; one is we do n't have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone discovered how to use fire , second is we do n't have to live in cave anymore .
However , the professor disagree with the author .
She thinks technology not all lets us better , oppositely it lets us more worse .
She said technology brings us weak relationship with family or friends .
And then it even lets our circumstance more worse because it takes a lot of pollution .
Final , the professor suggests that we have to reduce using technology .
If we reduce using it , we will have a good relationship and best environment .
Apparently , the author did n't notice about the bad influence from technology .
In this essay I will put forward and briefly break down the controversy which involves problems realted to zoos .
As a controversial topic , there are arguments for and against it .
Depending on the point of view that each person might take , the argument they will give .
It is very likely that animals in zoos suffer from not being in its natural habitat , being stared almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably and the natural peace they need to live .
Furthermore , it is also but not only important to say that the fact that its animals live in groups and in contrast of that , in zoos its number is limited to a few of them .
Nevertheless , for society and especially for children is very useful to have the possibility of going and experience the visit to a zoo .
If it were not because of the zoos it would be practically impossible that wild animals could be known by the majority of the population .
It experience provide a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for the big ones , such as vets , Scientifics and why not anthropologists too .
All in all , it would be difficult to take a fair solution , or almost to provide a solution which would deal with both opposites ' sides of the topic in question .
In my personal opinion , I rekoned Safari parks would be a solution in the middle of these opposites ' sides ; it would provide better quality of life to animals and would be educational way as well .
Firstly what is European Union ?
It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most ; Political Union , followed by Economic and Monetary Union .
In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead to many disputes within the present government .
They also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher .
In losing her , have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty ?
Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back , " not letting socialism in by the back door " , instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community .
Great Britain can not afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present , and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes .
So , a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable , whether we like it or not .
On monetary and economic Union , I do n't feel that we have much to lose ; in fact on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously , especially in the light of 1992 .
If only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would give their agreement .
After all , how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international Stock Exchanges of New York , Tokyo and Frankfurt ?
Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference ?
Did not the " Big Bang " in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plummeting ?
World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked ; the effects of which often see no physical borders .
I therefore see this European Unity as a natural process in World development , something which should be made easier rather than hindered .
Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ?
The issue of Political Union is still more disputed .
Yes , we have a Queen and what would happen to her - would she be forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?
This is a very typical misinformed and ignorant statement posed by certain British " patriots " .
There are five other Monarchs in the European Community and their statuses to a great extent will not be greatly affected by any such Union .
But there is a true cause for concern about Brussels'bureaucracy which rightly worries the British public .
This situation must be changed to rid the Council of its secrecy and to transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system .
This will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on - something which must be guaranteed for such independant thinkers as the Britons themselves .
An answer to Britains reservation on European Unity , which I find most plausible at present ; a Federal Union which would ensure decisions where possible would be taken at local levels .
This , if properly carried out would enable us to keep our cultural identity - the ultimate element of our sovereignty .
Dementia is a kind of normal disease for elder population .
And it is difficult to be cured by human , so that robotics are used to help them .
For this case , at this monument research reported that :
Social commitment robots are designed to promote therapeutic interactions through
communication and social interaction .
The therapeutic use of the robots attempts to
reach out to people affected by dementia and may provide an alternative mode of
engagement with this population .
( Mordoch et al , 2013 , p. 15 )
Consequence , these robotics offer the benefit to patients who associated with personal interactions , enable them be pleasure and relaxed .
Especially , in Japan , are keen on using the robotic to care aging population , the reason for this is that home cares or hospitals can not allow animals assisted therapy to enter .
Unlike Japan , in North American , people prefer to use animal assisted therapy , but the use of robotics is less than animals .
I 've been member of the Active Leisure Club since 7th April 2013 and I 'm really pleased with your letter , because it means that you care about your customers .
What I really appreciate is the staff qualification , particularly of the fitness ' courses and their punctuality .
This aspect is really important for working people .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness of the environments : everything is always perfect and I often see showers being sanitized and people do have respect of every common spaces .
I also have some suggestions .
It would be really useful having some hairdryers in the locker rooms : in this way people could have a complete service and could arrive at home relaxed or ready to go out .
Another service that could make you competitive with other centres would be having a massage room : after any sports it would be nice to have a personal masseur who takes care of your tired body !
Anyway , I 'm really glad to have a leisure club in my city that helps me to keep fit !
Thank you for your interest .

MARY JAMES
Mary James and I have met at Marianista school .
We have gone to secondary school together and we have been friends for 5 years , so we know each other very well .
When Mary was at Secondary school , she proved herself to be a brilliant student .
She not only was competent , but also hard - working and that was reflected on her high grades .
Nevertheless , she was not boastful , and in contrast , she would help other students who had some difficulties with the subjects .
She was appreciated by students and teachers because of her kindness and her willingness to help .
Mary is extremely loyal to her friends .
She is also caring and supportive and she knows exactly what to say when you are going through a tough situation .
Moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , and whenever she sets an objective she accomplishes it .
When Mary was a student , she was very self - demanding , who wished to do everything perfect and , as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
However , as years went by , she managed to handle those situations , as she learnt to how organize and do her tasks in a more efficient way .
Mary was always interested in British culture and therefore she has studied English for several years and she has read many books about Great Britain .
As she has finished high school , her intention is to pursue a career and she is looking for a possibility that would enable her to achieve her goal as well as develop her English - speaking skills .
It is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would suit her undoubtedly and I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Yours faithfully ,

Would you like to find out the best place for our last dinner ?
Firstly , we must look for a restaurant special for groups , due to we are a large number of people .
If we go a normal restaurant , we will dislike the treatment .
I am sure there are some restaurants where we would be able to go .
I am going to explain what is my favourite for this special occasion .
I suggest ' Pommodoro ' .
This is an Italian restaurant , which is located in the city centre .
Both characteristics are the most important for me .
First of all , this kind of food likes most of the people , such as pizza or maccaroni .
Also , the location is perfect because we can arrive easily , walking or by bus .
After dinner , we may to go to some discos or pubs .
Besides , this restaurant has a delightful decoration .
It seems you are sitting in a roman theatre .
The waiters are from Italy , so they may talk with us in Italian , which it would very useful for practising this language .
In conclusion , I would recommend this restaurant .
It is the ideal place for us , a big place , delicious food and the location , of course .
Nowadays , film stars , musicians , politicians , models live in the limelight .
Some of them want it and some of them are less enthusiastic about being in the centre of attention .
Journalists often follow them all the time .
In my opinion celebrities have a right to private life , but as long as they do n't tell everything about themselves in the tabloids .
First of all , everyone has a right to privacy .
Being a famous artist or politician is unusual job , but still only a job , and after the job everyone wants to have their own life .
From the other hand being a superstar it 's almost impossible to have a private life .
Well - known people are frequently in touch with their fans and most public know them very well .
In my point of view everyone has a right to privacy with no exceptions .
Journalists which follow the celebrities just cross the line .
The paparazzi often exceed the limit of privacy .
We do n't have to know everything about them , for example , hair condition of some actress when she was shopping .
Superstars also deserve to have their own life , no one deserves to be followed or spied .
Colombia 's army is a good stereotype to other armies in Latin America even other armies of the world .
Even so , many Colombians do not know the hard work of their soldiers day by day must be made for the only purpose of protecting our lives and guarantee democracy for alll of us .
Therefore , it is necessary to know why Colombian 's army has this distinction .
First , the military forces of Colombia have 438.700 effectives , being the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil .
On the other hand , Colombian 's army is regarded as one of the best armies in the world due to its internal conflict , that keeps the soldiers in action and constant training , even in Colombia are training other Latin American armies from Africa and the Middle East because of the war Anti- terrorist that develops the Colombian armed forces for 40 years these have been strengthened in a masterly manner , by its preparation , intelligence and modern tactic aids .
Second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in anti - terrorism struggle such as : foil terrorist attacks , neutralize explosive devices left in urban areas and rural , prevent the recruitment of children , realizing medical brigades for helping farmers and the most important , offer their lives if it 's necessary to protecting each and every one of us , even without knowing us .
Finally , I could say that the hard work and the good image that has the Colombian 's army just reflect our wish to living in peace .
likewise , all the Colombian people want to reach its dreams in a pacific way , without weapons or fights between brothers and so , show the world that the Colombian people are brave enough to fight for peace .
Dear Paul ,
What 's up ? .
Sorry I did n't answer your letter earlier .
I was really busy because of organization the next concert .
By the way , your VIP tickets wait in the drawer in my desk .
As you asked me , I 'll write you something about helping Kokon 's concert which took place last month .
It was a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything .
Just at the beginning I had a problem with the owner of the pub .
He was n't convinced that we 'll be able to sell as many ticktes to pay for the pub .
He did n't know the band , was really sceptical about it .
But , you know , where there 's a will there 's a way and at last I won him over .
When he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see how things are working he was just speechless with surprise .
His pub was full of people ( as never before ) .
I did n't told him that ever though Kokon is quite underground band , it has so many fans ! .
His face expression almost kill me when I saw it .
It was mix of outrage because of crowd in his pub and happiness because of money they spend on beer .
And how about athe concert ?
Was incredible .
Although I had to take care of everything I could have a great time too .
We are planning next events with the Kokon 's leader .
I 'll let you know about concerts coming up this month .
Just tell me when you are going to come back to Bytom .
Kisses ,

She started its live with so many problems , and after every sadness period , she discovers that she has enough capability to continue .
But the most difficult thing of her perspective when she is exposed to lose some one , how ever she had losing much people at varying circumstance , but she never used to the feeling of losing , and she pains each time such as the first time .
She experiences the travelling , and she attempts to leave every things which causes her sadness , she tries to keep away from politic , and removes the military and weapons image from her mind , but the humans ' blooding have chased her .
she was writing about each important event .
I think that nowadays the most people use little the public transport .
I understand that the car is more comfortable and safe to travel and to make short trip however these is more dangerous the environment .
People of some countries use a different transport , for example the bike or train to move for the city .
Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes .
Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and there is a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans .
The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study , and indeed he may , there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
And indeed this fear is justified .
When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered .
But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon .
We can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject .
But are we right to blame him ?
Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering .
It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask , should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences .
Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world ?
In truth no , it is unreasonable .
Genetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin .
The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down 's Syndrome .
There is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones .
Some of these may seem a little far fetched but it is conceivable that in a 100 years time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child , whether he is a great piano player or sportsman .
It does not seem morally right to be able to make these decisions and certainly to anyone religious would be seen to be interfering in the ways of god and something to be avoided at all costs .
A great scientist can not see into the future .
He can not gage the moral repurcusions of his discovery nor the long term effect it is going to have on the world .
If he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause who are we to criticise him when we know far less about it .
Provided a scientists work has been permitted and is public I feel it is unjust to hold him responsible for what the wold will make of his work .
To avoid continually writing he / she , his / her the scientist in this essay has been referred to as he .
I hope no offence is taken from this .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing in response to the invitation to share my experience on making a hard decision that appeared in the July issue of your English - language magazine .
As a nineteen - years - old student I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of studies was i going to choose .
First of all , I strongly believe that making choices is always risky as people do not know what the exact result will be .
Like most adolescents I was at a total loss when the time of deciding what I wanted to be in the future came .
In despair I applied for two courses of studies , which did not resemble at all , what made the moment of choosing a lot harder .
Knowing that not only was this choice a fundamental decision , but it was also one that will influence the rest of my adulthood , I appealed for help in what should I focus at the moment of making my decision .
As time passed by , I was to attend more and more classes .
I could not cope with such busy timetable and consequently I was exhausted and stressed .
A decision had to be made before I dropped out of both courses of studies .
I bore in mind the pieces of advice I was given and chose what made me happy despite not having the approval of some of my relatives .
I am convinced that stark choices are unavoidable but in order to not regret the consequences they might have , either positive or negative , people should choose what make them happier .
However , I have not gave for granteed that my decision will not make me regret .
If this were the case , I know that I am always on time of starting again .
For the above mentioned reasons , I think choices have to be carefully considered before being made .
Even though this not assure the results .
I look forward to following subsequent articles on related issues .
Yours faithfully ,
Vilma Rossit
There are many standards by which success and hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past .
In earlier times people had the lifestyle of fending for themselves .
They were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present society .
Because of the differences in personalities and ambition , I feel it is vital that in today 's society men and women should be financially reward for their individual efforts .
In a society each person has the same basic needs for survival .
Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up of majority of each person 's day .
In order to feed your family you had to plant .
In order to live you had to build .
To have clothing , you had to sew .
Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs .
Even in early times the harder you worked , the more food , shelter or clothing you gained .
This is a very simple support of reward equaling effort .
Bringing this to a more present time , we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology , expanding knowledge , and modern times .
We have many machines to held us meet our food , clothing and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part , it would appear .
Persons with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor .
However , just as in earlier days , the harder you work , the greater the reward .
Let 's imagine a society where all men and women were treated equal .
All basic survival needs ( and even wants for that matter ) were provided regardless of the effort put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced of a society as we are today .
Competitiveness and jealously would set in and fights would occur .
Worst case scenario : the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone was sitting on the sidelines and not doing their share .
We would not have motivation to develop our talents and abilities and to use them in a way to benefit others .
Our society would become selfish and hoarding and our culture would suffer .
It may be a pessimistic view , but I feel a very real view , to say that we would become lazy and stagnate people .
Life is about rewards .
It is about learning where you are and how you can move yourself to the next level .
Each of us is measured daily by some scale of achievement .
Effort is vital to success , motivation is the key to effort .
Some are content with needs , others want more , much more !
Our system of rewards is money ... but is it really about money ?
I do n't think so .
It 's about meeting needs ( and even wants ! ) and how much one is willing to give for the opportunity for something better .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
My name 's Ciprina Pires and I have 17 years old .
I 'm writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a jog on a summer camp in the USA and I would like to make my application for the job .
I like to work with children between 8 - 12 years old because they have energy for everyone and might understand some of the activities that we will be given to them .
Normally , I like to organise activities for others and they might be interesting and different .
I love organise evening activities more than the other ones because they are more excited and more enthusiastic .
Now , I have been cooking to my family and I love it , and I would love to cooked for 100 of people .
I can speak English enough that all the person can understand , I 'm energetic , hardworking and cheerful .
................
Yours sincerely ,
Ciprina
The impact on modern biology was enormous and for this reason , in 1993 the inventor was awarded with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry .
For this invention Mullis received a bonus of $ 10000 from the company he was working for , but in a short time the rights to use the process made the company 300 million dollars !
The television is , for many people , the main way to spend their free time .
Children stay , in a day , more than one hour watching the television .
Parents are worried about what their children watch because they think that their sons do not learn anything , it only entertains .
It is far from really .
If we choose the correct programs we could make them to teach us a lot inadvertently .
There are a lot of documentaries about the environment , animals , human body , etc who are very interesting and entertaining .
Cartoons can be put into English or other languages to improve them .
The TV can be used to leave blank mind or full the brain with a lot of useful knowledge .
Now the stone is on their roofs .
Plastic bags are banned in the city .
Town council are planting more trees .
Solar heater has been introduced in the houses instead of water heater .
Rain water storage system to increase water level .
Human wastage are properly handled by town council .
Government are encouracing people to use public transport instead of car .
Using cycle is more friendly envirentmetal vehicle .
LED lights are introduced to reduce electricity usage .
Change is always good .
It is widely accepted that change is an essential motor of progress .
In fact , for many people , without changes , mankind would live still as in prehistory , without fire , wheels , or even comfortable houses . We would live in caves , would n't we ?
We would only eat that our men would hunt .
We would wear animal leather .
Oh !
What a ridiculous drawing !
But in my opinion the problem is more complex .
Conservative people , for instance , usually are reluctant to change , because in general they are afraid of changing , probably because they prefer bad things but sure things .
In addition , if you have a glance to the history , in spite of times of revolution usually are traumatic , humanity tends to improve after them .
The question is if convulsion , violence , and wars that often changes need to be done really whorth ?
It is often said that public transport is bound to disappear since most people seem to be pleased to use their own car for nearly every journey they take .
This might probably be true for the majority of people .
Sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer travelling by car to using public transport . Travelling by car offers many advantages .
For instnace , you can decide exactly the time you want to leave , and the place you want to leave from .
Yo do not have to share your journey with anybody if you do not want to and you can get to the exact point where you want to be .
Everything about cars seems to be an advantage .
So , why does public transport still exist ?
To begin with , because not everybody can own a car .
But even if everybody could , it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big city , such Barcelona , by car .
I do not think there would be enough space for so many vehicles , not only to park but also to circulate on the road .
Moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anybody could survive it .
The future
The problems of this plant are increasing every day and people ask themselves : What will the future be like in 30 years ?
We think that the world will be destroyed .
At first many kind of plant species will have become extinct , 90% percent of fauna will be endangered .
After that food will have become insufficient to satisfy society demands and people will be dying of starvation . Diseases will be more common and a lot of people will have died due to epidemics .
An appreciable part of society will have been diagnosed with cancer .
Living in egalitarian society people will be collaborating to save the world , we will be using robots to clean the planet , the scientists will be design especial clothes to avoid radiation , and people will be using oxygen tanks .
Living in our actual society divided in social status .
Poor people will be living in the trash and rich people will be living inside of spacecraft .
There will be wars in order to get water .
Once you became famous probably you will definitely know the taste and the price of fame .
There are many people in my country , who keep thinking that being a famous person to some extent is a blessing .
Such person is known for most of the people within national or even international rate .
Some believe that there are many advantages of being a celebrity or widely known person , though there are a number of disadvantages as well .
First of all , many local and world known celebrities claim of having no private life .
Being famous means that probably most of your life journalists , your neighbours and ordinary people will be interested in your life .
Most of the time , it is impossible to avoid this kind of attention .
People are curious and they admire their favourite stars ' lives by reading magazines , watching TV or surfing the Internet .
Moreover , such yellow press columns with the title ' celebrities ' hit the selling records , giving a huge benefits for the publishing companies .
Millions of people are able to buy magazines with celebrities on the covers , although some photos give the readers some ' additional ' , and not the most pleasant details .
People are interested almost in everything : the articles about the break - ups , drug abused young celebrities , questionable relationships , or even the special ones with naked celebrity photos .
This is more than sharing some of your private life details , most of the press people look for scandals and their aim is to uncover the most intimate secrets .
Secondly , being successful and famous also requires the person to be good at his or her job .
The ' star ' is followed not only by the public eye , he or she is also evaluated by producers and future employing companies .
There is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , better and desirable jobs , including supreme salaries .
The majority of celebrities have their personal managers , who take care about their image .
So even if you are rich and famous , it not always means that you would be able to live and act as you would like to .
Fame has another side , there are strict requirements for actors , singers , etc . , which appear as they sign contracts with the companies , which provide their jobs .
Attending some events , or parties may be a necessity and depend not always from the wishes of a celebrity .
Also , it is said the fame spoils people and they struggle with their personal problems , only it is even more difficult to help them , than to any ordinary people .
Sometimes there are cases , when the lack of private life leads to more serious issues .
We all know that some well known people become engaged with illegal activities , start using drugs or alcohol , as well they join some mysterious religious groups .
Sometimes they even become suicidal just because they can not live under the constant pressure .
Even if being in the public eye is not always very pleasant , there is a number of advantages why it is worth sacrifing a little of your private live .
Going deep into public entertainment world , which is definitely rewarding gives you a lot of benefits .
Most of celebrities do not work all their lives , although the money they gain during their careers ( sometimes it is a very short period of success ) allow them to live without any worries .
Giving away some personal life details , while you are famous , may bring you to fortune .
For example , many celebrities sell their baby born photos to magazines , as they offer enormous sums of money , in order to get a tiny glimpse into their family life .
Moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence other people , especially young generations .
By setting a good example celebrities may become idols and inspire other people to live and help others , who are in need .
By donating money for charities , as well as being involved with the volunteering projects is one of the things , you can do when you are wealthy and famous .
To summarise , fame comes with many disadvantages , as well as it has a number of advantages .
Celebrities have different experiences .
Their lives seem to be glamorous and they look gorgeous , though you will never know what is under the ' beautiful and sparkling cover '
Shopping Online
Currently , with the internet having penetrated in our lives , shopping online enjoys a great popularity among us , especially for the young people .
Although some deny shopping online for the virtual of the internet , I , unhesitatingly , am hooked on it .
First of all , we enjoy more convenient and time - saving by shopping online .
For example , time and space could not be taken into account if we shop online .
Since we want to purchase something , we can shop online .
As is well - known , there is no shutdown at online stores .
In addition , walking for a long time and distance could be avoided if we shop online .
Because once we place an order , the merchant will dispatch the goods immediately .
Meanwhile , it 's more easily to buy the quality and inexpensive goods through the internet .
Thanks to displays of the feedback of the customs and the merchants ' reputation on the webpage for us , we can value the goods directly and pick out the goods , to some extent , from the vast range of goods that we eager for online .
Finally , shopping online plays an essential role in our lives for its convenience and flexibility .
In other words , Shopping online does really perfect our lives .
I believe that it will be more wholesome and guaranteed with the optimizing of the network market .
Dear USA Summer Camp ,
I want to have this job because I like children , being outside , also I am a person who works a lot if it is nesessary at night .
I am very good organised activities suitable for children , also last year I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children , also taught me how to work with children .
Last year I went to cooking lessons , I learnt how to prepare food suitable for children , also I know how to prepare desserts for adults and for children .
I 'm a nice person , funny and sociable with children .
At the moment , public transport are used but many people are starting to travel much more using their own cars instead of travelling with public transport which ; in my opinion , are better to be used .
One reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , railways , etc . we can fit more people than in a car or in a motorbike , so we pollute less because we use all the same vehicle instead of using each person one car or one motorbike which will pollute much more ; as always things have a price but there is a question that must be asked , is it worth paying to save our ecosystem or even our lives ?
I think so and besides it is much cheap than buying a car and will be putting petrol per month or less ; another reason I prefer to use public transport is because I have to adapt to a schedule , so I would not be late at the place I want to go , besides that bus stops are some codes that are used to see how lack to come the next bus .
To conclude , public transport is much better than using a car or a motorbike , but people ca n't see it .
Terrorism is the use to fear and acts of violence in order to intimidate societies or governments .
Many different types of social or political organizations might use terrorism to try to achieve their goals .
It is difficult to define terrorism .
Terrorism has no official criminal law definition at the international level .
Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts which are intended to create fear ( terror ) ; are done for a religious , political , or ideological goal ; and which target civilians .
Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war .
The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism , though these same actions may be called terrorism when done by a politically motivated group .
Best friends are meant to be forever .
In that sense , family will be there with us forever .
But , what if they are not that much close to you ?
what if they keeps you pampered always ?
Of course you will feel irritated especially at teenage .
Family protects us , gives care but , it'll be irritating if they do the same when you grow up .
They should give some space for yourself .
When you are a child , you love to be with your parents;love hanging with them around.once you come across your childhood change the same track to friends , consider them as your everything.keeping in mind that only family will be there with you in the worse .
I think they changed since there are more and more fat kids by the day .
Portugal is one of European countries with more fat kids , with a little higher amount of fat kids than Spain and Ireland .
Eastern European countries are the ones with less fat kids , maybe an influence of former communist rule ?
When you do n't have anything to eat , you do n't get fat and , consequently , you do n't get filled with diseases that are common in fat people , like diabetes .
That 's the only , although unintended , upside of communism over capitalism .
Although it would be amusing for me to continue to slag off communism , let 's not go there .
The topic is about eating habits , a thing that is always eradicated , alongside health and prosperity , when communists gain power over countries .
Bang !
Nowadays in my country people eat a lot of the same unhealthy food that other people eat in the rest of the Western countries .
We used to eat a lot of codfsh , the stereotypical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , and that 's part of the reason we have so many fat kids .
When I was a kid , fifteen years ago , the kids used to be slim .
When I entered the first grade , there was n't a single fat kid in the class .
Today , 32% of kids are fat .
In the time period of just twenty years we became one of the countries in Europe with more fat kids .
So yes , eating habits have changed dramatically in my country , but we may get back our good old slim silhouettes after our - probably - new government , a coalition of socialists and communists , takes office .
Food , everybody loves it , some people hate it also - those who ca n't control themselves and suffer the consequences to their health of overeating .
Lack of self - control is a very sad thing .
Fortunately , I do n't have that problem .
I 'm lacking inspiration to write , but I will try , because I have to .
Eating habits in my country .
I already talked about the fat kids who eat shit that makes them fat .
Shitty food is trendy in my country , like I said , but that 's true for every European country , like I also said .
But I guess is better than eating roots and animal corpses , like our hominid ancestors ate millions of years ago .
Hunter - gatheres thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n't have to eat rotting flesh because they hunt animals - like the first half of their name suggests ... I know I really look like an idiot by writing this kind of things , but that only proves that I was telling the truth when I said I 'm lacking inspiration .
I 've been reading Milton 's Paradise Lost , first because I wanted to read it for its literary significance , second because I want to improve my English , and reading in it is a good way achieve that goal .
I 'm only in the First Book .
It 's na excellent work , of course .
I thought I would have trouble comprehending Milton 's English , because , you know , its not English you hear from the average and comtemporaneous English speaker , but it turns out it 's a much easier read than I thought .
I find Shakespeare harder , although , with a bit of a fight , I manage to get it too , but not always , at least for now .
Dear 230 year - old me , I am only 15 now I haven't live enough .
I am just a kid , I am not complete yet , I have a lot to discover and to shape in my life .
I have no idea how I am going to get there I am now in my bed studying for my tests of tomorrow but I guess in 215 years from now it wo n't matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long , are n't you bored of living ?
Do you ever wish you were dead ?
I bet you have the God complex , you must feel powerful ...
But do you ?
Or perhaps you feel weak , vulnerable , dead inside , lost ... You have lived for so long more than anyone should .
Of course living like this must have consequences , how it is like in your head ?
How do you look ?
What do you think of yourself ?
Are you happy about what you have become ?
Of what you have done ?
What is the price of being you ?
Did you really give up everything to have what you have ?
Do you ever regret it ?
Do you feel lonely ?
What are you doing with your cold heart ?
Is there anything capable of unfrozing it ?
I dreamt of you , you know ?
We were in a forest , the sun was at the top of the sky , the birds were singing , I could heard the sound of the water falling , it was a heavenly place , it was beautiful , then you were there , behind a tree , you did n't say a word , we just got closer , you were looking into my eyes so was I , and then I put my right hand on your cheek , and in that moment I felt you , your skin , your soul , your existence .
And it last for a few moment , it was magical .
I guess we are going to meet only in one place , in Heaven , we are not suppose to know each other on Earth .
Not in our miserable mortal lives , it does not matter anyway .
I felt you in that dream and i would not change it to a thing .
I felt close to you .
And somehow , without even meeting you I fell in love with your existence .
And it kills me tongiht that I will always have love in my heart for you , forever .
I will weep for you my love , day and night , even the time when my eyes wo n't let my tears slip away , my heart will always do it .
Reckless , pretty and wild
I hated the teacher was Clara .
She taught history in 2º E.S.O. She has a short brown curly hair .
She always had a ponytail .
Clara was serious and bossy .
She generally was shouting everyone when she taught a lesson .
Clara was worse than Pilar , my teacher of English .
Pilar was kind and fantastic with children .
School " Valle del Ambroz " is a small place .
It 's has a small building located in the centre of village .
Classes are smalls and pavilion too .
The queality of teachers was good although teachers has explained very poorly because students were not tell very well .
I sometimes hated them because the did n't see effort that we did for approve exams because we were so psyched for it .
The other reason why hated was difficult what they put exams and they were also demanding .
However I have a great memory all my teachers because I help me pull it off .
Istil dreaming that there will be achance for me to make a trip around world , there is many ways to travel from a place to another , but i prefer doing that on aboat or a train .... because on boat or train ican fill the windos on my face or my hand , ican hear the sound of birds above me , on the plan you can see only the blow sky and nothing more ... it is a strang idea for me to be betwen the earth and the sky so i prefer traveling in boat or a train
Not only public transport has future , but it also deserves a bright one .
Despite the fact that travelling by car may be more comfortable , we all should be absolutely conscious that public transport ought to occupy a prime spot in our futre movility .
Otherwise , the future of the Earth might be put in danger .
Indeed , if we , as a civilised society , were aware of the problem of the greenhouse gases that are then and again expelled to the atmosphere , we would use the public transport much more often .
In this way , the air pollution would be reduced as a consequence of the use of buses , trains or the underground , all of them public means of transport that can avoid the massive presence of particular cars in our streets and roads .
Apart from cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , the safety of our roads would improve , as there would be fewer cars circulating throughout the country .
Both effects would combine to offer a healthier environment , in which our children could grow up safely .
On top of that , there is no excuse to use public transporte , as it has been remarkably improved over the last few years .
Nowadays it is almost possible to access any place at any time by public transport , erasing as a result , one of the main problems that public transport used to have for its potential users .
So if we are determined to preserve our beloved planet and make it a better place to live in , a definite good start would be to leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
The last film I saw was not new , in fact is " The Others".It is the best horror and suspense film that I have ever seen in my life life .
It is set in a small Englan island and it is situated in 1946 when the second war finished .
A crazy woman who is waiting for her husband .
She has the total obligation to protect her children because they are allergic to the light .
Recently in the mansion three new servants appear , Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
Strange things happen in the mansion .
At first the little girl ( son of Grace ) , Anne hear and see this strange things , but his mother and Nicholas ( brother)don't believe him .
Anne all the time said to his mother the strange things that she sees , and Nicholas start too .
The time pass and all in the house start to feel these strange things .
At this moment Charles ( the husband and father ) returns to the house but one day disappear other time .
One day all the curtains in the house dissapeard and this was serious because children were sick and they ca n't receive sunlight .
I would recommend this film to anyone , because the story seems to be real .
The movie has excellent sound effects and transmit epic sensations .
As we discussed before the project was launched , that two - domain structure causes some problem and inconvenience both in management / maintenance and in collecting analytic ( google , etc . )
Thus , using single - domain structure seems better , if it is possible to develop the site in such a way ( in combination of wordpress cms and custom code ) .
Now it 's time to draw the line at all the consideration and take the final decision ( with SCHEME included ) .
To ensure the relationship between members of the same species , movements of the procession are specific to each and the female selects the one that best takes .
Both mates performed movements to show a submission behavior and reach a copulation .
Before I start this pretty obvious presentation , I would like to tell you my own opinion : the well organized , good scheduling , and wide routed transport - this is one and possible variant to move in the city .
So , pluses of personal car : you are sure of the strangers and you are master of your route .
Avoid time wasting for several stops and can reach your goal ( working place , shop or even suburb ski club ) much easier and faster .
And the above arguments are versus to their own car - this is expensive , not ecological , and have to take care about your car ( parking , repair , insurance , cleaning ) and have to find a lot of money to get car .
Thus , the flexibility or the price this is the main question .
As soon the problem of the price for own car possession would be solved , the sooner the question of public transport necessity would be raised again .
Many people believe that public transport 's future would not exist due to an incredible increase new means of transport 's sales -sideways , electric cars or bicycles .
For this reason , people wonder if normal means of transport could desappear by this new transport tendency .
In my opinion I am completely sure that public transport is the best option to move in the city for several reasons .
First of all , and taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , like the bus or underground , is the cheapest way to travelling or even moving in your own city .
Overall , if you add not only the petrol price , also the maintenance , services , insurance and pay a few but expensive taxes .
In addition , Everybody knows that there are more people in a bus than in a car , so consequently , pollution produced is less .
By contrast , it is true that many places have not a good communication and could takes you quite a long time to get there .
But imagine if everyone would have a car , nobody could arrive on time to their work .
On balance , public transport is the best option to move in the city .
But maybe , if communication between villages and bus time - tables improving , public transport could be even better .
Since we had a lot of success with this invention I started to have some fantasies of other high - tech portable inventions I could create .
I started imagining some type of synthetic textile slash fiber that when water touches the surface , it does n't get wet .
This could be really useful for the military because some times they have to work under the rain and their hands and body get wet and it 's uncomfortable .
To do this I had to alter the gravity of the water when it touches the surface so instead of the material absorbing the water , it could have a reflection of it .
At first , when I applied the chemical into the material it became very rigid , thereby , it was uncomfortable to use and it had very little mobility .
I used a fraction less of that chemical tu put it in the clothes to see the results of this minor change of volume on the secret substance I was using to make water have a reflection of a cloth for military and other various purposes like using it in a rainy day and replacing the umbrellas , could make a diferance .
If this invention was able to work I could forthcome a lot of success and money to me , I suspended the cloth again to put the substance on it to see if this time this could work well , I could forsee that if my partners found out about my invention 2 things could happen : they would be proud of me to start creating and developing some new innovative ideas that could make big progress for humanity , or , they could get really mad at me because I did n't tell them about my project , and because we are on a on going project that is very successful they could be very disapointed at me for trying to do another creation while we are still growing this invention that we created about 6 months ago with a lot of hard work .

There 's no future for public transport , because to travel by car is so much more convenient .
when you travel by car you can have more privacy and you can go anywhere , anytime .
It 's more expensive but have a lot of advantages .
The public transport is good for the city but personality is terrible , you need wait and do n't have many directions to achieve your address .
Do n't have much comfort and sometimes you have to go without seat .
Many times , travel by bus are delay and arrive crowd then waste time in all stop bus .
The people are different , and they are always different , no matter how much time pastes , the people are different and they like that .
Maybe the poor people have the possibility to buy a car as well , if cost a lot of money for them , they will buy .
It 's a question of freedom and is a conqueror of the humanity .
Does no matter the improves made for the public transport , traveling the car was and will be the best choice for one future with more choices and no so rigid and compact , but flexible fast and convenient .
My favourite sport is yoga . A fantastic sport .
I like yoga because It is a relaxing sport , when we can work our mind and our body .
Yoga helps to have a greather flexibility and working your concentration .
Yoga help us to live relaxed to and accept life with her is .
It allows you to works the organism by stretching techniques .
Yoga has many benefits both emotional , spiritual and moral that we should learn to take better able to deal with the situations facing us on a daily basis .
The advice I would give someone starting this sport is relax and enjoy the maximum what yoga has to offer you .
According to Lunde , 85% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .
Yes , statistics from SC do support this thesis .
These tragedies illustrate the power of frustration on the human body .
People who murder others probably did n't go into the situation wanting to murder the other .
The person 's frustration led to anger and aggression that just got out of control .
Even small things such as getting in the way of someone 's goal can lead to the frustration which leads to aggressive act of murder .
These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence .
Through exposure , perhaps we have been desensitized to violence .
The media also plays a part in this flippancy .
When a character is shot , he often appears in the next scene .
Kids , in particular , are n't forming realistic schemas regarding violence .
The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes leading to more rapes .
We as potential parents must instill in our children - the future presidents , doctors , teachers , and even murders - a true picture of aggression and the need to control it .
Racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago .
It is actually appearing to decline .
This is evidenced in , for example , cartoons and t.v . shows - racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped .
Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed - perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitably and cognitive dissonance .
Perhaps through the media and other sources some misconceptions are being cleared up and more realistic information is being provided to the public .
I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities of ideas and opinions with that person 's or genuinely consider presenting his opinions and then converting to the others ' opinions .
He should also appear competent , but not perfect ( the pratfall effect ) .
He could at first pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain - loss theory ) .
The client should appear as attractive as he can w / o using his attractiveness to manipulate her .
The client can hope ( particularly if he is of avg or lower attractiveness ) that she has a moderately low self - esteem and will thus be less selective in her choices for dates or friends .
The client should also disclose personal info .
to the client to induce her to like him .
This advice can be backed up w/ research .
It would be better for the client to ask a favor of the person - b / c from this cognitive dissonance , the other would view the client as being generally more favorable .
In discussing sensitivity , the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one 's own feelings , thoughts , and the effects of his own behaviour on others .
Only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others ' feelings .
Sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication .
Confrontation can make one more sensitive to his own behavior and how others interpret it .
One should be sensitive to the others ' interpretation of his behavior so that he will know better how to act .
Micheal arrived home at 5:45 pm .
He went straight into his room with a furious face .
He sat down on his bed , screaming .
After that , he began to smash his things .
His mother heard the noise and decided to see what was going on .
She took the stairs , and went into Micheal 's room .
She saw things lying everywhere .
She asked him why he did it .
Micheal , instead of answering , shouted at her .
He and his mother had a clash on something .
A while later , she left the room , leaving the door open .
At that moment , Micheal began to calm down .
He thought about what he had done and let out a sigh .
Micheal closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Genetic manipulation is an area which has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientic field with a number of advantages and disadvantages .
One of the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms genetic makeup towards man 's needs .
The possibilities are endless , a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry , hot conditions of many third world countries , relieving them of their worries of starvation .
Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people 's resistance to them .
Of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists .
Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents and gardeners cross breed plants to suit their individual needs .
However , their is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
The advantages seem very favourable and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for these .
But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ?
There are many possibilities for the misuse of this process .
One is a question of ethics and morals .
Is it right to try and change motive ?
Is it the right of one man to play God ?
It is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering .
A new plant which has an increased growthrate may seem like an answer to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem , draining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow ?
In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area such as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal , it my not be possible to find a solution .
Another problem would be the process of testing .
We are already near the stage where it is possible to test people 's genetic make up to find the possibility of their developing certain illness .
Soon it may be possible for firms to only employ people with a certain expected lifespan or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test .
Although the threat of the Cold War has diminished , the technology made available from studies into genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands - particularly in the area of germ warfare .
Although the scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life which their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they would be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology .
I 'm so sorry too late sending e - mail
It nice to hear from you and read .
The month of March first days is terrible , because I had cold then toothache for about 2 weeks .
Now I had healed over .
We are fine .
I 'm doing my job and studying master 's lesson .
My masters first semester , I have studying which lessons Thin film fabrications and applications , Theoritical physics , and Diffraction methods . Theoritical physics little bit boring .
And studying raman spectroscopy .
I am glad to the weather will be warming the temperature -4 to + 2 degrees Celsius .
The problem that not enough much time to learn English .
it 's bad .
i 'm confused but I know only one thing that must be study English .
It had been long discussed that people always learn big lesson from mistake .
Some people think there is no room for mistake in daily life , work even in their family .
However , I certainly consider Mistake is truly a necessary step in our learning experience .
I am going to show a real story about Michael to testify my viewpoint .
Michael was a six years old child who lives in the lovely countryside with his parent and his newborn little brother , Tom .
In this small countryside , Michael received whole his parents ' love , attention and passion .
Nonetheless , things went different until little Tom born , Michael lose all care suddenly .
He felt deeply despair and tried all his effort to get back concern that belong to himself .
In a zoo of the south of France , millions of species live there .
This place is visiting daily by many children and adults for the people that live in that country , and also in another country .
One day , some friends of the city that this zoo is , decides to stroll along the river , to have a picnic , to play football and spend a good time together .
They were on holidays .
Suddenly , while they were playing fotball and eating a sandwich each one of them , Max saw a little lion that wants to attack and get all of your food , although it is tender to see this situation , Bob was a little scared .
Max was very fond with the animal , because he thought it was very small and very playful , otherwise , he and his three other friends would never had approached the animal .
It was dusk , in the warm summer of the southern France , while they saw two men of security that walks towards them of the great zoo of this city , we look at each other and we said that the animal had been escaped from the zoo .
Finally , the starry sky and full night , and each one in your house .
He was very exhausted and said:"What an amazing day ! "
Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
I 'm so glad to hear you are coming !
You have no idea how happy I am .
In connection with your question , I 'll try to tell you how you can reach my house .
There are three possibilities .
Firstly , you can take a taxi , but I have to warn you about the taxi drivers .
They 're sly boots and they could ask you to pay more than it really cost .
Secondly , you can take the bus .
Unfortunately our buses are n't comfortable .
And the last alternative , and I recommend this one to you , is my car !
I 'll wait to collect you at the airport and it wo n't cost you anything .
Since you ask about the best places to visit , I 'd suggest visiting a few places such as Oxford , London and Piccadilly .
These places are really pulchritudinous !
I 'm sorry I wo n't be able to accompany you on your excursions , as I have not much free time and need to complete my assignments .
You 're lucky because museums and galleries are not too far from my house .
You can go to one of the most famous museums in the UK , such as the British Museum .
I recommend seeing the galleries in the Royal Academic of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery .
I 'm certain you will not be disappointed !
I had never felt so nervous before in my life because it was the first time for me being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
How could I possibly know that some months after that day I would be performing for the president of our country for even more people ?
As I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , there were several things running through my head .
I thought of losing my consciousness , getting a heart attack or even worse : being shouted a bad singer by somebody from the audience .
At this point my knees started wobbling and I felt as if I was going on pudding .
Whenever I make a flashback to these seconds , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed to get on this stage but somehow I finally found myself standing there and in slow motion grabbing for the microphone with my hands shaking like an earthquake had just evoked .
The moment had come .
I inhaled and could almost feel the air widening my lungs .
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down and to bring all my concentration to the first note which ... did n't come .
Well , it did but not noticeable for anybody .
So I tried again and suddenly my attitude changed from the mouse who was nervous like hell to the woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .
The melody started to flow and I was happily filling the hall with the music .
Like is it sayed in the top " There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
" , yes I agree with that cuz ' now the people are geting tired to waith the bus or any public transport vehicles , now the personal car is the power , if you want to go ...
i do n't know ..... in a place like your holyday house , maybe a bus can not arrive there and you a need a personal car .
If you want to move stuff from a place to diferent place you ca n't do that with a bus , you need a personal car , so a personal care is better then a public tarnsport vehicle .
The principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with the information about the interests of young people in my country .
I am going to write about their interests in music , in the television programmes and in the clothes they are used to wearing , concluding with my personal statement .
Firstly , by conducting a survey among young people of my area , it emerged that music is essential for them .
In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and by the music videos as well .
For the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer is also their idol .
Secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programmes such as films and series .
Series became so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching series on their technology items , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .
Moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed by TV series and they lose their social life as well .
Lastly but not leastly , youngsters are interested in fashion .
In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that they are very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are .
In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should regard all of these young people 's interests if the orginisers want it to be a success .
In the picture I can see a boy walking two dogs on the seaside .
I think he 's about 12 years old .
He is wearing a black ' n white jacket and black shorts .
He is shoeless .
One dog has got brown fur , it 's breed is dachshund .
The second dog is white and it 's breed is Maltese .
The boy is looking at the dogs at leashing them .
It seems to he is happy .
There are some rocks in the sea and on the beach , there is also a bough laying on the sand .
The weather does n't look very badly , but it ' s cloudy and I think it 's not so hot there .

Finally , I am looking forward to see you in my country soon .
Sincerely ,
Ngoc Duong
A topic that I like so much is about electricity .
In today 's world everybody uses the electrical energy for almost all .
It is present in your personal computer , lamps and anything which you need to plug it in .
But almost no one knows is that the electricity travels a long way to arrive in your houses .
The journey starts in the plant of energy , wherein the electricity is generate by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy and other methods .
Then , the electrical energy travels even the substation .
After this , the electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive in your house without troubles and it occurs in a place called substation .
Therefore , we need to thought very well before to waste energy .
Because it is an expensive cost for you and mainly for the environment .
ESSAY
It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games .
Some people believe that it 's waste of time and a bad habit too , while some others think that it 's a good way to spend your free time .
To my mind there pros and cons .
First of all , computer games can help you to escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .
Apart from that , quite convenient mainly because you stay at home and have entertainment .
Also video games are interesting than traditional toys so they capture teenager 's interest .
Last but not least , some of them are educational and give you the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge .
On the other hand , there are many drawbacks .
To begin when you spend a lot of hours in the computer screen you become addicted to them .
As a result , you do n't get together with your friends and you do n't communicate face to face .
In addiction , a lot of video games are full of violence and teens are tend to imitate them so they have violent and aggressive behavior .
Also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes .
In conclusion , computer games is a nice way to spend your free time but always in moderation .
I feel the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives .
This , realistically , has been quite a new invention , and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly .
Not to mention how it will change people 's life styles in the future .
These changes resulting from the invention of the computer , have been , I feel both bad and good .
Technologically , computers have improved people 's lives drastically .
No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually , or even with a simple typewriter .
Personal computers are becoming quite common , and therefore less expensive and easier to own .
Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before .
Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open .
We now have ATM , automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do .
It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers !
We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently .
Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results .
While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they also have " impersonalized " the world .
Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not " fast enough " .
Interraction with humans in some places is extinct .
Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interraction between people .
In addition , it is also very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine .
It is a common fact machines do fail !
Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on - coming obstical is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?
People soon stop thinking , and allow machines to do the work for them .
I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires .
Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions , and therefore are incapable , in some instances to function .
With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future .
Some of these changes will save people 's lives , such as advances in medical technology , safety , etc .
But I fear that our world will become a very impersonal place .
I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain " slow " .

I would like to recommend Mzolis restaurant .
It is a place located in the heart of Warsaw .
A lot of foreigners go there to try delicious , traditional South African grilled food .
It is rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style what guarantees a really nice ambiance .
When it comes to food you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic one .
About the service , I can all it unusual as you choose your meat and the staff will prepare your dish , then you go to the kitchen to get your dish and eat it with your hands .
I have been there once and I really like that place , you feel at home and the food is delicious .
The price is also the cheapest I could find in this country .
The main reason why I like that place is because I could see many different people from different parts of the world .
I was there several times but I still would like to go there again with my classmates .
the best film
i am a fan club film , that call high school musical fans .
High school musical is the best film i could see in the wold .
When you see the thriller you can stop looking for and immediately you want to see the film .
It 's a move that all people could see .
i think i find it exciting because i love all film like them .
this great move is about a group of people that go to the secondary school , this school its not like all school , its different because you a lot of activity 's like basketball , theater , etc .
i think that people could like to see it because when you saw , you can stop it and you have a lot of music , song and people dancing .
in my opinion it s the best film i saw in my life and if you have the oportunited to see , do it .
The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport .
There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place .
The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport .
In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox 's getting at his chickens .
If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts .
When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs .
Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed .
Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair .
Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience .
If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel , it is just the way of life .
Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback .
The fox is then chased until it is caught .
Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned .
Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .
I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it .
If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport .
The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain .
Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits .
If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else .
A few people enjoy the sport and allows them to socalise .
I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as it is very cruel .
Anouther reason why it should not be banned is because foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them .
If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned and a more reasonable death should be considered .
REPORT
This report will deal with whether cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities or not .
The amount of cars have been increased in countries in the last decade .
Too many cars running around the people can be a serious problem to deal with .
But what should we do to make it up ?
There are some pros and cons .
Pros
First , there would be less noise in streets .
In particular in Spain where city centres are usually quite narrow .
Second , there would be less air pollution .
It is proved that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to the health .
Third , cities would be friendlier to live .
Places where people could enjoy walking around .
Cons
First , local sellers ' work could be damaged in that area because they could need to upload and download goods for the shops .
Second , people who lives in that part of the city could be affected in a negative way because they could need to pass through it with some cars so as to get home .
In my opinion it would be a good idea to do it but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right .
There is an opinion that computers will be used instead of books in the future .
I believe that it is true , because computers are more convenient and easier to use .
Tablets are light and you can give only it without caring many heavy books .
and it is common knowledge that gadgets make our life easier .
But some people have other opinion about it .
Firstly , study at school became simple , Students can find a lot of different information about something interesting .
I do n't know where to start .
I 'm only going to bare my heart to my computer .
Because I feel lonely myself .
And I do n't know what I need exactly , and I do n't know what I should do definitely .
But I understand for sure I need some changes in my life .
I wish some really pleasant and enjoyable evens burst into my life .
It must happen I 'm sure .
The question is how long do I have to have being waiting yet .
My patience is already ending .
I refuse to understand and accept the fact that I ca n't afford myself luxurious life .
Yes , I was always dreaming about wealth .
I am not a greedy avaricous person .
I only want my wishes are fulfilled .
I have not so many desires in my mind .
I only wish my most favourite and loved ones are healthy and wealthy and happy .
I wish I with my daughters and my husband are travelling a lot , we love each other and we have enough money for everything we want .
The Single European Act , signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July , 1987 aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992 .
This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal , technical and physical barriers .
This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country , an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications .
There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system .
Despite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers , whereas Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .
In accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain , Parliament is the supreme law - making body in the United Kingdom .
Consequently the emergence of another source of law , deemed to be supra - national is inevitably a problem .
One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties .
However these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals , so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom , by an Act of Parliament .
This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law , so that to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is retained .
Yet , this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law .
Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation , movement , work and many other realms , there are also many disadvantages in store , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent .
Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis , for example in Criminal Law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .
Not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law , but also any later statutes passed by the British Parliament will either be construed in the light of Community provisions or declared invalid .
To conclude , it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways , although only within the sphere of Community Law prevailing over national law .
In other senses the sovereignty of Britain will be safeguarded for Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
The turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe .
Each decade in itself has introduced a new " fad " or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as " typical " of the era .
The " Roaring 20 's " for example was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile .
A very capricious decade , it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the " Great Depression " of the 30 's .
How could we ever forget the " Fabulous Fifties " or the hippie decade of the 60 's and 70 's ?
For change is inevitable , and as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the decade , there is one aspect of the 20th Century that will remain with me forever .
So as we embark on the year 2000 , I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century , " The Century of Democracy . "
Perhaps , it is because today is November 4th , the day after the U.S. elections .
Perhaps , it is because the former superpower of the Soviet Union is now making its transition into a democracy .
Perhaps , it is because I am thousands of miles from my home , but I 'm feeling very patriotic these days .
No , I 'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen from the United States .
Rather , I 'm feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations .
In the past 2 years alone , we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe .
Not too long ago , I remember the democratic demonstrations that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic superpower .
At the World Expo in Sevilla , not a month ago , I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall- the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War .
That wall is gone forever and I feel lucky to be among the many who could follow its happening .
The Soviet Union , as well is going through its own transition to democracy .
The many unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their nation of its communist government .
The superpower among superpowers that to me had long been the example of marxism is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world .
With the end of the Cold War , there has been more peaceful relations throughout the world .
The idea of a nuclear war is practically non - existent today .
Arms sales have gone down so that nations may spend this money in more worthwhile areas .
In conclusion , as the turn of the century slowly approaches , I look back with a feeling of accomplishment as well as anticipation as to what lies ahead .
As a world of many scattered nations , conflict is inevitable .
However , if we all have one bond- democracy- then maybe together , we can learn to understand one another , and work towards a happier world for all .
It is a well - known fact that everybody needs holidays .
To begin with this topic we need to ask ourselves about several matters to have in mind .
Firstly we must be aware of our economic situation , the season where we are , the people who come with us , the transport , the accommodation , the place .. and more matters that we should note when we decide to go on holidays .
Secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or around our home ? .
This could be the first question that we wonder before going on holidays .
Nowadays , due to the globlalization and the increased number of flights around the world , we can find out a wide range of webpages where the flight companies offer their services with an incredible low prices .
Because of this low prices , many people decide to go abroad instead of travelling near their home .
Of course , in order to prepare a good trip you also must consider the accommodation , the food , etc and depending on the place you choose , you will spend more money or less .
Another point to consider should be the environment , if you go abroad , you can visit the knownest typical monuments and historical natural places around the world and if you stay in your country , despite is sure you can see a lot of places , the things to see are limited .
In clonclusion , I think one person must consider several points when you plan a holiday trip and it depends on the person 's knowledge about where to go and how , what to determine if one trip could be cheaper or expensive .

That is why I consider that my experience and qualifications fits very well with this position 's requirements .
Moreover I would especially like point out that I have always been interested in working with people , especially taking care of little children and help them to be happy .
For all these reasons , I am consider I am a very suitable candidate for this position and I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and talk with you further about this vacancy .
My contacting data is in the attached cv , at your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours Sincerely .
The European Community is the grouping of 12 sovereign European States whose intention is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
It 's intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services , capital and the workforce .
The competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance .
European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market .
The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced , hopefully to the highest common denominator .
The European does not serve only as a useful trade association , however , for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together .
Co - operation between the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug - smuggling and terrorism .
The common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources .
However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur .
The single European Act was designed to speed - up the decision making of certain institutions .
The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co - operation and joint action in the areas of foreign , social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members .
The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law , which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty .
More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe .
The question is how much sovereignty is Britain prepared to lose and do the benefits of belonginging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages .
A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt and in the next few years this will increase .
As far as the immediate future is concerned a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress .
In most of the earlier studies the effect of either ocean acidification or warming has been investigated at a time .
However in nature these stressors affect the organism combinedly and the effect could be more than the effect of a single stressor .
I remember the old people how they did with their children .
They were all poor , they do n't have enough money to pay their children 's education .
All the children should have to help their parents .
Some of them have been adopted to other parents .
The children wanted to learn education but they do n't have enough money to pay .
Some of the children were working in the sugar cane field or they work in a shop to receive money to feed themselves and have many good people who was in good manner .
Nowadays many people have change their lifestyle .
And their life have become bird in the sky .
Some of them have already achieve their life .
They have plenty of money and their children have all that they want and some children are very bad manner .
They do n't respect their parents and they did not wonder what they did .
Some of them have already gave birth a child at the age of sixteen or marry .
The world has already change now .
They have good doctor who are qualified and great skill .
Many people developed their own country .
For example they want to attract more and more tourists in their country .
Some of the children who at the age are eighteen are already left their home to live along with their girlfriend .
They did not remember what their parents have did for them .
The people have changed the style of their life ..
Some of boys like to give a new hairstyle .
Just like girls , they like to put many accessory with them like makeup .
They want to give a new fashion to make a number for themselves .
People became more skill and also more bad manner .
The next 50 years people can create many electronic things like cars and machines like television .
The television has brought many advantages which would never be envisaged by our great grandparents .
People will develop more model television .
Year by year the world will change and become more develop .
Long ago the early cars had wooden bodies which made them extremely vulnerable in the event of a crash .
About 30 years the cars has switched to all steel bodies .
Today cars are stronger , lighter and safer than earlier designs .
It means that today people create more new features .
The television is an interesting source of information , people see every day , you have one comedy program until a quantic physics , the television is a study object if you propose that , is only a more tool in your investigation .
If you arrive in the morning , you have a tv news , in the news have a good rating , all the people need to have the information about the world day after day .
If you enter on the afternoon , you have a kids or young people , but the really have an interest in this proposal is , the all people want to see the soap operas on this hours and want to see the comedies or an interesting documentaries about whatever we want .
Hi Ana ,
Yes , I am in progress with learning English right now .
By coincidence I work in IT sphere now , therefore I need this language in my daily communication with customers .
Please feel free to contact me in case of any questions .
Thanks ,
Alex
I do n't agree .
I think the future is the public transport .
Also , I think this applies many things .
Now we live in the shared world , where all is shared : work , development , ideas , many things .
This is a new philosophy .
The base of this philosophy is " to share " .
this idea brings great benefits for all .
Is the same case for the transport .
If we would share transport ( public transport ) could be lower cars therefore would have less contamination and less traffic .
Everybody saves money and The familiar economy is better .
The cities become more agile and is easier to get to the places .
This model have many advantages .
To solve the problem of traditional model . Because then the traffic is worst and the time in both kinds of transport can grow and be horrible . it 's more comfortable and quicker to move in personal transport but if only exist one mode of transport these will be more efficient and more comfortable for all of us .
I think the whole world would benefit : Environment , people , family , work .. so on
I agree with this statement . I think future will be like everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .
Nowadays , every person want to live convenient for yourself .
So they just buy new car for yourself 's using .
But some people ca n't buy it .
Because , they haven't got enough money and they have material problem .
So they accounts to use public transport .
There is untouchable to poor people .
In my opinion , using public transport will be not so popular than travelling bycar .
In my opinion the public transport has a long future because a lot of people live in big city and they do n't use the car for move in the city because the public transport is more comfortable , which they can take the bus and next take the underground and finally arrive in anyplace that they want .
But if they use the car probably the world be late for the place that they go .
I think if the people use a public transport there are less contamination and the sky on the city should be blue instead of grey so anybody should't say that the public transport is n't have future .
Moreover a lot of people use public transport because it is n't have a car .
In conclusion , nowadays people are very conscience about the environment , which it could be produced by cars , and they do n't use the car a lot so I think that is n't the end for the public transport .
Today we see a lot of television . I think that it is not a great result , due to watching more television you can became laziness .
In addition , most of these programs are stupids , good only to spare your time .
The reason is that a lot of people do n't want to receive bad news , but they only love to be entertainment .
Fortunately , not all tv channels have these programs .
There is somebody that try to invent new programs trying to educate people .
One of these is Channel 5.During the day , they transmit some interesting programs about history and nature .
I strongly believe that it 's possible to do both of the programs .
For example , during the days it 's possible to mix sending news , quiz programs , but also documentaries and interviews .
If we have channel programs like these , I am sure that all the Italian citizen could have a good benefit and more knowledge about our beautiful world .
Dear Alison
How are you doing ? I am writing to you just to let you know the eating habits and customs in my country .
In Argentina the most typical food are empanadas , mate and dulce de leche .
I am hundred percent sure that everyone in this country have already try empanadas at least once .
We usually have breakfast as soon as we wake up .
Most people usually drink chocolate milk and eat biscuits at breakfast .
We also have a tea time and we eat similar that in the morning . I know for you it will sound kind of weird!. We have lunch at twelve o'clock and dinner around ten .
What really make a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , most common the barbecue , with the whole family .
It is a custom that I hope I will never lose it!.You should come to visit me and experience it by yourself , I am sure you will love it !
I hope my letter has helped you !
Best wishes
Belu
Lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose their important role .
First of all due to fact that travelling by car is much more convenient .
Actually you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or to reach the shopping mall , but even to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , a plane or a bus .
Actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common being stacked along the road .
But it could be quite the same for travelling by bus and other means of transport .
Secondly cars are becoming cheaper day after day , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy people .
So far public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally correct and fast .
On the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a bad impact on the quality of air and that they are one of the most important causes of pollution .
On the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airlines companies have surely a great impact on the air pollution .
Anyway , it could be possible travelling by car and when you arrive in a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or to walk instead of catching buses , trains , the underground or other public means of transport .
Cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much more healthy , cheaper and faster .
We must even take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed lots of new vehicles .
There are now available new models , for example electric cars , that are environmentally - friendly ; they are not so expansive so everyone can buy one of them .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that travelling by car will be day by day faster , cheaper and even environmentally less dangerous .
I think doing sports are healthy .
When we do sport , we feel better , our body and our mind are good .
My favourite sport is yoga .
I go to the gym three times a week .
I love it , because when the class finishes , I fell well .
I sometimes take for a walk in the forest .
I made the Santiago way 10 years ago .
I like very much .
I walked 760 km .
I started in Roncesvalles and I finished in Santiago de Compostela .
This way is so beautiful .
I met a lot of people the other countries , such as Brazil , Germany , Australia so or on .
Car might be more comfortable but still more risky than train or bus .
I prefer to use my private car because of the long distance between my home and the location of my company .
Michael was just sitting there , wondering what should come next in his life .
Time passed away , while the answers still did not show up to him , that was the moment he decided to make things happen .
He took a bag filled with clothes and snacks , no matter what , this will become the adventure of his life , a new beginning .
He walked outside his home and take the very first cab he saw . "
Nowhere " was written in black bold letters on a sign in the front window of that cab .
He started wondering about the infinite choices he had ahead . "
Just take me to a bar " - he thought to himself , but no , that was to simple . "
Take me to the airport " - repeated in his mind , but no , that is too crazy .
" Just drive , I does n't matter where " - he said to the taxi driver , whispering to his feet " maybe I should not run away " .
He felt the guilt of leaving in the very second he grab the cab door .
It was because of her wife ?
No .
It was because of her daughter ?
No .
It was because of his poor - payed job ?
No .
It was because he did not take the courage before , before it was selfish , before it was incorrect .
But the question rounding his mind was : " Does that really matters ? " .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is true that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
But at the same time , it also consume much more energy than travelling by public transport .
Rather than saying there is no future for public transport .
I think it is more correct to say that there 's no future for individual auto transport .
Due to global warming , many countries including Taiwan , Turkey and Germany had been starting to promote public transport in order to protect our environment .
Their government tries to increase oil price and decrease public transport prices .
Although the government tries to make us using more public transport .
I think there 's still limited impact on our society .
The most efficient way is to promote it by ourselves .
If we all start to use public transport and tell people how good it is to our planet .
I guess more people will start to do it .
SOCIAL NETWORKS
If you want to talk with your friends , to share photos or to post anything you want , you have so many opportunities to do that : the social sites .
Nowadays , people use the Internet to do anything - from taking information to sharing photos , upload videos and other useful things .
So , the social networks are very extended now on the internet .
The most popular social networks are Facebook , Twitter , Yahoo , Flickr , WhatsApp , Tumblr , Ask.fm a.s.o .
Let 's take Facebook as an example .
Facebook is the biggest and the most used social network .
It has more than 1 billion users .
You can use a Facebook account for texting your friends , keeping in touch with them , sharing your own experiences , receiving notifications , uploading photos and videos and of course , seeing what your friends post .
You can also see what 's their opinion and what 's new in politics , business and entertainment .
You can promote you own business , so your products and services can find easier their target .
Facebook has a lot of benefits , but at the same time , it can be very dangerous !
On the internet are so many people who pretend they are someone else .
Now , let me tell you my " Facebook story " .
When I was 11 years old , I had my first Facebook account .
I was so excited about it !
I felt like I have just discovered the technology .
I started to post photos with me , to share videos , to update status and meet new people .
Then , I was thinking that it 's " cooler " to write on Facebook that I live in Netherlands and work at Jack Daniel 's .
I remember that I used to answer to everybody , no matter who they were .
I talked with Romanian , Indian English , Arabian people and other strangers .
I did n't realised I was in danger .
Two years later , when I was 13 years old I started to realise that my old photos , videos and status were completely stupid and I decided to delete them all !
I have also changed my work place and my country and I deleted the unknown people in my " friends list " , but I made a really big mistake : I made my phone number public !
One week later , after making my phone number public , I was called by a lot of strangers and some of them were using the prived number .
I really did n't like it !
Now , I 'm 15 years old and I think I 'm mature enough to use Facebook . I learned a lot from the big mistakes I made on Facebook until now .
I do n't accept friend requests from people I do n't know , I do n't talk to strangers , I do n't give my personal dates ( especially my phone number ) and I think twice before posting something .
I 'm thinking now : What was in my brain when I was talking with strangers ?
Oh my God , I was in a really big danger !
So , I want to give you some advice : Do n't let your kids access Facebook if they have less than 13 years old because they can be very naive and the pshychos , rapists a.s.o are everywhere the Internet .
In my opinion , the social networks can be useful if you know how to use them , as long as you do n't let them control you .
I have a dream .
It seems big or not , I do n't know .
But I really want to make its come true .
My dream originate in Messi . I do n't know how but Messi is my inspiration , maybe
He gave me a dream to go aboard .
Then I will meet him .
Yess .
He also my motive .
Young people tasting : health and fitness
Nowadays , there 's a great deal of information available both on the Internet and on T.V. about how we need to be fit and why it 's so important to keep healthy .
However , are young people aware of these facts ?
I consider most of them do n't pay enough attention to their health and fitness since they spend a lot of time drinking alcohol and smoking .
In spit of going to the gym , they behave badly at the weekend when they go clubbing , for example .
On the other hand , I consider that there are large amount of young people who have fun without drugs and alcohol .
They also go to the gym , play sports and they are on a healthy diet .
In my opinion , you need to be fit to keep healthy .
You should be on a diet and do exercise .
If you do that , your body acts better than you expect .
Our lifestyle regrettably follows going to the gym to get fit but going out to drink alcohol too .
Both are impossible .
Hey , its me Satyajit .
I am a student .

I am a fan of SRK .
I love you Simpy ...

Dear Jen ,
Last week , I went on educational trip together with some students on the same class along with my class adviser .
We visited the National Museum .
It was nice to see the old relics that was preserved for a long time . preserving those relics that are being used today for us to learn what happened in the past .
After the trip , we take our lunch in a nearby food chain .
We enjoyed discussing the trip .
It was the day before yesterday , but Michael did not know this yet .
He just knew that he had to get to work on the novel , he so desperately wanted to finish , but had not managed to complete a single chapter of so far .
He placed himself in front of the oak desk , opened his silver laptop and stared at the white , blank page of the document in front of him .
He did not know what to write , even though he knew the story , the characters , the plot , the twists at the end .
He knew the complexity , essence , feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write .
Suddenly , he felt his mind running in circles , spiralling into the unknown , his fingers blazing over the keyboard faster than he had ever done it before , and the words assembled , gathered , became sentences , structured organisations of semantic meaning , and suddenly , the chapter was finished .
He had no doubts that the inspiration came from above .
He closed the writing program and when asked whether or not to save the changes , he pressed " Do n't Save " as he always did after not writing anything , and then put on his jacket to go for a walk to celebrate .
He went out the door , and turned on his heel , looking in at his computer with a strange sensation in his stomach .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Hello , my name is Rolle .

Dear Sir ,
I am writing regard to your request about recommending some place to visit for your students .
To be honest , four hours is not much when it comes to sightseeing my city and I have been thinking about it a lot , but in the end I think I may have got a perfect idea .
I do not know if you heard about our old castle .
It 's in the very centre of the town , so it is very close to the hostel you are staying in .
We can visit it , it is open from eight till twelve ( I checked it ) , they have wonderful exhibitions there - paintings , sculpturs , something from the history and a little bit more modern as well .
The best part is , at 1 p.m. there is going to be a concert .
My friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as a acompaniament to the slideshow of old photographs from 19th century .
I think the best would be if we go together at ten in the morning , see some paintings for two hours , then go for ice cream or pizza , or whatever kids would like to have during the break , and then get back to the castle for the show .
Later we can do whatever you would like to do .
If you have any questions , just write or call me on my cellphone - 123 456 .
Yours faithfully ,
Sevastian Duźniak
When I started to think about my favourite sport , it was quite difficult for me to decide since I 'm very keen on sport practising .
As long as I can remember back in time , I 've always being engaged in sports .
Nevertheless , if I had to choose one among all of them , running could be consedered my favourite one .
Running is one of the cheapest and easiest sports to be practised anywhere and at any time .
The only thing you need to do it is just feeling like spending half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
An issue which is becoming increasingly debated is whether or not fox hunting should be banned .
In today 's society it is an outdated and barbaric " sport " which , in my opinion , should be banned .
In this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare .
Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals , which are going to be slaughtered , should be transported .
These measures include the time the animals spend on the road , how much room they have etc .
etc .
However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs .
This , apparantly , is a sport .
The Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes .
Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government .
It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators .
At least if one dog fights another the fight is , in some , fair .
But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others .
The fox stands no chance , why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned .
Fox hunting is , for the most part , enjoyed by the upper - class .
It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse , dogs and riding equipment ( eg .
helmet , boots etc . )
you also need land to do it in .
It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox - hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class , wealthy supporters who fox hunt .
In a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox .
The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( eg . when banning whaling ) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals ( eg . the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests ) .
But when it comes to ceasing the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britains few natural animals they seem to turn a blind eye .
According to people who partake in fox hunting it is an enjoyable sport .
A sport is when two evenly matched teams or individuals partake in a game for enjoyment or a prize .
It could be grossly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven as the result would be a foregone conclusion .
If one boxer had to fight ten boxers this would be unfair .
But matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight to the death is still considered a sport .
Cricket is a sport the brutal chase and killing of a fix for the enjoyment of the upper - class is not .
Famous people , such as politians and film stars and other celebrities are ordinary people , as we are .
People always idolise them and think that they are unusual , but they simply have extraoridinary careers .
First of all , everybody deserves to have your private life without journalists , even though he or she lives in the limelight .
They should be able to spend their time with children , families , friends etc . to go on holidays , to celebrate something .
On the other hand , I think that it 's impossible that this kind of prople have private lifes , because fans and society want to know everything about them , about their private life .
They want to be in touch with their idols , to contact and to meet them in reality .
To sum up , if we are famous person we should bear in mind that fans will admire us , and journalist will come over us , take photos of us and print them in gossip magazines or tabloids ( all that to the needs of the fans ) .
Stars should realise that they are in the centre of attention .
In addition , they should choose what is more important to them - career or private life ?
Dear Sir or Madam ,

When the time arrived for Lucy to make the transition from being a teenager to an adult , all her self - assurance and determination vanished in the thin air .
She had been a brilliant student at high school and intended to keep on being it .
She expected to work and study , all at the same time .
She had big plans but sometimes you have to slow down to achieve them .
She was going to study journalism and to do some part - time job in the meanwhile .
And she went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in a market but by the end of the month reality hit her in her face .
She started to be exhausted and her performance at university was deficient .
She needed to stop working or studying because her health was at risk ; she fell asleep in class and work , her diet was poor and her temper was disgusting .
She could only understand how disastrous was her life when she got to the limit .
Even though nobody pushed her to , she was taking too many responsibilities that she was n't able to accomplish .
' Why are you running when you 're just learning to walk ? '
One of her friends told her once .
' I want to make my future and I do n't want to waste time , ' she retorted , but was she happy ?
Since then , she started to ask herself a lot of questions and doubts were her faithful companions .
During the week of exams she suffered from her first panic attack .
That was the sign that it was definitely the time for a change .
A friend of her took her to a therapist and after a few sessions she began to catch a glimpse of what was all about .
' Success is not final , failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue what counts . '
Said her therapist
There was the clue finally .
She would have to work on that all her life , though .
Her biggest challenge was learning to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day so she 'd have to enjoy the way and give her best over and over again .

How important is for you read books in English ?
In my opinión is important because it improve my vocabulary and help me to express ideas easily .
could you tell me if you have Reading habits to learn English ?
I do n't have reading habits to learn English , in my opinion it is a custom that I had to have learned when I was a children because I would have grow with the reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
Do you think that is difficult for you create the habit to read to learn English ?
I think that is difficult for me create reading habits because I do n't like it but I think is possible if I practical it .
Most of the infant educators , psychologists and professionals of the education 's world think that using storytelling in early childhood education is good for their development .
But … is it that good ?
Does storytelling have any disadvantage ?
Using storytelling is a good way to work on values and their emotions , as they are too young to express them by themselves .
They see themselves in the main character , and through his experience they can learn how to act in these situations .
For instance , if the story is about fear ( Emotion which makes them feel insecure ) and ends up in a good way , they will have different methods to overcome their fear and feel more secure and self - confident .
Furthermore , they can take part and build up their own stories .
Their vocabulary will increase at the same time they are working on their sociability abilities .
In addition , they can see that every act has consequences they have to be responsible .
However , there are some points that need to be considered .
Storytelling must be chosen according to the age of the pupils .
One of the reasons storytelling may not work is because some teachers expect more than their pupils can do .
Moreover , if the story is too long or dull they will lose concentration easily and make their classmates lose it too .
To sum up , we must take advantage of storytelling to consolidate concepts , values and emotions and let imagination go .
I live in one of the biggest city in the country .
People who live in our city generally face transportation problems .
Instead of long term solutions , local authotorities are focus on short term solutions .
The quality of public transportation vehicles can be increased .
New form of public transportation must be supported by the government .
People should be convinced to use public transporters .
The human brain is the most powerful computer known to man yet it is small and light .
It is the control centre of a body , can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings , it is able to interact with other humans and objects .
The brain can make decisions , it can communicate .
The only function of the brain which computers can rival is the memory .
Some of the humans brains functions have been taken over by computer . like accountancy . with the invention of electronic calculators .
In fact the whole subject of mathematics has become quicker with the invention of the electronic calculator .
but the subject has not changed electronics have only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
Most of the theories used today were Hypothesised and proved before the invention of the calculator .
Computers however have almost unimaginable accuracy .
Most high precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to make parts accurate to thousandths of a millimeter .
The computer is very widley used in the modern day world , but in almost every case it is only an aid to the brain .
The human still has to tell the computer what to do .
The human is still in charge .
The human brain is in no way made redundant by the invention of the computer and I think that it will be a long time before the technology is discovered to make a electronic machine which will compete with the brain to achieve one of its functions never mind all of which the human brain is capable of doing .
Hello Tara .
You are starting an amazing project for your life .
I know it is really difficult to start but then it starts being easier .
You can start asking your teacher and your schoolmates if they want to be part of that .
They will probably say yes .
Together you can decide what to do .
At my school I 've made that and it resulted .
We started by create rules to respect the environment ... I do n't want to tell you more ideas because it is important to be original ,
Good luck

If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate then the roads will be completely congested .
This is the main problem facing the UK 's transport system .
The reasons for this are many and varied .
People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income , both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership .
Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places , and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car , as they believe , correctly or not , that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets .
These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case , and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today .
People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish , and can travel " door - to - door " instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations .
The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people , due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
Rail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years , due to the immense popularity of the car now .
Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services .
Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars , as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
I think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses , trains and other forms of public transport .
The government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements , such as the widening of motorways .
This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport , with more services on the timetables , lower rates and less delays .
These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead .
This would lead to less congested roads , which could then be used efficiently by people with not other option , and a less polluted environment for all of us to live in .
This is because public transport is less polluting than personal car useage .
Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products .
Several years ago the disease BSE or ' Mad Cow Disease ' became quite commonplace amongst cattle .
The disease incurs a mental deficiency , where the cow can not think for itself , and slowly dies .
This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers ; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead , meatstripped cows .
Now , scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans , as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld - Jacob Disease ( CJD ) appearing more frequently .
There is , as of yet , no cure for this disease , and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products .
This clearly has put a lot of people off beef , as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
The disease can take upto 15 - 20 years to become evident in humans , so even if people gave up beef today , they will have a chance of getting CJB .
However , to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future .
If a lot of people did give up beef products , this will have had effects on the agricultural industry .
Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no - one wants to buy their meat .
It will affect other animals being sold for meat also ; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so - on so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products .
If no - one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk , which means there will be less cows in the future possibly .
If cows are no longer required by the public for food , some abbattoir workers may lose jobs , and several butchers , to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income , may be hit hard by this .
The politicians still say it is safe , and that they will continue to eat beef .
However , a lot of these people are old , and by the time the disease has developed in them it wo n't really be too much of a premature death .
However , for us young people is the risk too great ?
I haven't stopped eating it .

Sometimes , we play bowling if all friends is free at night .
" Seven " can be categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie , people consider is a moving gripping .
The main characters were interpreted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt , one of the most highly regarded fact was that in total the film grossed more than 330 million of euros in 1995 when the film was premiered .
It is directed by David Fincher who has also be in charge of " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " and it is a Paramount production .
The film narrates a series of murders that are related to the seven deadly sins ( lust , pride , wrath , laziness , greed , gluttony)made by a psychopath who left a mark on each victim to deduct the sin for which they had been killed .
This lead to the research of two policemen that tried to fit perfectly well all the pieces of the crime , but it is going to be more difficult that they expected .
I personally think that this film is fast - moving and spine chilling I found it astonishing , I freely appreciate that no way there is a happy ending and there are unpleasant scenes due to some murder scenes .
if you like mystery films I strongly recommend it .
I sincerely hope this review convinces the reader to watch the film .
Dear Joe ,
thanks for your letter .
I 'm very glad you have thought about visiting my country .
I 'm sure you will like it .
I can give you some tips for traveling , depends on what do you like to do .
If you like museums , galleries and architecture , I would recommend you to visit our beautiful cities , like Wroclaw , Krakow , Poznan , Gdansk , and of course our capital Warsaw .
On the other hand , if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should rather think about going to our mountains - Sudety or Karpaty , or to Mazuria region , full of lakes .
You may combine it as well .
For example , you may go by plane to Warsaw , visit the city , then take a trip to the north , including our sea - which , unfortunately , is n't the most warm and pretty sea in the world .
Honestly , you can skip it without hesitating .
But our lakes are really worth visiting .
They are many possibilities there , to spend you free time .
You can go horse - riding , swimming , kate - surfing , fishing etc .
Next , we could meet in Wroclaw .
I would show you the city , which I like very much .
Then , I would take you to the mountains .
You may finish your trip in Krakow , and then look for a job there or in Warsaw .
There are our two biggest cities , with many students , and many job offers available .
As you speak Polish very little , it will be also the easiest way to find an appropriate work for you , for an English - speaking company or so .
I believe Poland is a very good place for you .
The landscape is beautiful , and people are very friendly .
Let me know if you need any more help .
Looking forward to hear from you soon .
Best regards ,
Ewa
The 0th Century Invention that has had one of the most radical effects on people 's lives is the television .
During the 1950 's , America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution .
The era of Populuxe instigated a ' must - have ' ideology in the nation and the most important ' must - have ' was , of course , the television .
The presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass culturization of various grupes , the commercialization of our lifestyles , and the rapidity and breath of the information that reaches us .
Gathered around the tube , the American family learned the ' ideal ' way of life .
But the picture of perfection was the same in every home .
We all received the same information .
We all saw the same families , The Cleavers and The Andersons , etc . telling how we should behave .
Mother was always beautiful , father knew best , and children had cute , silly , harmless problems .
As a result of this omniscient picture , a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of .
People in N.Y. watched Green Acres .
Today the same trend continues .
To white people , Ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery .
The examples on television are blown - up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
Rather than several small , isolated cultures , the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization
and the presence of another 's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason .
Another effect of the television on people 's lives is the commercialization of our lives .
Advertisements , which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , have developed into an art form .
15 second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars and as a result the American population is made to laugh , or to cry , and often times to buy a product .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of America have experienced w/ the advent of the television a great increase in the amount of information they receive , as well as in the time it takes to reach them .
A hundred years ago , different sections of the country ( and world ) were isolated and separated by the time it takes to mail a letter and print a newspaper story .
Today , we know within seconds , or in the case of the space - shuttle challenger explosion , we know live - immediately .
This abundance of information has lead to a drastic alteration in peoples ability to react to major events .
Our view of the world is different , it 's closer , it 's in our livingrooms .
A good example of this is the reaction to the vietnam war .
The war was , indeed , unpopular with or w / o television .
But the reality of what we saw , the casualty counts , the bloody children under the American flag , did much to enhance the negative aspects of war .
Overall the television has caused a radical change in our lives-
we are open to manipulation as well as stimulation .
The television a powerful and dangerous tool .
It can greatly inhance and improve our lives , but it is most important to be aware of the fact that it is a manipulator .
We must watch what we watch .
I do n't agree with the statement saying there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
When you decide to travel by car , it 's certain that you feel independent , you can stop whenever you need , you can set off when you are ready and that is why travelling by car is said to be convenient .
However , there are sometimes more important thngs than feeling comfortable when travelling like money . Travelling by car is expensive , as the price of a petrol is still increasing , because of limited natural resources .
Although , there are some places in the entire World where car - users can not complain about the price of a petrol , there are also many more areas where people exchange driving cars for commuting or riding a bike as they ca n't afford owning a car .
Nowadays we are much more aware of the environment .
Thus , we know that using cars is harmful for the environment . We are advised to take public means of transport instead of travelling alone as it means less exhausted fumes per one passenger .
What is more , in multiple countries there is a festival of public transport , when people celebrating travel free by public transport and they are asked to leave their private car in the garage .
To sum up , in my opinion public transport will remain as long as the scientists did n't discover new natural resources of petrol or invent a cheap equivalent to charge cars with .
We do not care about the big environment in China , but we only care about the environment in or around our own house .
We through all kinds of housing waste into the same basket , and the cleaner will collect it .
Sometime there will be odor remain , as the basket is indoor .
We do not care about the air , even the air pollution is very serious in some part of China .
We only choose the way which is convenient but may have negative effect on our living environment .
Dear Jo ,
Spain has many beautiful places you ought to see .
I think you should start of in Madrid , so we can meet , I 'll show you around .
We 'll go to all the touristic places and you 'll get to try a lot of delicious food .
Then you should visit Barcelona it 's a truly beautiful city with many must - see places like the Sagrada Familia , also you 'll be able to go to the beach to relax .
From there on I think you could follow the coast and visit cities such as Valencia , Cartagena or Málaga during the summer and leave the inland cities for autumn .
As for working here , well , it 's not going to be easy , we 're having difficulties regarding that , but I guess you could find a part - time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sendig your CV and all that .
And if everything fails , we can always ask my aunt , she owns a small shop in the city centre and she 'd be more than happy to have someone helping her out .
See you soon
Sam
Hi Jo ,
in my country there are a lot of chances to work and to have fun .
Italy is in an enormous country full of culture and opportunities .
For example I live in Jesolo , near Venice , and here there are business companyies other hotels , other firms , if you want you can also do the touristic guide .
On travelling in my view point , I think taht the best thing is to strat , for example from bottom of Italy and visit all the amazing cities in these countries : Florence , Milan , Genoa , Rome , Venice .
There are also a lot of courses other activities to do .
You have a lot of opportunities also with Universities .
Venice and Padova are the most important cities for learn .
It 's a great idea .
I hope I can see you soon , and I hope to be useful for your decision .
As you may already notice , Warsaw is a beautiful and a big city .
It was really hard to choose one place , that you just must visit .
Obviously it largely depends on your interests .
If you want to know Warsaw from historical side I recommend visiting the Old Town and
The Royal Castle .
It would be helpful for you if you ask for a guide .
Honestly , I think it is very educational , but a bit boring .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely more appreciate something less educational , but more interesting .
Your must - visit place is The National Stadium .
I was there many times and trust me - there is a lot to see there .
It was built specially for EURO 2012 .
We were host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
The first thing which attracts our attention is an interesting architecture .
It looks like a red and white - it refers to Poland 's flag - basket .
The stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch , training pitch , façade lighting , and underground parking .
There is even a railway station , situated in the opposite , which was built in the same style as the stadium .
When you get there you will not be disappointed .
There are trips with a guide where you will hear story of the Stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
You will also visit changing rooms where football players prepare to match .
It is a multipurpose venue able to host not only sporting events , but also concerts , cultural events , and conferences .
I really recommend visiting this place .
It would be unforgettable and fascinating trip .
It would also be a great windfall for all football lovers .
You will not regret that , I promise .
Life changes could be possible in the next years because actually a new way of life is appearing due to technology advantages .
When I look back I realise teenagers are different , they are looking for different things for their life .
For example , when I was young , all students used to study for several years to become an expert and get a good job .
Nowadys teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
All around me is changing quickly , education , way of life , way of thinking , technology so I think all that will make a change in the life of the future .
In fact , I am looking forward to see this change and I hope this change will be as good as I expect , above all I hope a big change in the health service will be made .
With the economic development , a growing number of much - need buildings are take the place of areas of farmland , forest and wetland .
As far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to citiziens as well as animala than good .
First , the large - scale buildings bring varieous kinds of pulltions .
The process of building produce a large amount of marteial rubbish as well as noise , which disturbing the life of inherits around .
On the same time , the glass covering the surface of hte skysrcaper reflect daxzzling light .
Besides , the destory of the habitat fasten the extinction of wildings and redue the diversity of speices .
Withno more trees and glasses to fresh the air , the air pollution will be more serious .
What 's more , building housing much more than needed is the waste of socity resouces .
To solve those problems , stagyies should be taken by the government .
First , the measure should be made to protect the area of farmland , forest and wetland .
Each city should be promised to own the least needed afforesting area .
What 's more , the government should encouraged invested into enviroment - firendly project instead of housing building .
The last is that
Presents
In regard to a recent radio discussion about the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as luxuries , homemade items o different live experiences , the decision is open to debate .
On the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time whether it is for Christmas , Birthdays or just because you want to demonstrate someone how much you care for them .
Live experiences are known for being the best type of present nowadays , as people finally understood the importance of memories for our lives , instead of just collecting luxuries , clothes or photographs .
Moreover , from my point of view , apart from having the amazing opportunity to receive this type of gift , you are able as well to share it with the people you love the most .
In addition , I do not actually find any disadvantage to this type of present .
On the other hand , homemade items are extremely agreeable to receive too .
Not only they are made with true love , but also they are made , generally , with recycling products , such as glass , plastic and even wood .
The main advantage is the fact that , as it was said before , the item was probably made with passion .
However , the person who receives the present may not like it at all .
That is the main disadvantage .
These ideas had led me to my conclusion : the best present to receive are experiences as you will always remember them , sharing them with your family and acquaintances .
My teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course that based on theories in second language acquisition .
Until now , my beliefs in teaching English focuses on the following opinions : ( i ) children should be familiarity with English as early as possible ( ii ) the teacher should give students motivation so that they can gain their target goal in learning language ( iii ) teacher must be a good monitor in class ( iv ) the teacher must be well interaction with students .
My beliefs help me feel more confident to become an English teacher in the future .
First of all , parents should let their children learn English early .
My first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire second language better than children .
By reading child language acquisition of SLA , I know that the period that people can acquire the second language best is in childhood ( McLaugh , 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.123 ) .
Moreover , children at the age between 5 and 9 that called critical period , they can acquire second language naturally that do not need any special methods of teaching .
Children have better phonology than adults and they display morphological sensitivity that adults can not .
However , older learners will be successful in second language ( L2 ) syntax .
Patkomski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned L2 after the age of puberty received lower proficiency scores than learners who started learning L2 before puberty .
Therefore , in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their child make an acquaintance with English as early as possible to help their children have accent like native speakers .
If I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities which focus on communications skills and give students opportunities to expose with authentic input such as cartoons , music , etc .
Secondly , the teacher should inspire to students motivation and raise student 's awareness in learning so that they can gain their target goal in learning language when I was in grade ten , I did not have willingness motivation to learn English because of my parents ' obligation .
Consequently , my results do not meet the goal as my parents expected .
Until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I passed the exam in class with high mark , and I have motivation to learn better .
I want to become an English teacher .
Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA that makes students achieve in learning L2 ( Skehan,1989 , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.426 ) .
Students can use their whole time to do what they are interested in , and they will never get bored .
The more motivated one has been in language learning , students will gain the more successful .
It is really a long - term project that students can improving their proficiency in second language .
They need to observe number of comprehensible input , and do many tasks to obtain their goal .
As a teacher , I will make efforts to increase the students frequency motivation because of its the changes overtime Dörnyei and Ottó ( 1998 ; and detailed in Dörnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.428 ) .
Thirdly , the good teacher is the one that can well - organized all of activities in class .
For instance when I teach grammar , I have to define how many structure that I can teach in a lesson is enough , and with some difficult grammar rules , I need to break it to teach in turn .
Learners need time to memory the new rule and acquired in their learned system .
After teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure base on my cue cards .
When they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say , so I can know whether they are acquired the rules or they just use their learned knowledge .
Finally , interaction is also an interesting theory .
Gass ( 2003 ) found that " language learning is stimulated by the communication of pressure and the relationship between communication and acquisition and the mechanisms " .
Therefore , I will teach my students by English only , I will let them have more chance to communicate with other one through my tasks that I give them in class , then I will move around the class room and correct mistakes for them by negotiation , recasts or feedback .
When observing their dialogue , if they make mistakes , I will take note and after they finished their practice , I will correct it for them .
I advise interrupting their speech because it is unrespected them .
In addition , if I always correct mistakes , my students will lose their confident and they would not like to practice anymore .
This is my philosophy on foreign language teaching .
These my beliefs help me examine what I am going to do in the future when I become an English teacher .
This course widen my knowledge a lot through the theories in SLA book .
I think that students in school of foreign language education must learn this course to have better philosophy of teaching .
The aim of this report is to describe how my town takes care of the environment and what people do with respect to the issue .
Firstly , I am going to talk about what my town do .
The town is generally clean , thanks to the clean services .
Every night roads are cleaned and the rubbish is frequently collected during the day .
even if the clean service is very efficient , people do n't usually take care of the environment .
They throw their wrappers away on the ground .
In other words , citizens do n't completely worry about the place where they live .
the town has implemented a programme to solve this problem promoting prizes to who takes action against these bad behaviour .
As a result of this new policy , the town is now more attractive and cleaner than in the past .
Residents have changed their bad habits and the image of the town has improved .
In conclusion , thanks to the new living way , tourists are more attracted and curious to visit it and the town has reduced the costs to clean .
The amount of money saved is used to build new green areas across the town .
European nations have over time been linked together both in war and in Peace .
These countries have since been moving closer together on more institutional lines .
One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community , made up from the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community .
In 1987 , the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992 .
This act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or not it will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
The lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade .
This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe .
However , the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers .
This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted .
British sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain .
A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision - making ability .
The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created .
It believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns , however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do .
If the European Community was to bring in a single currency , Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality , but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange .
Currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept .
If a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of its own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .
It would mean a supranational force fighting as a whole , with no real difference between them - it would not be a case of " one force , one nation " .
However , the state would still exist as an island and people will always feel that they were british due to their roots and history .
This even if linked physically to Europe via the Channel Tunnel , Britain would still see itself as a separate country .
I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based on an economic level of free trade between nations .
However , if a strong European government was created which made important decisions for Britain , such as currency settlements and the running of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with power to make its own decisions , and would hence lose its sovereignty .
The picture shpows the process of making notes .
First is to design it that is the most important progess , escaping from copy , then it can be printed.when this are finished .
Make sure the quality sheets , if these are bad sheets , they will be destoryed;if there are good quality sheets , these will be packaging and distributied .
The sheets concludes about cuting into separate bank notes , packingand dispatching .
All these is the basical process.what we ues is basied on it .
Bank should make efforts to keep security for the users.through these process , we learn to know about the bank notes , it is just besise our living , wo use it to buy whatever i
This graph shows data of the amount of petrol used between the United States and the United Kingdom .
As it is known , these countries are ones of the mosst powerful regions around the world .
Firstly the United States line expresses that the majority of income percentage is spent by the poorest socioeconomic class .
Secondly , amounts of money used for cars are decreased by the richest drivers .
However this patron is not the same as the other place .
In the first place , we can appreciate a percentage of capital used on gas which is raised by wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom .
In the second place , the lowest incomes are reported on British citizens who are from a poor socioeconomic status .
Once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom have a similar patron .
According to the richest drivers , both lines are linked in the same place .
Dear Summer Camp holder :
Hi !
This is Mimi .
I am an outgoing girl enjoying getting alone with people very much .
A few years ago , I was an elementary school teacher , quitting such a nice job due to my dream in being a nurser , but that would be an obstacle slowing me down to getting along with these cute little angels .
Thus , I have a profound believe in myself to do this job well .
By the way , I once joined a summer camp during my college life .
A role who was as the same as this job , like preparing meals and snacks , holding games and giving them surprise , and taking good care of them and so on .
Though it may seem that having to do so much will be extremely exhausted to me , both my experience and instinct tell me that would be a great time with a beautiful memory left in my life .
Either hard and frustration could not change my decision , only try the difficult could a person get improved and find his way in life .
Above all , thank you for giving me such an opportunity to show myself .
If I could be your partner , that would be my greatest pleasure .
Hope all of you enjoy a nice day .
Your friend , Mimi
Dear Lionel Messi ,
I 'm writing to you , to persuade you with some information that you probably do n't know about .
I would like to say that you should give more money to charity and I think you should be paid much less than you do now .
Firstly , I would like to say that you should be paid much less than you do now .
Because you 're get paid about £ 330.000 per week .
So can you think about doctors and nurses , they save lives almost every day and you are not doing anything just playing football and have some fun with your friends .
Therefor , you should be paid about £ 250 per game .
I think that is a huge amount of money anyway .
With other words , I think you should give more money to charity because they need your help .
So I would say that in 1960s , the wage limit of money was about £ 4-£7 per week .
It took about 20 years for that wage limit to double to £ 8-£14 per week in 1980s .
When I was a kid , I was addicted to reading stories for children .
In my teens too , I used to read a lot of teen novels so much that my mother used to reproach me for sitting too long reading instead of doing my school work .
Luckily , I managed to do both , and I remember studying hard in order to get a real chance to read whatever I wanted having my mother 's consent .
Today , I realize how reading these stories got me interested in writing .
I always wondered how you start to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
Of course , a good writer must first be a good reader .
This is how I got my ambition to write .
Reading stories , poems , and novels intrigued me to write my own .
Reading what my fellow writers here said of their experiences as writers , what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel - all of that gave answers to my questions .
More than that , I found insights to my own motives and goals as a writer .
I liked the close relation of Shirley Carreira with her father and his library .
I enjoy being intimate with my books .
I love the feel and smell of them , and I prefer them over electronic versions all the time .
They make you feel like you are in touch with the magic they offer .
Books draw you in as if by a spell .
Michael is a guy very popular he is very intelligent and he enjoys going hear the history about ghost and strange things .
One day his friend told him to go to a cabin , because strange things were happening there ; he accepted inmediately .
On Saturday they were walk around the street looking for the cabin and they met an old very old cabin .
They saw a horrible ghost and he said to them two question about his life but the guys said nothing and the ghost was furious okay said he , the second question : How many years I have ?
Michael had a nervous because he did not know nothing question about it .
The ghost said : Michael said to me who want to save your family or your friend you can only save one the other person will die .
Michael after ten seconds said this : I save my family , Michael said I am sorry friend and he ran far away when Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Although Louise felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a life time .
That was her objective that she was dreaming of many years .
If I make a decision , there will be no getting back . I have to think over it .
She was speaking to herself .
She could let her parents down .
Their expectant was to send her to one of the most prestigious medical universities .
Alas , she was not sure if they care for her opinion .
Due to being humanist , Science was not the field that she was keen on .
Louise had been given a chance to go abroad .
She did not mind working long hours at entertaining places or earning little money .
Her spirit was crying for leaving her country for the United States .
She could not say if it was a judicious feeling .
Generally , Louise was said to be an indecisive person , which can be noticed especially in such cases .
The advantages of leaving weighted up the drawbacks .
Her parents seemed not to be over the moon .
The girl convinced them and made them realise that there was no world 's " end " if she had chosen her own way .
everyone is afraid of something , but a lot of people are more afraid than of catastrophic events than of things like cancer .
even though people are scared about these things , they continue to smoke and drink alcohol .
some of our fear are instinctive so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time to think about it .
our fear make us act instinctively , we react so quickly and we save ourselves .
this type of fear is a necessary and life - saving response .
there are different kinds of fear , for example phobias .
we experience phobias in situations not dangerous for our safety .
many people have phobias , but they do n't threaten their lives every day .
scientists say that phobias arise from negative experiences or traumas and that are difficult to control , but that could be prevented with the right therapy .
we know what fear thanks to the experience and culture .
we were born with small and basics fears but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . stories on TV , the internet , newspapers , increase the risk of extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry about things that do n't happen ever to us .
to better enjoy our life without being oppressed by our fears , we must be objective as we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
INTERNATIONAL SPORTS MONTHLY : Swimming
When I was younger I used to swim , and this is my favourite sport now .
When I am swimming , I like the sensation of flowing through the water .
My advice would be : Enjoy the water !
Enjoy your time swimming !
When you start to swim , you are learning a lot of new techniques , it 's like discover a new world . I do n't swim for participanting a competition but I swim to have fun .
The continual development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times .
There are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society .
One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .
Since the early 1980 's , when computers such as the Spectrum 48 K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy has followed about their effect on children .
There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child 's ability to learn .
The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the Amiga and PC , has served to deepen the " problem " .
The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children .
However , parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn .
Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children ; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
Another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace .
There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace .
The role of computers is already significant in employment areas , such as accountancy , which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers .
These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .
As the computers are : more efficient than humans , do not require payment for their work , are less temperamental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill , it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .
Another claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti - social behaviour .
The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become unsociable .
The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to , supposedly , make life easier for us .
The Internet also has another fundamental problem according to many .
The belief exists that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will remove the challenges from life .
The human brain is constantly in need of being challenged to maintain itself ; but with the introduction of the Internet , one could conduct their life without ever needing to leave the house which many believe would menace society .
However , at the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans .
No matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may be able to show , it still has to rely on the human brain to programme it and to put it into operation .
Although , there are plans to create computers which can programme themselves , ( which I , personally , feel is a very dangerous idea ) the human brain still very much controls the computer and still the ability to end the existence of computers at any given moment ; thankfully , a power computers do not have over humans .
Since I have been studying in Australia , compared with China , I realised there 's a significant difference of English study .
Formally , Chinese teachers would adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary .
However in comparison , the English Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me more opportunities to interact and converse with classmates .
After studying the EAP , I have found that time management is my weakness .
Therefore , I will discuss more about study strategies through reading related resources .
Time management is a crucial factor for productive learning .
Firstly , as described by the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by making a " daily planner " ( p.23 ) .
So I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .
Doing this helps to complete my daily tasks more efficiently .
Secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006,p.25 ) also states that scattered time in a day should be utilised and made more productive .
For instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train , or participated in conversation actively during my breaks .
I have learnt that small bits of time added together can be used very productively .
In conclusion , by researching and comparing study strategies I discovered time management is crucial to achieve productive learning .
However , to become a better learner , it is also important for students to stay focused and motivated .
In my future studies , apart from spending my time more productively , I will also set manageable short - term goals and review my plans regularly based on my study target .

How about your life ? Mine has changed a lot from the last time we kept in touch .
As I told you , new persons have come to the office .
We have established a wonderful relationship , specially with one of them .
He is very outgoing , very friendly .
He has got a fantastic sense of humor and he always makes me laugh so I can forget the bad moments .
He is very polite , generous , honest .
At work he is a creative person , as you know this is very important in our job , he always has an idea when the rest ca n't think anything .
However he can be a bit inmadure at time .
He is very keen on sports , his favourite sport is basketball as me .

I think we fit a lot we have a lot of things in common , nearly we have the same likes and dislikes .
He is a talkative person , no me , as you know I am a bit shy .
But I do n't think it will be a problem .
I must leave you know , it 's time to work .

Krashen 's theory is one of the most known and influent acquisition theories from the seventies .
Krashen presented this theory during several years in works .
It was clustered in his great work : The input hypothesis : issues and implications ( 1985 ) and it can be summarized in the next hypothesis :
• the Acquisition - Learning hypothesis ,
• the Monitor hypothesis ,
• the Natural Order hypothesis ,
• the Input hypothesis
• the Affective Filter hypothesis .
The Acquisition - Learning is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypotheses to be presented here .
It states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language .
On one hand , we have the acquisition that according to Krashen is the unconscious process children have since they are born to develop their ability in their first language .
Language acquires are not usually aware of the fact that they are acquiring that language .
They are not aware about the rules , they speak without thinking that what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to think about the errors they commit because they do not think they are doing it wrongly .
Some things " sounds " good , and others do not .
On the other hand , we have the learning process ; it implies the developing of the competence in the second language .
We use the term learning ; to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of the second language , being aware about the rules for example .
Some theorists say that children acquire , but that adults can not do it , they just learn .
But according to Krashen , the acquisition - learning process says that adults , can also acquire , the ability of picking - up languages , does not disappear when we grow up .
But at the same time , it does not mean that adults can always achieve the native language levels , or that they can have access to the same natural " language acquisition device " that children use , it is so different .
Acquisition is a powerful process in adults .
Acquisition can not be converted in learning and in the other way round .
They are two different process acquisition is the most important one , because we have to control first , the mother language , and after that the learning of more languages .
An application for teaching , according to this theory could be that the optimal way a language is learned , is through natural communication .
As a second language teacher , the best thing is to create a situation there language is used in order to fulfil authentic purposes .
This will help students , children or adults , to acquire the language instead of learning it .
Sport makes you test your limits .
You need to get ambicious , to improve , to convince .
For me , it 's symply passion .
It 's been for ever that I loved basketball .
No matter if I followed professionals on TV or watched the students on the basketball court in school - the fascination always caught me instantly .
When I was 7 years old , my father used to motivated me .
If I scored 10 times in a row from the same point , he would take me to the kiosk and let me choose as many sweets as I could manage to eat .
Of course I could n't make it .
But I did n't give up .
After many weeks , hours of training and countless frustrating moments my precision improved .
My father was stunned .
He could n't believe , that a young boy like me was able to hit so many points .
The following day , I was rewarded with the promised sweets .
Even 10 years later , my motivation did n't change .
1 . Scarlet letter box is one of the most recognizable symbol of England
2 . There is no doubt that the most young people want to be white - collar workers .
3 . All my neighbors want to vote for the Greens .
4 . I saw amazing crimson sunset yesterday
5 .
He spent his holidays near turquoise sea .
6 .
My friend was against the Reds and it was one of the reasons why he left his country .
7 .
She is in a blue mood because she lost her job .
8 .
Honey which I bought on market near my home has amber tint .
10 . That old lady looks a bit green .
Introduction
First of all this report is concerned with how spend your shopping time in Albacete .
Albacete is too easy to walk around the city center where you can came across the most of shops .
Suggestions
In the commercial zone you can find two small shopping center .
All of them have the main street between and one is in front of each other .
These two are not so big however , there are two or three small shops really original .
In contrast I would mention two big shopping center in my city .
All of them are on outskirts and there are :
- Eroski where you can find a lot of different shops .
Most of them presents in the city center too .
- El Corte Inglés where you can buy a lot of different brands along its 5 floors .
Conclusion
From my point of view it is more attractive the city center than the shopping centers .
It is a little bit stressful for me , in contrast I prefer a relaxing walk looking shop windows than indoor shopping center .
But it the depend how shopping addict you are .
Hi Dan
Thank you for your letter .
How are things ?
I am fine .
Would you mind to go with me this Saturday ?
This Saturday is the birdthday 's mum .
Yesterday I bought her a new television although she has got a old them but it is horrible .
This evening I am inviting her to the cinema .
We are watch Spiderman and after we are going to Burguer King becauses she like it however I does n't like it but there 's no accounting for taste .
Transport is an important activity in any country .
The advent of technology has been bringing about drastic changes in means of transportation from time to time .
At the same time Transport has become a very important means of development of any nation as all nations are moving towards globalization .
Public Transportation has been playing very important role in transporting people from one place to the other .
The bulk production and marketing of cars has been reducing the role of Public Transportation .
Cars have become accessible to everybody .
The people have been preferring cars to public transportation .
This trend is very dangerous to the world .
This would raise the air pollution .
Burning of fossil fuels would increase and this would increase the air pollution .
Public Transportation should be more attractive and cost effective .
Governments should encourage people to use public transportation .
People should come forward to prefer Public Transport to own vehicles .
The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE or as it is so - called " Mad Cow Disease " .
It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans due to consumption of the infected beef .
Beef production is a fairly large business in the U.K and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease .
It was discovered that British farmers were to blame , due to their various industrial techniques .
The disease originally , was carried by chickens .
When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat , the remains ( bone and organs ) were processed to provide a cheep feeding product .
Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well .
The cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) and this was when " BSE " first came about .
The correct thing to do , would have been to destroy the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life - threatening situation .
However , the farmers had money involved and did not .
When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef , their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further .
Unfortunately , unlike the chickens , the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans in their beef .
The same industrial techniques are still used today , and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health concious , the sales in beef have decreased .
It is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years .
And so , some attitudes of the public are : " Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE ? " .
Another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims .
But it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely .
It seems that more and more families have opted for chicken , pork or lamb as an alternative .
It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well .
If there is a point where supply outweighs demand , farmers will produce less beef and make less money .
It is therefore , conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product .
The doorbell rang when I was staying at home and thinking about my lost little cat .
If you knew my pet cat you would n't surprise my love to him .
His name was Timoshka and he was n't as ordinary as other cats .
He was very intelligent and could understand my words .
He always knew my voice and my mood .
If I remember rightly , I found him when he was sitting next to my house in the street .
He was so dirty that I could n't see him in the darkness .
His green eyes only were shining there .
I was pity on him and took this one into my home .
After having a bath he changed into the white kitten like a snowball .
Well , I came to my door and opened it .
There was a little girl who was living near me .
She was holding something little and dirty .
To my big surprise , this something was a cat !
This cat was mine !
How happy I was !
The topic of environmental conservation and prevention from pollution is very keen not only in my city but around the whole country .
Many people concern about enhance of productive wastes , garbage on the streets and lack of effective processing .
Nowadays we still use of traditional ways of recycling and rubbish gathering .
One crucial point is that we do not have sorting system by type of rubbish .
We collect our wastes in one bag and then throw it into the special containers which are placed in each city area .
Time to time , approximately twice in a week this rubbish is unloaded into vehicles and taken away to recycling site .
It is difficult to imagine it further process but we know exactly that plastic and rubber waste is recycled .
Regarding other stuff , I think , it could be put into containers and dug under the ground for conservation .
But there are few steps in this direction from our officials - new recycling factory was built in suburb and started to function in the last year .
But on the other hand , many citizens complain about shortage of garbage baskets and containers on the streets of our city .
Sometimes we may see such picture like someone throws away the litter straight to an embankment or a sidewalk in the center of the city polluting the streets .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
Right after she got to work , where she was nothing but a typical underestimated office worker , Anna had been informed that she ought to go see her boss and prepare to be eaten alive because of the last report .
Once she set foot on his office , she was surprised by a crowd of people yelling ' Happy birthday ! ' .
Literally everybody was there , even her husband Adam who was holding their disabled daughter in his arms . '
I 've got a real stunner for you , Anna , ' said her boss smiling like a Cheshire cat , '
Due to my upcoming retirement , I was ordered to find my replacement .
I told the management that you were the perfect choice . '
Anna was thrilled to bits - after all these years she was going to become a manager !
And yet another surprise was about to happen .
Her skirt was being pulled , out of the blue - Anna looked down and noticed her 5-year old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
It was truly astonishing !
She fell on her knees with tears of joy running down her cheeks .
She felt like she was on cloud nine .
Suddenly her whole body has started to shake .
Adam was standing at the hospital bed , staring at his wife 's body convulsions .
After long years being in a deep coma Anna 's family finally lost their hope and chose the euthanasia with an aching heart .
The teenage daughter silently shrieked and buried her head in Adam 's chest .
Shaking stopped and the long monotonous sound confirmed that Anna has just left this world for a better place .
Now she could just constantly celebrate her birthday with the beloved family .
I must say I strongly agree that shopping is not always an enjoyable experience .
To begin with , standing in a queue can get you a terrible headache .
Only ten minutes is just enough in the atmosphere of people shouting and haggling over every last penny .
Every once in a while , when you get home after shopping , it can turn out that you just bought a real pig in a poke .
The food might not have a proper freshness , especially when it comes to dairy and meat products .
Not only people ca n't afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too much money on useless goods .
It appears that the shop policy is very relevant in this particular matter .
It 's common to put products on special offers and hire some good - looking salespeople so it 's almost impossible to refuse them .
As they say , you can shop till you drop !
On the other hand , it 's not necessary to purchase anything at all .
People are shopping around these days again and again in order to compare various prices , are n't they ?
It 's funny , but they always seem to be in search of the biggest bargain in their life .
There is no doubt that browsing at the mall and not buying can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
Introduction for a paper
Supply chain involves the management and information provider of many areas in a company , it goes since the selection of raw materials , the processing of raw materials to finished goods , and transportation of that finished goods or products to end in the customers .
The main parts are the suppliers , production and distribution .
One important task is the information provided in each area in order to create a logical connection between this main parts to approach the objective of sell a good quality product with reduction in costs and time .
The definition of a standarized process is the stablishment of the same method to be applied in the production of certain activities or functions .
This method is already accepted with the require parameters .
A standardized product is the result of a standardized process .
For example , the production of a Coco - Cola bottle in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca - Cola bottle in Australia .
A standarized product must not have big deviations , in order to sell the same product for all customers .
Transport essentially constitutes our movement .
Cars ca n't always be affordable by all sections of society .
Public Transport should be optimally run in accord with the demand .
Public spending should be spent appropriately to ensure the maximum benefit done to the public .
Drive down any street in urban America and you will see young males and females , both black and white , driving Pathfinders , BMWs , Mercedes , and other luxury automobiles .
How do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides ?
They dress in Karl Kani , Pele Pele , and Guess ? clothing .
They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike footwear .
Where do the funds come from to purchase these fashions ?
In many cases the answer is simple : crime .
As unfortunate as it may sound , many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays ; and it pays well .
What alternative does an inner - city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty ?
The answer becomes apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those taking a more " conservative " path to financial security .
The philosophy is simple : if you want it , go get it -- at any cost .
The consequences are few , especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail .
The only danger that exists for a criminal come from other criminals trying to take what 's theirs .
Police are no threat as they are far outnumbered ; it is virtually a game of chance as to wether one gets caught in an act of crime .
Fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . The public calls for more police but refuse to pay the taxes needed to hire them . .
The few police on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like a dog chasing its tail .
If a criminal is apprehended , and in an odd circumstance is placed in jail for non - violent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short amount of time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable living supported by burglary , mugging , dealing , or simple con games .
Jail space is reserved for murderers and rapists first ( as it should be ) , and when a murderer is convicted and sentenced , a dealer is put back on the street .
What an ordinary citizen imagines when he or she witnesses or hears about a non - violent crime is a thug bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as he or she can get his or her hands on , etc .
In reality these criminals are merely working a job that pays them better than any other .
Why work at McDonalds where you are forced to work in a hot , cramped atmosphere , possibly with an overbearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no en in sight , making $ 5.00 an hour and shopping at K - Mart for clothes ?
It is obvious that crime pays .
The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and rolling wads of money into their designer jeans .
This is less of a choice than it is an act of taking advantage of an opportunity .
There are few alternatives for low - income youths , and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash .
With violent crime rising and financial support for more police falling , crime will continue to pay .
If you are looking for a film about teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend you to watch Endless Love .
This is a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film , but instead of an age difference , there 's a class difference .
Directed by Shana Feste , the film shows the throas of teenage first love , when David , the smart , decent , blue - collar guy who 's happy to go into business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with Jade , a wealthy , sheltered and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University .
The class difference between their families becomes a great deal for both .
The films features Alex Pettifer and Gabriella Wilde in the lead roles .
With his handsome face and gentleman actitude , and her perfect siluete , both try to live with their different life styles together .
They will fight against everything to protect their inoscent love .
Both acts their parts perfectly but there are brilliant performances from the rest of the cast as well .
Another thing of this movie that you will love is the cinematographic effects .
The romantic scenes and the music produce the perfect atmosphere for this type of film .
Finally , the script is wonderful , lovely and touching , like David and Jade should be .
If you enjoy cheesy love movies , I definitely recommend you to watch Endless Love .
It is undenied that housing and transport networks are very important for us , plenty of people choose to build these in the areas of foamland , forest and wetland , which destoy the animals ' living areas and pollute the environment we live .
In my opinion , it is time for governments to take measures .
To begin with , The energy in the world is limited , in other words , what we eat and what we need is depend on the farming and forset , if we run out of the resourses , building more large - scale buildings , finally there would be a desater .
As for the animals , serious of large - scale building are build , they can not live in the forest , and have to move into another places , according to the China Daily , it has published that three elephants came into the town , and ate the crops.that is because their habitat were build into roads , Many kinds of animals have to change their living habits , adapting to what the people had done .
For the sea species , many visiting boats are put into the sea , polluted the ocean , leading to high death rate .
To sole these intractable problems , the governments need to take measures .
FOr example , education is the key to arise people'respomsibilty , govenrnment can teach through the public media.the acan also allow the organizations to go aroud the world , spread the prombles the areas had destoryed.these perhaps lomg tern solutions , but the are more realistic soluctiona than setting up yet another international organization .
One of the greatest inventions of all time it is a television .
The invention that swept the world and changed leisure habits for countless millions was pioneered by Scottish - born electrical engineer John Logie Baird .
It had been realised for some time that light could be converted into electrical impulses , making it possible to transmit such impulses over a distance and then reconvert them into light .
And now it is become a one of the most important mass media .
Millions of people all over the world like to watch TV in their spare time .
It informs , educates and entertains them .
It influence the way people look at the world and makes them change their views .
TV simply helps us to relax after a hard day 's work , giving a great variety of entertaining and musical programs .
But there are some opinions that television is doing a lot of harm .
People begin to forget how to occupy their free time .
It prevents them from communicating with each other , from visiting friends , or relatives .
And indeed , people used to have hobbies , they used to go outside for amusements to the theatres , cinemas , sporting events .
They used to read books and listen to music .
Now all free time is given to television .
Still , it 's not a good thing for children to be glued to the TV screen all day long .
It 's very harmful for their health and for developing personalities , because children prefer low - standard hits , horror films or banal serials .
I 'm not such a passionate TV viewer .
In fact I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful .
I relax when I watch musical shows , humorous programs and TV games .
To my mind , all this things depend on life style of people .
Nevertheless , television has obviously changed the society , and it 's probably used more than any other type of mass media .

Dancing your problems away
Dancing has been my favourite sport since I was very small .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move your body and perhaps , without them I would n't be right now in a street dance crew whie taking ballet lessons .
Does n't it just make everyone feel positive about dancing ?
Throughout the history , dancing has developed into an easy task and everyone can learn it .
Recent studies show that , whenever you are downcast or having issues , this sport stimulates your senses and has a great impact on your body and nervous system .
Recent addition include a healthy life , with an impact on your lifestyle .
It is a highly popular sport , furthermore , it provides a lot of benefits .
why not think about it ?
You 'll find out that every time a rapid song comes up , you 'll need to move even though you are sitting on a chair .
Instead of sitting down , you should take on the actual challenge and have fun .
Dancing is not intended for a special group of age , so everyone can start it .
The only advice would be to clear off the negative mood existing in your head , forget about the setbacks and just wind down .
As long as you enjoy yourself , you 'll do excellent .
In conclusion , if you want a different kind of experience , go out and try .
The family is the most valuable and priceless gift that someone has ever had .
Having a family means having everything .
The strong and special bond we have with our family is unbreakable , is that one powerful and magic connection that lasts forever .
Friends come and go , but your family will always be there for you .
When you 're at your worst , friends leave , they become strangers through the night and the next day they do n't even bother to say hello .
We will never know for sure how many of our friends are real ones and how many just fake a friendship , but there 's one thing that we can be sure of : our family is our best friend .
Friends ca n't always be relied on , they are willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
But you can count on your family 's full support whenever you need it .
The family is where we grew up , where we were thought what love and kindness mean , the treasure that provided us with the warmth of a home .
We 'll never go and ask a stranger for help , we 'll go and ask for our mother or grand - mother 's wise advice because it is a thousand times more valuable .
I believe that the infinte love that our family has for us is the most significant proof that we could never find a better best friend than our own family anywhere else throught the world because since the day of our birth we were lucky enough to be given the best ones , our ireplaceable family .
A lot of teenagers are jealous of famous people asuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy and fun .
But what about the price they have to pay for their outstanding lifestyle ?
No dought , young people are sure that celebrities enjoy life , most of them only dream about .
At the same time they forget a very important thing .
Film and pop stars , pliticians , models , are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
More over hundred 's of fans and paparazzi are hunting for them and even sometimes abuse of their private environment .
Beeing in public is the main part of their profession .
On the other hand , they have families of their own , close relatives , and they have the right to their personal pastime .
In my opinion , famous people deserve admiration due to their abilities and talents , though we should not only adore them , but respect as well .
Much has occured in the 20th century that has changed the way people live .
The invention that comes to mind as being the most influential is the computer .
This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work .
The first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations a second .
With the advancement in technology and the move toward miniaturization , the desktop PC has evolved .
These small , relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their predecessors did and much more .
Every day new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools .
The impact of computers on the world has been great .
They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information is dealt with .
In short , the productivity of people has increased ten - fold .
As we move into the 2st century this fact will become more important .
The amount of information that is available in the world will require the use of computers to organize and extract that which is of interest .
The personal computer has , and will continue to play a major role in our lives .
The day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have their own PC linked by cellular modem to the databases of the world , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will replace the printed page .
We have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th century miracle .
We are limited only by our imaginations
and the future of this invention looks " bright " indeed .
The Cherepovets match factory " FESKO " is the leading company in a match branch of industry .
It is the largest manufacturer of matches in the post - Soviet space and the Europe .
At the same time , the company continues to grow , increasing production and strengthening its position in the market .
The first try of the build The Cherepovetsk match factory was in 1948 year , when a building of the factory on the beach of the river Yagorba began .
But a set of equipment for the matches production were not received .
The building was developed into a pipe plywood plant .
The match factory was built only in 1970 .
It was planned to buy an equipment for the production in Sweden , but eventually the factory was equipped with domestic positional equipment .
Then the Cherepovetsk factory capacity were almost the worst in the industry .
General reconstruction of the company began in 1981 .
Five " Arenko " automatic production lines were mounted during three years , and at the end of technology modernization 70% of the equipment has been replaced by brand - new ones .
And it was the beginning of ascent into a leading position in the industry .
Since 2012 , " FESKO " has been caring out a large - scale modernization , which cost more than 200 million rubles .
Fitness .
I would like writing about fitness because it 's a topic very interesting to me because I live in a family where no one ever stops .
We usually do jogging , it 's very healthy because heart beat can improve if someone run constantly at a low speed .
But I know that jogging is a sport that many people hates because it 's tiring so luckily there are infiny sports and each of us can choose the best for him .
I find very useful aerobic because is based on physical exercise combined with music , it 's very funny .
Unfortunately most people do n't take physical exercise seriously because most people are lazy , anyway I think that the exercises should be an integral part of our lives .
Obviously , fitness also depends on diet .
The healthier you eat , the fitter you are .
That 's a big advice but no one , also me , can give up on sweets .
Normally , people go to a gym to feel and to look better .
When you feel good with yourself , you enjoy life more and you even have more protection against illness .
In fact , it 's for this reason that I extend the hours of physical education at school .
Sport helps not only th body but also the mind , it helps to vent the nervous and it makes you free .
Do it for yourself , at the beginnen it will be hard but at the end you 'll be satisfied
During my time as a teacher , I used to organise many group activities .
An example that I would like to provide was during my induction year , when I had to select and organise a group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
When I was selecting the group , I had to take into account each student background and motivations in order to have mixed and cooperative learning .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessary to accomplish the task and also , to deliver instructional materials .
I used plenty of positive reinforcement to encourage everyone to participate , because they were a low ability group with low levels of motivation , and they were not used to win in any challenge .
Whilst the students were producing artwork to sell in order to raise funds , I used to supervise and monitor tasks giving feedback about the accomplished ones and how they could improve them .
The campaign was a success , and the group was awarded with the prize of the most solidary students within the national context .
To begin with , obviously everybody has a right to his or her own privacy .
There is no doubt that nobody wants to be stalked - it is uncomfortable and annoying .
Even a star wants to have a little piece of quite from time to time .
Surely a journalist or a paparazzi can be wrong in making their judgments .
It does n't matter if someone is a celebrity or an ordinary human being - I believe a misleading gossip can ruin anyone 's life .
On the other hand , sometimes big stars would n't be so famous if they were n't chased by some paparazzi .
As a matter of fact , it appears that some people want to be followed on purpose - to gain more fame of course .
A bad reputation often seems to be the shortest way to bathe in a glory .
Also journalists deserve to earn a living and make good stories for their editors , especially if it is an exclusive on some big event .
Finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price for staying in limelight .
Famous people are forced to live with it whether they like it or not .
I agree that celebrities should n't be constantly followed by journalists but if they truly wanted their privacy to be respected , they would n't be involved in so many public scandals - there are people who just love getting others ' attention .
The diagram exhibit the changes during the last ten years in the quantities of immigrants to Australia .
It separetes in nine world regions .
The ones that shows significant decrease are Europe and Asia .
Moreover , India , East and America have only a very small decrease .
However , the regions of Oceania and Africa really increased .
Overall , the chart shows that there has been a decrease in immigration .
Nowadays there are a lot of famous people in our society who are facing the lack of privacy .In my opinion they deserve to have as much privacy as possible .
They are ordinary people with the same needs as everybody else .
However as they are famuos they receive a lot more attention from media and fans than we could imagine .
The unstopable vast amount of attention is usually worse thing than good .
Everybody wishes to have as much privacy as possible .
It is unbearable for famuos people to deal with journalists when they go shopping or anywhere else .
Can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists taking a picture of every step you make ?
I can guarantee that none of us would appreciate a life style like that .
I can firmly say that famuos people like politicians and filmstars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Students finished school at the age of 16 .
They are very young but I believe that young people should have the chance to go their own way .
In my opinion it is a good experience for young people to leave the school at the age of 16 because they
have the chance to get practical experience .
People tend to look to the black side .
I think there are two good reasons for going to work at the age of 16 .
Firstly ,
because they are young and motivated and some students are glad to finish studying .
Secondly , it is so important to learn as much as you can when you are young .
On the other hand , they are not old enough to know what they want to do their whole live .
I think it is hard to get prepared for the real live .
Teachers do their best
but is it enough ?
However , the system is working and it would be hard to improve it .
Everybody has the opportunities to make his own decision .
Nowadays more and more people tend to have a healthy lifestyle .
Everybody wants to be healthy and to visit his doctor only once per year for health evaluation .
However , living a healthy life style is not easy , it is require following next steps , such as : eating a healthy diet , exercising regularly , and getting enough sleep at night .
Physical activity is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle .
Regular exercise not only keeps your body physically strong , but also reduces the like hood of getting many health related problems and increases tolerance to stressful situations .
It is a fact that physical exercise makes stronger our skeleto - muscle system .
Well - developed and strong vertebral muscles keep our body in the right vertical position , so vertebral deformation will not develop and a back pain will not occur .
Indeed , doing a special type of a gym activity called " cardio " improves blood circulation in internal organs and in the heart .
Accordingly , risk of cardio - vascular diseases decreases .
Also , everybody knows that strong positive or negative emotions , due to certain hormonal reactions , have an impact on a heart work .
In a regular person a heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically and even cause a stroke or a heard attack .
In trained people will increase intention of heart contractions and stroke volume .
The heart rate will be changed slightly .
Thus , trained people have better tolerance of stressful situations .
Food that we consume is next issue of a healthy lifestyle .
Healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , and unprocessed food with proper amount of calories .
Our daily food should include enough protein , carbohydrates , fat , minerals , and vitamins which are required for normal body functions .
For instance , luck of protein causes muscles weakness ; luck of the vitamin A causes myopia and evening blindness .
Also , if food is not fresh or prepared not properly , it can consist bacteria or parasites .
For example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastro - intestinal track dysfunctions , and not properly thermal processing seafood can cause leptospirosis .
Moreover , fast - food should not to be on the table .
Avoiding eating fast - food products , we diminish a risk factor for getting some serious disease , such a cancer .
French fries are only one example .
Fries are usually cooked in a large amount of oil which boils during the all day .
According to sience In addition , we have to limit a size of portions and consume only amount of calories according to our individual needs .
In this way we will never have problems with obesity .
Being Healthy is fun !
You may think being unhealthy is only being fat but that 's not true .
Being unhealthy leads to multiple diseases such as heart or breathing problems and even depression .
Besides this being very awfull , staying healthy is a good way to feel good with yourself , find new interests and new frieds .
Here are some suggestions for you who wants to be healthy :
• Instead of going to a fast food chain in your lunchtime why do n't you try to go to our cafeteria in the campus which has a whole variety of salads and soups that are not only healthy but also really tasty ?
• Did you know that our atheletics team is accepting registrations ?
This could be a great way to find new teammates that would help you develop some skills .
Do n't waste time , run to go get the last spots .
• Right outside our campus you can find a gym that offers a lot of activities such as spinning , aerobics or even swimming lessons .
Also , because you are study in this college they will give you a big discount !
• Are you what is called a couch potato ? Get up of the couch , hang up the TV and go to the park in the campus .
There you can breath some fresh air while you read a book , play frisbee or defend your point of view with other students .
Traveling by car has become more and more popular nowadays .
However , the public transport will still survive .
First of all , the public transport like buses , subways are much cheaper and less resource consuming than cars .
The public transport can provide a affordable option for those who can not afford buying fancy cars .
It 's also more convenient to travel by public transport like airplanes for a long distance since traveling by car for a long distance can be really exhausted and inconvenient .
Last but not the least , public transport is more environment friendly than cars , which means public transport will be playing an even more important role when the environment problem becomes more and more severe .
If I could dream about an imaginary transport the machine would be long , wide and white .
I must be laying inside it to travel and the most important thing is that I 'll fall completely sleep in a few seconds .
I will be awake again when I arrive until my destiny : The Spanish Golden Century .
There the dramaturge Lope de Vega will be waiting for me to show me how plays take places in that period of time when the teathre it was the best entertaiment and the buildings were great .
Maybe , I 'll act like I did in the past .
Now I 'm going to write a movie review .
The name of the film is Bangalore days .
It is a film by Anjali Menon who directed the film Ustaad hotel earlier .
It is a tale of three childhood friends from Kerala .
Kuttan , Kunju(Diviya ) and Arjun .
They are typical small town young dreaming the big city Bangalore .
Kuttan himself narrate the story .
He starts with a punch line when they are in Kerala they do n't like it but when they are out of Kerala they missed it so much .
At the beginning of the story Kuttan get a job in Bangalore besides Divya completed her BBA from a local college .
She is planning to go to a bigger city for MBA .
At that moment an astrologer recommend Divya to marry soon .
So a arrange marriage happen .
Her husband 's name is Das .
When das first meet Divya he told that he had a serious relationship and he do n't think he is over it .
But it did not hamper the marriage .
From the first night divya of the marriage Divya found something is very wrong when das put off all his wedding clothes and come up with sleeping gown with a laptop in addition said that he has some office work to do .
When they go to their apartment in Bangalore showing a room das said that the room remains locked with old stuffs hence they can use other rooms .
Das keep himself busy with office work all the time besides he is showing an attitude that he has no time for others .
Though Divya and he is a married couple but he never shown any interest in Divya .
At the beginning divya always try to match with das but she could not .
So she is losing patience and grows a damn care attitude .
Das never feels for Divya .
So she keeps herself busy with her friends .
Meanwhile , Arjun come to the city . As he is a motor cycle expert , he found racing club named storm riders and starts work as a motor mechanic .
He can ride motor bike exceptionally well henceforward he won a race with the club owner .
Later the club owner banned him for one year .
But the coach of the club keeps an eye on him .
meanwhile Arjun falls in love with an rj named sarah who is disable .
The relationship faces many odds .
Sarahs mother do n't approve the relation .
They wants to go Australia .
The relation between Divya and Das are getting worsen .
At this time , after a quarrel divya opened the locked room and found that room is keepsake of das 's past relationship .
Now divya understand why their relation is not working .
Then she discussed it with her two best friend Arjun and Kutty .
This two become very angry .
Later Divya goes back to his parents ' home .
Her family blamed das and his family and want a divorce .
Kuttan , wants to marry a girl who must be a traditional Keralalian and has respect for Keralaian culture moreover the need to be beautiful .
At this point Kuttan made an urgent air trip to visit his sick father .
At the plane he met Meenakshi the flight attendants .
When Kuttan saw Meenakshi he thought the found his dream girl .
Latter they met in a mall suddenly at that time they exchange their phone numbers .
The relation began to grow .
Latter he found Meenakshi is not a traditional girl rather is a trickster .
It broke his heart .
Eventually he found Indian traditionalism in a foreign girl .
One day when the yearly racing event comes the coach tries to manage Arjun to attend the race .
At this time Arjun found out Das was the racing legend of the club .
Everybody respects and loves das .
He gets to know the story of das from others .
After a terrible accident Das 's girlfriend dies .
After that no one sees das . Arjun share the thing to his friends .
Divya immediately back to Bangalore and starts her mba .
Now the das and Divya are coming closer .
In the race Arjun becomes champions .
At the same day Sarah is leaving for Australia .
After the race das drive them to Sarah 's home to halt her .
Thus the story finished happily .
I love playing tennis .
I think it is one of the most complete sports in the world .
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old , my father taught me first and then I had one of the best teachers of the country .
I was a great player , I won several tournaments and I had a lot of fans .
My game was based in resistance , I could play for hours , I had just one thing in my head , pass the ball no matter what .
My height was an important advantage too , I could reach all the balls from one corner to another .
When I talk with kids who want to start playing tennis , I always tell them , tennis is about constancy , it 's not easy , you ca n't watch a game on TV and try to play just like them in a couple of days , it does n't work that way .
You must train at least two hours per day , eat the proper food , no alcohol and sleep enough .
If you can do that , you are a future tennis champion .
Good luck .
Throughout my entire life , technological breakthroughs dazzled me .
In school , I was indulged passionately in my study trying to understand how electrical gadgets work .
On roads , I observed cars , wondering how they moved .
I enjoyed using technical devices and electrical gadgets even in bed .
However , when I was a teenager , my mother had to go through a surgical operation to remove part of her liver .
This type of surgery has a low mortality risk due to the likelihood of human error .
Although , the operation was successful and my mother was healthy again .
The doctor had to remove her ovaries during the surgery after he managed to accidentally cause a hemorrhage in them .
He made a human mistake and my mother barely survived her liver operation with the unannounced removal of her ovaries .
The overwhelming panic that I felt during her operation and the pain we went through as a family after her the surgery has changed the shape of my life forever .
Due to a human mistake , neither my life nor my mother 's life was ever the same again .
Ever since that day , I wanted to be an engineer to design a robotic system that can perform surgeries with high accuracy ; thus , eliminating the human error margin .
I studied mechatronics engineering with the hope that one day , with enough knowledge and willpower , I will be able to work and contribute to the field of engineering .
I am both hardworking and resilient .
Living in my city Aleppo , located in Syria , during the war has broadened my vision and expanded my horizons .
I want to contribute to the improvement of my country and fixing what the war has broken by providing inexpensive prosthesis for the injured victims of war .
Therefore , master studies would enable me to put a smile on a child 's face who might have lost his legs , but this does not necessarily mean he has lost his right to play and enjoy his childhood .
I believe in life - long learning and I am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general , and German , in particular .
After finishing my master 's program , I will be preparing for my Ph.D. Besides studying in academic settings , I will continue learning and improving my German language while getting around Germany in my free time to learn about its enticing and wonderful culture .
I believe that we , as humans , are all equal and we all have the same dreams and hopes .
Thus , I want to do my best to help every life on planet Earth to lead a healthy and a happy life .
Not just the present generation , but also the entire human race .
I think that after attaining enough knowledge in the technical field , I will be able to extend the life expectancy of the human race with robots and systems that can work hand in hand to ensure humans ' safety .
Whether by designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic or developing robots that can conduct surgeries with lower risk .
Finally , I have to say that I feel the urge to help every human being that I come across in my life regardless of their race , gender or ethnicity . I do think that we have inside us all the power to achieve our dreams in life ; we just need a strong motive and enough dedication .
The sky is the limit .
The computer has been a major , technological invention of great importance .
We are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at the push of a button , use programs and even play games with these masterpieces .
A person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure and generally , the machine is a super enhancement in our ever - expanding , business - orientated world .
With health experts , however , our marvellous machine provokes problems to our health which must not be ignored .
Apart from being a necessity to some , it makes the human being lazy to a certain extent and thus , allows us to use our brains even less and less .
It is true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks which our brains are completely indifferent to .
But we ofught to ask ourselves " What happens when the computer - orientated world collapses ?
" We would then have to use our brains .
It is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine which runs off electricity .
The brain must be exercised to allow for this possible clanger , if we are dis - connected from our precious computers .
We must educate ourselves more and our children especially , who are at the forefront of tomorrows technology .
Hello Jo .
In my opinion my country , Spain , is the better place to travel .
Here you can find a lot of wonderful cities and many places to visit .
I would like to recommend you two cities to visit .
Firstly you must visit Sevilla .

Dear Prime Editor , Recently , a significant number of local people have been arguing about building the recycling plant .
Like many others , I strongly believe it will involve several positive aspects to everyone .
In Fact , almost all the residents in our local area are inclined to believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide jobs which we need .
Also , our neighbourhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there is an unbearably enormous increase in the amount of garbage which we want to get rid of .
Another reason , protecting the environment have been very difficult to do , but by building the recycling plat it will be much easier to keep our environment well .
Recycling does not only save the environment but also save your money , as buying recycled items is a lot cheaper .
The government have a massive responsibility to enthuse people to recycle .
Finally , in my opinion building the recyling plant is a great idea .
Factually , it is beneficial to both humans and environment . yours faithfully , Banhi Mohamed

If ever there was a false statement it is ; " There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . "
Travelling by car with it 's carbon monoxide poisoning the atmosphere and creating global climate change .
It is killing the planet .
Our love of convenience will cause the end of our beautiful planet and so , of course , us as well .
In most large cities around the world now cars are actually inconvenient and most people rely on public transport to get around .
The Paris Metro , New York Subway and London Underground are all an integral part of these teaming cities .
In many cities there are not only massive traffic jams but there is no where to park your car once you get to your destination .
If there is to be a public they will need to use and enjoy public transpaortation .
The model does need some work however such as , smaller and more frequent buses during most of the day with the big buses only coming out during the rush hours .
The future is all about public transport with the private gas driven car a thing of the past .
IF we make it past this disaster we will be saying " What were we thinking ? " .
Television has become an important part of our daily life , and it has both advantages as well as disadvantages .
Nowadays television is not only a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid of education , it educational importance ca n't be underestimated as well .
It is becoming popular in schools , also it audio - visual quality makes education programmes more effective and interesting .
Hence schools are making use of its potential for importing education .
Most of the schools in the United States of America have television sets , a lesson in the classroom is often boring , that it does not appeal most of the students , so they do not attend it .
To create interest in lessons television is a good source .
In subjects like science and geography , there are many things which can be shown on television .
Hi , Nazanin !
Thank you for the postcard .
It was very nice of you .
How were your Easter holidays ?
My holidays were rather interesting , even extraordinary .
As you know , this year I had celebrated Easter in Germany , because the Eastervacations were very short .
So , I tried to celebrate Easter according to my ukrainian folklaws .
Traditionally in the morning we have Eastermess in the church , and then Easterbreakfast .
Before the mess you must prepare a basket , that contains traditional Easter food and bless it in this Eastermess .
It was not so easy to find all the foods ...
But , at least the Easter came .
The weather was amazing it was warm and sunny , in spite of the day before it was cold , windy and haily .
I and my two friends went to the railway station , because the mess took place in Erfurt .
It was funny to take the basket though the town , because it was windy and I had to carry the basket very attentive not to leave the napkin .
The mess had to start at 3 , but it started almost at 4 .
The mess lasted approximately 2 and a half hours and then we expected to get home fast , because we were rather hungry .
But it waited a little surprise for us ...
We made only a few steps , and suddenly it became hail .
In a few minutes it looked like it 's winter outdoors .
It was not so easy to get to the railway station , because it rained and hailed and we did n't had any umbrella at all .
So , we missed one train and had to wait for another near one hour .
We got home only near 8 , we were very hungry and at least we our Eastersupper .
We had spent the great time together .
The next day my friends came to me for a visit .
So it was really cool .
Hope my story was not too long . )
Have you already planned anything for the next weekend ?
We could go anywhere together .
I 'm waiting for your answer .
From : Mercè
To : Marta
Subject : Your family
Hi Marta ,
I 'm writing because I want to invite you and your family this summer to Menorca .
I think that you can come the first week of July .
You can stay in my home in the countryside .
When you went we can go to the beach in the morning and we can take a walk from Ciutadella in the evening . Do n't worry if you do n't want to spend a lot of money because we can lunch at dinner at home .
I 'm speaking with my daughter .
She is very happy because she wants to pay tennis with your son .
Hope to see from you soon !
Mercè
We are suffering a great economic crisis in Spain .
There is a high inflation and a large underground economy , as a result , the education system of our country takes place among the poorest of Europe , together with the United States and the UK .
The economic crisis is affecting principally to education .
Politics is cutting back the aids to study .
There are more and more students that ca n't study because they receive a little economic help .
One solution to solve this problem is cutting down on the salary of people as footballers , politics , and commentators of trashy TV as Salvame .
Society is sure that if they do this , we , the students , will get enough money to study .
The authorities have been working really hard to find the way to take care of the environment in the community .
They have a program in that programme , the first rule is one day per month all neighbors go out to clean every street .
People have to separated the garbage organic or inorganic , if people do n't do it .
They have kept on the garbage on their house still they follow the rules .
People aboard garbage truck , they do n't receive the garbage .
This line graph shows the number of visitors to a selection of some diffirenet museums and galleries in sharjah , overall the greatest number of vistors was in sharjah museum of islamic civilisation and the least number of vistors was for Maraya art centre .
The most noticeable aspect of data in sarjah art muesum that it start in1991 and increased slightly until 2001 then it rose sharply to reach a peak of approximatly 3.2 in 2006 , secondly if we look at Sharjah calligraphy museum and Sharjah archeology museum we can notice that both line started in the same year 1991 archeology museum started with a number of 0.3 then it remained steady until 2001 then it increased sharply and the calligraphy museum started with 1 million visitors and it decreased slightly to 1996 to reach 0.9 million number of visitors then it remained stable until 2006 then it dropped to 0.5 million
Nowadays public transport seems to be one of the most suitable choices for us to travel .
This may be regarded as a quite difficult problem to solve .
More and more families are now getting used to buying individual cars rather than using public transport .
On the one hand , for our daily lives , it is worth buying a car .
We can use it for a wide range of activities such as taking our children to school , going to our place of work , doing the shopping and of course , going on family vacations .
Prices might seem more expensive at first , but later on , cars tend to turn very affordable .
But on the other hand , the climate change is ahead of us , we must ensure that every single person contributes to making our environment a better place for future generations .
For instance , we have many examples to prove that the public transport itself is improving our environment .
London 's subway for example , carries more than one thousand people each day .
People barely use their cars in crowded cities , that is why public transport still has a unique role in our daily lives .
Furthermore , public transport is developing new enviromentally friendly engines that may provide better conditions and renewed air for our people .
Investing in this sort of transport is now becoming a traditional activity for those who have enough income to care about society .
To sum up , people will still be using public transport in the future , although new changes must be made looking forward to surviving .
fist of all , try to organize your sport and music time and try your best to do both .
if you 're convinced you can not do both of them , think in two things , first , in which activity yo will have a better future . and second , wich one of these activities do you like the most . in my opinion ,
i think sport will give you a lot of bennefits more than music , because you do waht you like and at teh same time excercise .
i really hope this helps you .
sincerely Hector
Many people believe that being famous is fantastic , everyone on the street wants to get a picture with you , you have many fans .
Being popular is cool because everyone knows you .
Another good thing about it is that you 're distinguishable .
In the other hand all the time you 're observed by cameras , paparazzi , fans , even you 're at home , on holiday with your family .
You ca n't even go shopping without being noticed .
And I 'm sure that next day your photo will be on the first page of daily news .
What 's more journalists just waiting for your mistake , inaccurate statement or compromising bahaviour .
Moreover especially politicians are exposed for being even attacked by brazen journalists who hunts for them .
In my opinion famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them .
Nowadays everyone wants to know how looks like private idol 's life so I think it 's very hard for famous people to save their own life for themelves .
nowadays everything in the world are very develop such as education , transport , people 's life and so on .
I 'm sure that in the future these will more develop .
in the future , education will grow a lot , I think it will change about how to teach and what to learn .
scientists will create a pen can write in space , with this pen , teachers do n't want to go to the place has board but also write when they want everywhere . and a device which help students ca n't go to school can include the lesson and by this device , they can discuss with their friends in comfortable way .
about the transport in the next 50 years , cars use the sun 's energy will popular , and cars make environment become pollution will be gone away .
amount of people walk to school or the place where they work will increase .
this is a good change .
people 's life will change , too . in this time , maybe each family will have a robot which do housework .
people do n't want to spend a lot of time for house work and instead , they can relax after the work or do some difference activities .
people 's life style will be more comfortable .
I reflect there are many changes in the future .
All about me
Hello , I 'm Ailsa Dael Lam and I 'm thirteen years old .
I was born in the Netherlands in a town called Utrecht .
It is a nice town in the center of the Netherlands .
Some people think I was born in Holland , but that is not right .
I was born in the Netherlands .
Holland is a place in the west of the Netherlands .
Amsterdam , the capital of the country is there too .
About two years before I was born , my sister Jette came to the world .
She is now fifteen years old .
I have also a father called Geurt , it is a Dutch name which is hard to say for Swedish people , and a mother called Willemien .
We always had animals in our family .
Fred was the first cat I ever had .
He was always in my bed when I was a baby .
He had a special voice .
It was loud and everyone knew who he was because of it .
But now he is dead .
He died when he was eighteen years old .
Today we have a dog , Silas and two other cats called Selma en Romeo .
When Selma was one years old she got five kittens .
One of them was Romeo .
Today they are not so nice to each other as when they were smaller .
I moved to Sweden for ten years ago .
We moved because of the nature and because we wanted adventure .
In the Netherlands there is n't so much nature .
When we moved to Sweden I felt how the air was cleaner .
We rented a house near the water .
After a few years we moved to the house where we still live today on Edsviksvägen 118 in Danderyd .
We did n't move so far , but to a bigger and much nicer house .
Every Wednesday before I am going to my dance class I go to the Dutch school .
There I learn things about the Dutch grammatica so that I 'm on the same level as the Dutch children in my age .
If I want to , I can study in the Netherlands because of this .
I like to dance and to play field hockey .
I play field hockey on Sundays and I dance on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
Most Swedes do n't know what field hockey is , but it is a sport much like bandy , the difference is that the stick is n't the same .
I feel happy and free when I play hockey and dance .
I like to sport but I definitely like animals too .
Last summer I was in Spain with my cousins , it was the best holiday ever .
We lived on a camping near the sea .
There I made my first scuba dive .
It was so funny .
When I slowly sank down into the water I heard the sound of the bubbles .
I saw three red sea stars and many fishes .
I would really want to dive in Australia some day .
I also swam a lot with my cousins .
One of my favorite memories is when Selma got five kittens .
It was so nice to play with them and they were so cute .
She got them one night in May. I heard a sound of a cat and woke up .
When I looked to my left side I saw Selma in a basket , but she was n't alone .
There were a few other kittens in the basket !
I called them Romeo , Rebecka , Suchi , Ronja and Viggo .
All of them were white with black spots except one , Ronja , she was black with a white stomach .
My favorite restaurant is Bonbon in Stockholm .
There they have small dishes with fish , meat or vegetables .
When you want one of the small dishes they put a small ball in a glass .
When you have to pay they look how many balls there are in the glass and then they count how many you have to pay .
It 's very nice there and you do n't have to choose one dish , you can eat more smaller dishes .
I also like Italian food in restaurants like Ciao Ciao Duo in Stockholm .
When I 'm a grown up I want to be a veterinary .
That 's because I love animals and I want to help them when they are sick .
I think many veterinarians ask too much money for something that you can do at home too .
I do n't want to be like that and I want to start my own animal hospital .
My favorite color is blue .
It 's not just one sort of blue , but all sorts of it .
I also like pink .
I have much more favorite books then colors .
I like the Hunger Games really much , but I also like books of John Boyne like The boy in the striped pyjamas .
I also like the book this is Malala and The kite runner of Khaled Hossain .
I like to read books about war and the Taliban , because I think it is interesting and exciting .
This stories are often very sadly to , and I like to read that sort of stories .
That was a little about myself .
Thank you for listening .

The recent developments in the field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century , starting with the discovery of DNA and the mapping and understanding of it 's structure .
The manipulation of genes is an increadibly important and dangerously powerful ability which can not be left simply to the scientists to look after .
We are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering be it for medical reason or commercial ones .
Tomatoes are designed and engineered to last longer , apples to grow bigger , crops to ripen late to allow for transport time , pigs used to grow insulin for human use ...
the list is enormous .
Along with the many advantages there are dangers .
New biological weapons are being developed all over the world , eg the ability to transfer the genes which cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold , could , without much doubt , wipe out a significant percentage of the human race .
There need not be a war for something disastrous like this to occur , these genetically engineered microbes could be released accidentally whilst being investigated in an unsealed laboratory .
If we are going to accept the advantages which come with genetic engineering we have also to take responsibility for the disadvantages , the stakes are too high to leave this job to the scientists and they ca n't be expected to take the moral responsiblity for people who misuse the discoveries / inventions thereby causing disaster .
Governments should insure that money is invested not only in the research of genetic engineering , but also in insuring that the results of this research are kept safe .
I recommend visiting a Guido mine .
It 's an old mine , which was changed into a culture zone in our city .
Of course , it 's still a mine , so you can see all the mainor equipment used - Zabrze is located in Silesia , the area of coal mine .
It was set in 1855 by Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck , so the mine was named .
It has such rich history , so that I ca n't just tell you everything in one e - mail .
I can say only that , the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 320 .
The first one , level 170 , presents methods of mining , work of miners in late 19th century and history of that industry in Silesia .
This level is made up as interactive form of sightseeing supported by lights and sounds .
The main assumption is to shock visitor and make him feelings and , in my opinion , it surely does .
The visitors may be surprised by noise of crackling celing or rats ' squeling .
There are also many exhibitions organised during all year round .
High - qualificated guide is waiting for every group of visitors and he 's ready for even the most serious avalanche of questions .
On the path of sightseeing you can also find a chapel - place which is very important for every minor and , of course , place where the important celebrations take place .
On the level 320 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a longwall coal - cutting machine while it 's working .
You can also touch real coal with your hands .
There are organised many concerts , exhibitions and theatre plays too .
And if you get hungry - you can try something regional - you may be sure , that cooks do n't let you starve to death .
I think that the Guido mine is well worth visiting .

Nowadays , the aeroplane is treated as an ordinary aspect of our life .
Its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another .
However , a few decades ago we had a very limited notion of such a technology .
Yet , in the present , so ubiquitous it is that we seem not to take notice of air business .
If one were to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , they would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .
We tend to underrate the importance of the Aeroplane .
It is clearly obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conceive the world .
Firstly , as a result of its development we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism .
People have ample opportunities to set off on a riveting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .
Besides , the great influence of the Aeroplane may be seen in mass emigration .
Had it not been for Wright brothers emigrants and casualties would not be able to settle in remote lands , hence the world would teeter financially .
As far as vast changes which the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society 's attitude has also improved .
In the first place , throughout decades we had distant relation with such initially fallible a workhorse .
A classic illustration of this could be the use of air machines only for martial purposes .
Since the 20th century was about wars , we would only kill and exterminate people .
Additionally , creating such a vehicle was our morbid fascination since the time immemorial .
Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalised .
Air travel has converted from luxury at the rich 's disposal to a common thing available for almost everyone .
I personally believe that the influence , which the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , yet we have to bear in mind dangers connected with it .
For instance , at the beginning of 21st century tourists have been under the constant threat of terrorists .
Moreover , the opportunities which air technology brings may easily contribute to further development .
Perhaps , it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London would be in the twinkling of an eye .
To sum up , air business and its changes have been important for the world .
Apart from minute drawbacks , we can only laud its benefits .
It has certainly had and edifying effect on our thinking of travelling .
Many years ago , people lived without all things we have nowadays , it is , mobile phones , LED TV 's , computers , etc .
This means that we have experimented an important change with the passing of time , it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people 's life change .
Now , will we continue developing our technology and our life ?
From my point of view , technology will continue changing our life in aspects of routine , free time , up to the point that we will not be able to live without using them .
It is a problem , we must not depend on items like phones , TV , and all items created by technology .
If we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency about technology , we would not able to life in this way , I am sure of it .
Nonetheless , I think that people 's life will improve thanks to the technology , not only is referring to bad things like the dependency of technology , it offers us interesting things like new technologies , new informatics systems in order to improve the world of job , the improvement in a wide range of job sectors , agriculture , healthy system , etc .
Finally , in order to sum up , I think that people 's life will change , but not dramatically , it depends on each person and the way in which people focus their lives .
Unfortunately I haven't seen any trillers for ages .
I prefer other genres .
I saw a really great comedy by Wes Anderson last month .
It 's title is The Hotel Grand Budapest .
The story took place in Eastern Europe between the two world wars .
The hotel manager used to take care about his regular clients , especially old ladies .
The hotel florished and the manager felt himself and behaved like a God in his small universe .
He hired the teenaged Indian refugee as a bellboy and taught him all his skills .
He gave the boy a lot of lessons of hospitality , friendship , corrage and humanity .
An old man came back to the place of his youth and told the story about his friend and master .
Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there are other solutions like the platform of internet that is about sharing the car for a relative low price with people that is going to go to the same destination .
Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money but also it is more comfortable than travel with a lot of people .
First of all , public transport have less combinations ; it is too difficult to travel for example , if you had to work at nocturne hours and in special days it is impossible to catch a seat .
On the other hand , if you have lost the bus , train or any other public transport , you had to wait a long time between them and it results maddering .
In conclusion , people prefer travelling by car because it is more comfortable , you can go everywhere you want at the hour you consider the best and choose to share the space with other people or not .
Nowadays people spend lots of money in order to go to an English speaking country to improve their language skills .
But is it really the most effective way of learning a language ?
From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks .
Firstly , this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high .
Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .
What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation .
It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it speaking with native speakers .
However , I doubt that we will have lots of opportunities to speak abroad as we do not know many people there .
It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England .
I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules better .
To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .
I think that we should travel abroad so as to practise a language but not to study it .
