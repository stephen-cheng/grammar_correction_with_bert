S In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .
