A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To the Italian education authorities
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this report , I will describe the school system in my country , point out its flaws and conclude giving suggestions about how they could be addressed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The current situation
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .

A 24 24|||M:PUNCT|||-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theory .

S Suggestions
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .

S Furthermore , schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years , which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would , but it would also attract more people to the school itself .

S Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
A 14 15|||R:VERB:SVA|||makes|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
