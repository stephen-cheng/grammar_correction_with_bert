I like swimming because it is a sport that makes me work all my body and it is also a really complete sport. Nowadays it is really important to know how to swim because when we are in holidays we spend most of our time in the water at the swimming pool or even at the sea. I like other sports such as football and volleyball too.\nI would give the advice that this sport makes people healthy but it also help us to make new friends because while we are training we have mates in our team which we can talk to and make them our friends. Otherwise it is a sport where you do not have contact with your friends what helps not to make injuries.\nTo conclude, I think this is a really good sport to start with when we are a little child to gain experience and year after year becoming better and improving."}

What's more, I didn't have to pay for the ticket, because it was a volunteer work - closing the door after people that were coming out of the concert hall. The good thing about it was the fact, that the band(actually I even don't remember it's name)was playing with so much passion, that no one probably even think about leaving the place. In a word, doing nothing was the big advantage of this kind of work.  There were many things that just stunned me in one moment, when the band started to play... First of all, Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard. In my opinion music like this should be diplayed more often in the radio and other mass media. The bad thing about it is that the band is not popular, and not many people have ever heard about it. Mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music, probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music.\nSee you soon!\n\nTake care,\nJim"}

Walter Mitty is acted by an excellent Ben Stiller, now arrived at the top of his career as actor. \nFar from the noisy and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street, Walter Mitty offers to the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character's life and adventures, through which he will discover his true self and will restart a new life. \nAlthough presenting a more vivacious plot, The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does. \nI must say that The secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well-constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie.\n"}

People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car.It is true in many cases as public transport like buses,trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops.This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination. Secondly, public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them.\nIn modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy,which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover,many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car.\nIn conclusion,i would say that due to recent advancements in society,there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership.It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future."}

I advise the parents to let the children begin swimming as soon as they can, provided they are interested in it. It is not worth saying each one  should follow their passions.

I have been teaching English for 5 years already and I would dare to say that this job was made for me. \n\nIn terms of my personality, I am very hardworking, enthusiastic to wide range of activities, open and friendly. My opinion is rooted in my experience so I really enjoy interacting with people, especially children, and to tell you the truth I like cooking and experience new things in general. I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this posistion. My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail.\n\n\nI welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you.\nSincerely, \nMary J."}

A wise man in the past said once, \"If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climer, the strength of a shot putter, the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer.\" Badminton is my favourite sport art. I feel happy after every game. It's exhausing and you have to move fast to get every birdy. You have to be competitiv! You can play it in every age. I started when I was seven years old in my first class. My coatch was very nice and mostly we played in teams. I had a lot of fun at the sommer sport camps and I met a lot of friends. With the badminton club in our city we traveled to different city's and countries. If you want to start playing badminton you should look for a badminton club near by and should sign up for a training class. If you don't know what racket you should buy, you will get all information at the club. Mostly the Badminton Clubs sell all kinds of Badminton equipment for beginners and professionals. Don't be lazy! When you start playing you should practice minium twice a week, better three times a week. Envide your friends from school or work. Practice together with people in your age is a lot of fun und you will get better soon. I play usually three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend. It was very exciting, because there were many people from all over the region. I lost a few games, but that's okay. Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won games makes me proude and smile for all the hard work that I have done in the last few mounth. In our Badminton Club we have a lot of members over the age of sixty years old. I hope I can still play when I get to that age. The sport keeps you healthy and fit. "}

Particularly in Barcelona, the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there wasn't an aproppiate place to keep it so they couldn't eat one or two days later.\n\nThat situation must have been terrible for the population but fortunately, there is always a possible solution. A group of fishers began to walk around the city looking for a good place where they would have brought their fish. Finally, they found an old destroyed palace and they decided to build there their own \"fish's shopping centre\". Neighbours helped them to make the building and after a few months, they began to use it. \n\nThis is a great example of how Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government's help.\n\nNowadays, the building has been become a luxury mall with the most expensive brand clothes. However, the structure has been kept in order to visitors can enjoy this popular architecture's jewel. "}

He was dreaming it was his time to go fishing; he went so far that he saw a kind of battle between sharks and whales. He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle wasn't really a battle it was a revolution, were the fish where the citizens. Which meant some of fish were damaged thanks to the revolution, which also meant that while they were reproducing, the genes of the baby were changed. And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish, they will taste different or simply change its form. If there were a revolution in the city, obviously the fish would try to escape. The fish where going to the beach were, the people fished. That was his entire dream, he was now scared to know if that was real or not. But it was too illogical to be true; the good thing was that he wasn't the one that would go and fish, which will be the leader. After a few days of waking and only eating fish, they continued having the same allergic reaction to the fish thanks to their nutrition. \nThe homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food. They will notice quickly because fish will smell worse than it already did. When he woke up from his dream kind of having a skeptic attitude, but he was diminishing it. After walking for a lot of days, the 'survivors' were worried, and thinking of how much they would still need to walk to find a city, also they were thinking that maybe they were going forward one day and backwards the next day.

It has many advantages and disadvantages as well.\n\nOn the one hand, there are a large amount of teenagers who have no idea for their future. They don't know which university and field of studying choose. During a gap year you have the chance to consider all the issues connected with your future. You have enough time to try to use your capabilities and at the same time discover your own calling. Besides, there are a great number of people who graduated school but don't have enough money to continue their education. The year off gives the apportunities to get a job. In the beginning it would be a simply and without high wages job but you would get some experience. What's more, you can use this time to travel and relax. You can get to know other countires and new individuals. \n\nOn the other hand, I can see also negative aspects of taking a year off. You start your study later comparatively with your friends. It would be more difficult to start your own life by oneself. It is also a point that when you don't execute what you wanted to during a gap year, you are in the same place when you were graduating school.\n\nTo sum up, I think that taking a year off is an important decision you should give it a thought before you finally decide."}

This new way of teaching pupils has received a mix response.\n\nFirstly, being at schools with lots of other children in a class develops your social skills, but learning at home, makes you lose contact with others. When you do the lessons, you have nobody to chat to it about.\n\nAlso, staying regularly on the computer is a way to get glasses. Electronics are bad for our eye. Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC. Let's see.... 6 and a quarter hours of school plus an extra 30 minutes for homework.....that is 6 and three quarters hours on the computer. That is more than a quarter of the time in a day! It'll be even more if the student plays games or does something else on the PC.\n\nPenultimate, there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project. Travelling to school at least includes 1 meter of walking ,nevertheless staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and health. Schools provide you with healthy food despite the fact we'll just eat anything we want at home. \n\nFinally, I personally disagree with cyberschol. It's unhealthy and dangerous.

There are only limited numbers of government buses on the road and their frequency are not good so they get overcrowded.

The waiting time is minimum, you get a train in every 3 to 5 minutes. The fare of the metro train is almost equal to the other transport means. The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas. After a few kilometer, you will find a bus stop but Metro stations are built only in major areas. So even if you travel through metro, you have to take a bus or auto to reach your destination unless it is located near a metro station.\n\nPeople who are rich prefer to travel by their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience. In public transport many people don't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey, it is very exhausting especially in a long journey. While in a private vehicle you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey. If we take out the cost factor, there is not a single reason for anyone to travel through public transport.\n\nMany crimes such as pickpocketing, eve teasing, violence, etc  take place in public transport. It has been an easy target of terrorists to plant bombs, so if you are traveling through a bus, you accept the risk. Everyone cannot afford a car so public transport would be there but in future as well but  fewer people will use it."}

Generally, young people don't have any problem in posting their personal photos on the Internet. They also publish their conversations on the internet.

Firstly, each teacher would be able to teach courses according to their own expertise, which leading to a more advanced and high-quality teaching. Secondly, teacher can select subjects that are more useful for local culture. However, what students learned might be biased to certain aspects. And it will be difficult for examining students' ability in a national scale. Moreover, not all teachers have the ability to design a high-quality course map.\nIf the decision is made by central authorities, the most obvious advantage is that the estimation for students' grades could be standardized in the whole country.

At the beginning, I had a flatmate who loved cycling and running, even in a city like Madrid. Therefore, we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths than pavement. Later, I have had more roommates, colleagues and partners even who practised this sport, which is among the most fashionable ones at this moment. Moreover, the races are masser and masser and more and more popular. But, for the beginners, I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence, and practising with company because running may be bored, tired, dangerous, even, but if you get a strong spirit and will power, you'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses."}

Also you are able to choose a place to go depend on how you feel.

We usually meet three times a year all together to eat a pizza in the city center.

But there are some disadvantages like stairs because we are at the second floor. We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many strairs to reach our classroom and that's so annoying sometimes.

Firstly, they allow us to travel fast by road, mostly to the exact place we want to go. Furthermore, travelling by car is a very comfortable way of transport. For instance we can use cars radio to listen to some relaxing music, or listen to news while making our way to the place we want to go.\n\n As you may be concerned, cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages. Nowadays people are depending on them too much. Cars are being used even when not necessary. In addition, cars have been increasing the world carbon emission and that causes the 'Ozone Layer' to thin down. Finally, for our car to work, we need to fill them with fuel, which is expensive.\n\n To sum up, cars have advantages but, on the other hand, they can also create problems.

They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances, sharing out the stolen money with their audiences.\n\nAs far as the storyline is concerned I have to say that the film is really fast-moving.

It is fairly well played by actors,such as, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman who play their role perfectly, making the film light-hearted.

The study guide doesn't need to necessarily be a long and complex one (since those may cause them stress too); they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises. Another simple solution I think could help is to study as well as to review content during sessions before a certain exam, to help the students study whilst still having a class. The previous are the best possible solutions I would address in order to stop once and for all the problem of stress thanks to exams, in which most of the cases, as the previous paragraph explained, leads to many more.\n"}

They are short sighted and seems that they are brain-washed by radical democracy thoughts.\n\nPeople who signed in the website were colluding foreign powers to suppress our own country, China. I think this is traitors' action. They do not have basic loyalty to their own country. Using foreign powers to threaten China is a kind of unwise act. Hong Kongers, being a Chinese, should not inhibit our own country, with other countries. In fact, china will not be moved by this, and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong, China and the US.\n\nChina has the power and freedom to decide the way to settle the dispute. The US and other countries should not disrupt it. It is better not to interfere the internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China's politic conditions. The US is really a busybody.\n\nAs we all know, Occupying Central is illegal. The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly. The US always keep \"rule by law\" as their catchphrase, but Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kong law. So it is very strange for US to say \"rule by law\" when they support Occupying Central.\n\nIn Occupying the Wall Street, the US did not seems to be much more peaceful than Tiananmen Massacre. According to Wiki encyclopedia, FBI called the occupier as \"terrorist\" and decided to suppress the dispute as settling terrorist attack. So the US has no qualification to criticize China. Apart from this, the president election in the US is full of unfairness. I do not know if there is filter for president candidates, I just know that the ballots are counted in states. There are different number of residents in different states, but it uses the states to represent the residents. I do not think the election is fair enough for the US to ask for \"real democracy\" for Hong Kong.\n\nIs the US really target to get Hong Kong into a democracy area? I think not, but a democracy \"country\". After Hong Kong gets \"real democracy\", the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent. The US always target on dividing China into many small, weak countries, then it can break up a competitor of itself. And it can even occupy the broken China to get interest in it.\n\nLet us see counties that the US introduced \"democracy\" to it. Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, there were chaos for \"democracy\" everywhere, and the next, might be Hong Kong. I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to chaos that similar to Tunisian Revolution.\n\nThe signature collection of the White House now ended. China has not take any further action. \n\nI really hope Hong Kongers that signed in the website could think again what they were doing and how harmful it is to China. And I really think the US could stop picking on China."}

Some people think that knowing fact  is more easily and practicable. Nevertheless, others consider learning  ideas and concept is the best way to  confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l   completely  agree with the idea that it is important to  students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons.\n \n        First, learning facts  can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n\u2019t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained  in class, but just remember facts.   When I do my homework, I find  the problem is different than the case   discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and  try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember  facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can  solve many kinds of problem  simply.\n\n   Second,  learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.  .  Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in  a certain subject. When, students  catch  the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance,  when I  was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points.\n\nIn sum,  absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do   student learn more in  their studying, but also they help students  understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways.       \n"}

You could spend some time walking and visiting the region. There are good meals and drinks: \"fabada\" (with beans) and \"sidra\" (it looks apple juice). Near the mountain (about 20 kilometres) you can find beaches, but I recommend the beaches on the South, Andalusia. There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time. If you come here on February, you will enjoy a lot in Cadiz with the carnival. If you come on Spring, you have to visit Seville, and you will enjoy the Easter Week and the Feria week.\n\nTravelling in Spain is easy. You have many roads, motorways, so you can rent a car and travel by yourself, without table-fixed times. Despite, if you dislike driving, you can use public transport: long distance trains, buses, etc. \n\nAt the end, to look for a job, I think the best option is Madrid, which is the capital city, and there you will find a job easily. \n\nI hope you enjoy your travel and see you soon.\n\nPaco"}

When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment (with talented but selfish players who aren't committed to their \"team play\") he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches.\nSometimes, the real spectacle doesn't take place in the fields, but in its surrounds! Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate.

But in the  17th century there happened a miracle. Polish people had to defend Cz\u0119stochowa and rescue their countryBut the polish resistance was smaller and smaller . Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill. Polish soldiers managed to repulse them. In 1656 polish king John II Casmir made Lw\u00f3w Oath. He promised that the Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa will always be a polish queen. I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country.

It doesn't matter that they have failed or gained success on those events, the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events.In this point of view, children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences.I myself, have faced with so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents.Once I was 18 years old, I had to make an important decision about my university major. So I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities.I was hoping that, my decision was the right one, but it wasn't actually.I had chosen electronic but my parents told me to have some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronic.I did their recommendations and I totally changed my idea. There were some aspects that I was really unaware of them. So by considering different ideas and opinions, finally I chose computer engineering as my university major. Now I am graduated in this major and I am really satisfied with that. So, Parents' experiences can make them strong teachers for their children.\nParents' closeness to their children can be another reason that makes them good teachers. They are really close to their children in the terms of feelings and emotional matters. They have a strong familiarity about favorites, skills, talents and all other valuable information related to their children.Regarding this information, they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions. I remember once in high school I had to make new friends and I was dubious about my situation and it was a great dilemma to choose the best ones. So I came to my parents and asked their help, they presented the best recommendations for making the decision, then I could make the best friends that I can easily go along with.I am really satisfied by my parents as my indisputable teachers. they have really saved my lives in different cases.So parents can be the best teachers regarding their emotional closeness to their children.\nAll in all, parents are a great source of experience, which can help them to be good teachers. Also they have so many close relationships with their children, which makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers. I hope a day that all the children rely on their parents as their teachers."}

It is efficient and private. Car manufactures desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of a car. By making it more modern, powerful and economic, they have successfully attracted more customers than ever. In Canada, the vehicles per capita is 60.7% in 2001[1]. There was once an interest saying that North America are the nations on wheels. Car has brought the epic change to our lifestyle. We depend on cars so much as if they are our spare pair of foot. \n\n       As result, the rapid increasing of cars on the road brought negative consequences. Firstly, vehicle's emissions can cause detrimental effects on the environment in many ways. Such as global warming, soil and water pollution and acid rain. Secondly, vehicles contain many different fluids, including motor oil, antifreeze, gasoline, air-conditioning refrigerants, and brake, transmission, hydraulic and windshield-wiper fluids. In most cases, these fluids are toxic to humans and animals, and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed incorrectly. \n\n        In addition, traffic congestion has become another worsen problem. It spread massively in much of the world and has many negative impacts of all aspects. In 2010, a recurring massive traffic jam that happened in China caught worldwide media's attention. The traffic Jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days. Many drivers were able to move their vehicles only 1 km per day, and some drivers reported being stuck in the traffic jam for five days. It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media.\n     \n        On the other hand, modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade. Its comfortable, efficient and economic features have been attracting more young professional. By taking a subway, you will be able to guarantee your arrival time for a class or an important meeting;  In some big cities, public transport plays a big role in a modern society. with great coverages and efficient routes, subway has become the most popular commute tool. For instance, in New York, the subway system contains 232 miles of routes. In 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2]   Shanghai Metro system are 14 metro lines and 329 stations, with an operating route length of 334 miles, with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013. On a normal weekday over 8 million people use the Shanghai Metro.[3]\n\n        In addition to the convenience of public transport, the fare is much cheaper compare of driving a car. Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport pass as a benefit.\n\n          The public transport in my city is very convenient. Even though our subway system is still developing, the main line that pass through downtown, several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourist, students and professionals's prior choice for commute.  There are some park and ride stations allowed car drivers to connect with the subway, It is very convenient and encouraged more people to drive less. If I have to get to somewhere on time in rush hour, I will first consider the subway over drive a car. \n\n\n          Eco-friendly awareness has positively affected young generations. Taking subway to work has become a trend and all the changes that happening today will sure lead a bright future to public transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Wikipedia, Motor Vehicles Per Capita\n\n[2] Wikipedia, New York City Subway\n\n[3] Wikipedia, Shanghai Metro System "}

What to you feel are the main causes of this? What are the effects?\n\nObesity is one of the most important challenges of the current society due to the fact that people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly. This essay will look at the some of the key causes and effects of overweight among people.\n\nFirstly, food habits such as fast food and sedentary lifestyle are some of the main causes of surge in weight among people. For instance, there are many studies by various bodies in the US show that more and more teenagers are spending most of their time in front of TV or computer playing video games, they hardly perform any sort of physical activity and also indulge in fast food. This shows that fried or package food and complete lack of exercise are the chief reasons for increase in obesity among young people.\n\nSecondly, bullying among teenagers and rise in heart attacks are some of the main effects among people who are obese. For example, it should be noted that, recent studies by WHO has revealed that obese people are prone to bullying and there is rise in number of cases of heart attacks among young people with obesity. This example shows that people with obesity not only suffer from bullying but also from heart attacks.\n\nHaving looked at both causes and effects of overweight among people, it is recommended that people take care of eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a health lifestyle for their own benefit."}

Due to the enormous economic crisis that have shaken Europe and that have intoxicated the real-estate market, most of the prices are eye-watering expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate. Even if they manage to save the amount of money for a flat it usually has not enough room to swing a cat. In addition the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account. \nIf you cannot afford it, then just rent it.\nAlthough renting is the first option for most of the youth, rents also had been affected for the housing bubble and their prices have shot up too. Then, sharing the costs could be the solution for lots of students beyond all the problems that could arise from the communal living. \nAt least you\u2019ll always have your parents.\nIn order to save up for future plans, a large number of early adults prefer to stay under the wing of parents rather than leaping in the dark and go out. That could be end in constant arguments because of issues like intimacy and so on.\nWhat about the future?\nThe future remains uncertain until the economic situation gets over. As there are no many signs for this to become real, young people must wait to start their own lives.\n"}

Owning vechicle is very comfortable and gives you independence. It enable you to go everywhere you want no matter when. You can also stop caring about how much you taking to work and on trips, being able to hide all those things inside of your trunk while it is impossible in any other means of transport,\nOn the other hand, having your own car is expensive and no everyone could afford it. For those people there is always another option - public transport. It is not only cheaper, but also saves you from such problems as lack of  parking places and reduce traffic jams.

Nowadays, we have a lot of electronic devices such as microwaves, remote contols for tv, electronic devices for cooking, personal computers, and so on and so forth. Each one make the everyday life a bit more easy, but a real progress on home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind. This would be my 'home of future'. An inner electronic system would compose the whole house; it would include small devices of wave reception connected, in every side of house, to a gum headband whose function would be to identify the neuronal stimuli and to convert them on radiowaves. This headband would be related to household chores such that if you would need to washing dishes or to sweeping, you only may to think about it and the robotized system of the house would send orders to each part of the house itself. This system would also be connected to the Internet in a 'dual output port remote of information'. \nHaving explained it, I am completely sure that this outline of my 'house of future' will astonish and marvel everyone who read my sublime project."}

I am glad to tell you that it was awesome and I hope that I will be able to do something like that again. I am convinced that it was one of the best days in my life.\nIt all started when I applied for being a volunteer at this event. I didn't think that I have any chance to get there, because of the big amount of rivals. But I fortunately did it. I attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing public about the programme and all the organisation stuff. There were so many guests and I was afraid that it will be too hard for me to do it right. But my new friends from this group were very polite and we worked together, so it was much easier, than I thought at first.\nAfter some time I felt sad, because I realised that I won't be albe to see the bend playing at the stage, because I had to stay in front of the entry. But after the first song, when the audience started to sing and dance, our manager came to us and told us that we can go see the concert. I was so extremely happy. I was having a great time through the entire concert. After that we went to the backstage and spent some time with the band. We took some pohotos and got autographs. It was really cool.\nAs you can see, it was all really amazing. I met a lot of fantastic people and I am still in touch with them. I hope that next time you will be able to go with me.\nLove, XY."}

When mobile phones have conquered our palms, we have no time to even meet our parents and children. Our interaction with human beings have pathetically reduced.

Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely, but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with our people. They are safer, cheaper and faster.

Maybe, most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on, despite not always it's true. I should talk in the third person because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but a close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them.\n\nOn the other hand, we can find arguments against this statement. For example, the debate about the statement that you cannot choose your family, but your friends. Thus, it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families. They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust. \n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, it's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family, like envy, refuse or hate. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it's almost obvious that they aren't going to spread it. Even, if you look for a good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But, family not always guarantees these functions neither friends.

We must come to library to pay a lot of time finding information we need on the shelves the earlier time. On the other hand, we can assess the information with only a click button nowadays. Clearly, the assessment become much more efficiently with computer and internet.\nYet, perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using internet is that the vast amount of information contended in it. All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click. Admittedly, some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough, it still offers us many other useful sources. Simultaneously, some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information.

The cathedral hasa height of 55 m. The Dom was rise at rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756.What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk.The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday, from ten o\u2019clock a.m to six p.m. And a phone number where you can call for more information is 0040212345678."}

Instead of it, imaginary road network will be built in our air space. \n\nFurthermore, environment will suffer the terrible effects of current lifestyle.

It is believed they are extraordinary, perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we see their in magazines and TV. Everybody longs to be a well-known and admired person leading rich and carefree life. Unfortunately, truly it isn't so amazing like it seems to be. There are a lot of disadvantages of being a star, of witch normal people don't realised for example not having a private life. There are a lot of various viewpoints and I would like to consider them. Famous people haven't got private life. Almost every their mystery come out and they are still judged, criticised or joked. Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the cost of them. Everybody makes mistakes, but their mistakes are wtitten and known by the society, what is unfair and harmful. They deserve to have a normal life, have mysteries, a moment of peace without interest around them. Being all the time in a centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming. It can lead to being touchy and gloomy. That is why a lot of big name suffer from depression or even try take their life. \nOn the other side, there is a price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this. They got so lot compared with unpopular people, that's why I think it would be unfair, if they have also private life. People can not have everything and live like they want. They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life, because there is plenty of people, who dream to be them. Famous people have to consider how many humans suffer from famine or work very hard to earn their living. They have not got expensive cars, detached houses, they can't afford travelling and their only entertainment is watching TV. They should remember they are lucky devils not like they often think-victim. \nTo sum up, It is hard to simply claim, that famous people deserve have a private life and being left alone by paparazzi or not. Everyone from time to time need a moment of peace to relaxed and recover their strength. However, nobody has everything they dreamed; it is normal, that always in our lives something would be annoy us. Famous people have to notice, how much they have, apprecciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life, because it is not such a disaster like they often think. "}

As a result, they offer low fee and play an important role in the environment protection. It was reported that for one hundred kilometers running, each car was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline, and released a certain proportion of air polutted. Meanwhile, with the same amount of energy, bus carried fifties of people, and even up to as high as hundreds of people with the massed transportation. \nSecondly, it could not be denied that travelling by car is convenient, however people who agreed with the idea point out that high quality and modern public transport such as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable. Trains or MRTs \ncan also satisfy passengers who could not travel by plane and require to take long haut jouneys. There are some places in developing countries, for example in remote or highland areas, people have not seen a car for many years, they have no choice except old buses to travel.\nIn conclusion, public transportation is still the first choice of people in the future."}

It's quite well known the benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community: an important reduction of contaminant gases, a hight decrease of acoustic contamination as well as, as consequence of having less cars circulating by our streets, an increase of pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking, running or cycling.

Besides, when the bamboos flowering and seeding they die, so until the new bamboos grow enough to be eaten by the pandas takes a long time and this fact forces the pandas to move to new places in order to look for food. Therefore, the risks of the extinction to the Giant Pandas are real."}

Thus, the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company.\nIn this programme, the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor. The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost, so the company is not required to pay him a salary. Furthermore, as the programme is endorsed by European Union, the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance. As for the duration, the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months, being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant.\nI will be completely available to do the internship from next September on. I can assure you that I will put all my effort into learning and making the most of my stay in your company. I hope you will consider my application, and look forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully,\nFabio\n\n"}

One may ask why among all those possible activities, this one was chosen. Of course I do not count running indoors, but only outdoors, while the breeze is blowing in one's face during the exercise. That is what I call a good activity. There is not exactly a good day for running, for even the rainy days are excellent for a good run. If one has a sunny and windy weather, it is nice because the sun warms one up and the wind helps keep it fresh. On the other hand, if it is rainy, the cold water cools it down and make one feel less tired during one's time.\nThis is my favorite sport for it improves health in some many ways and boost the resistance and quality of life. The first times may be hard, in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have. There can be some pain and almost everybody becomes really exhausted at the beginning. After the first trials, however, improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly: better breathing, uninterrupted and quiet sleep, and an unmistakable sense of well-being. It even helps reducing your belly!\nDespite being a common and easy to do activity, running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well. Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one's feet in a nice temperature. Notwithstanding, a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period. Go to a doctor, ask him to analyse the type of step to make up with an ideal footwear. This way, there will be less trouble when practising the exercise.\nI must say that, as a runner, I do not regret it at any time. Everybody can do, it is practical and simple, and the goals can be set in accord with the person's needs and restrictions. Do not hesitate to go out and try it out! Take that pair of snickers and go for it!"}

I have always preferred to relax during some series or soap opera, but after watching 'Flushed' I change my point of view. If you haven't seen it yet, after reading this short text you'll go to the cinema if you only have a chance. \nTHE BIRTH OF NEW STAR\nI guess that a name Ann Smith tells you nothing. And that's obvious because it's the first serious production of this young, prospective director, whose 'Flushed\" became a worldwide hit. It is said that a well-known cast enabled her to be highly granted for her piece, but I have some doubts about it.  \nTHE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS \nAnd that's why I find this move so excited. An enormous amount of additional attractions for viewer provided me with  unforgettable feelings. Everything came us a surprise and you didn't expect that this or that action is just taking place. The movie requires from us to be strongly concentrated on what is going on and I find it to be one of mostly conceiving factors for those who still have some objections. The director gives a choice to broaden our mind and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe imaginable ending of the gripping story.\nRECOMMENDATONS\nFor me there is no better movie to be presented in our club. Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers, under no cicumstances can we miss it!\n"}

My name is Ester, I was born in Danderyd and \nI have not moved since that.\nI have got one sister, she is 15 years old and her name is Tina, she is also going in Fribergaskolan. I also have a little rabbit which is named Frippe, he is so cute and cuddly. But my dream is to own a horse because I love riding. On \nFridays and Saturdays I go riding at the riding center \nnamed \u201cDjursholms ridskola\u201d  and at Sundays I often go \nto my \u201ccarer horse\u201d, it\u00b4s like your own horse for a day (or more) in the week and mine is Saturdays. My carer horse is named Wiggins but he\u00b4s called Viggo. Viggo is a black, quite small pony. He\u00b4s a little bit lazy but loves to run fast, so he is lazy in a smart way. I love him and I hope he loves me back.\n\nWhen I was eight years old I visited Thailand, it was wonderful and we lived at a hotel so close to the beach, I could nearly touch the sand from the pool. We rode on Asian elephants and dived in the water. One day we were out to three different Islands in a diving- group. One of the islands was a cave you had to swam into it, it was very beautiful.\nWhen we were in Thailand we saw many different animals, everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea-snakes.\n\nEvery year at the sport-vaccination me, my mom and my sister are going to Switzerland to go skiing in the alps, it\u00b4s wonderful and really fun. We have never seen a marmot but I so want to. We have went to Champ\u00e9ry a couple of times. In Champ\u00e9ry you can ski over to France, that is awesome. We have also went to Verbier, I loved the cabin we slept in there. It was very big but was cozy at the same time.\n\nThree words that describe me best is perhaps, animal lover, happy and a perfectionist ? It\u00b4s hard to say something like that about yourself. A weakness I would like to eliminate is that I often think or say \u201cI do that later\u201d and never doing it or say the same thing when it\u00b4s time to do that. That is really annoying for my mom and others.\n\nI like food, especially Italian food, It is my favorite food to eat. And of Italian food I like  pizza (thin with tuna) or  some delicious pasta the most. My favorite restaurant is \u201cLa Piazza\u201d in Djurholm and it is of course Italian, I have actually been in Italy twice, in Rome and Florence and in a small town named Lucignano in the countryside. I think that\u2019s my favorite country too. When we were there last summer, I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called Hoopoe. It was beautiful and had like a mohawk of orange feathers on its head.\n\nI like to read too, my favorite type of books is horse books or just  random books  its hard to explain but I mean, books with daily action not sciene-fiction or romantic. Some of the books I like is named only way is up and steal the show and is written by Emmy Abrahamson, I think she is a very well author, another author I like is John Boyne who has written the terrible thing that happened to Barnaby brocket. Right now I read a book called \u201cthe maze runner\u201d it is very exciting.\n\nWhen I grow up I want to be a vet, it\u00b4s a dream come true for me, I hope I will go to other countries like Australia and job there as a vet for a couple of years. I have never been blood scared or something like that and I would love to have a job I think is fun lifetime out.\nAnother dream job for me would be an art-director. I love to design presentations and edit things at the computer but also in real life like my room, clip-art and more."}

Basicaly, the method is based in develop the main foundations of moviment of the human body, they are: swim, run, walk, jump, quadruped moviment, climb, lift things, balance and defend yourself.\nRaimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army. He had a great background in gymnastics and, sice he was a teenage, he used to do a lot of exercises. The roots of Parkour was developed by him and he taught some of Parkour thechniques to the fireman which he used to work with. His son, David Belle, was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too. David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment and then the actual Parkour was born. Some people say that David criated Parkour but, in fact, his father develop all the idea of the discipline. David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves.\nParkour isn't just a physical discipline, there is also the philosofical part. Altruism, \"be strong to be useful\" (it is actually a frase Natural Method), develop your body and mind so that in a dangerous situation you will be able to save yourself and other people and so on. Therefore, is due to its philosofy and the joy that I fell before, during and after a train, this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise."}

We all wear clothes, do we? And most people think about what they wear, although some don't care about there clothing. What happens when we all just have to wear the same clothes? Do we really need fashion? I talked about this topic with a few other students and asked them what there opinion is. In the following paragraphs I'll tell you what they told me.\n\nThe first question we discussed was: 'Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufactures?' Their opinios first varied a bit here. An argument some called was:'In case we remove this whole industry, then there would be an humangous group of peoole unemployed, and that would be a problem.' The others answered on this with the question: 'When does a company starts making something, just because they want something to do?' This question made the other group doubt a bit, they did agree that a company doesn't just start making something to have something to do. This made them all agree that fashion is there for a reason, and not only for money.\n\nNext question we talked about the following question:'Does it have too much effect on models?' They didn't have to think about their opinion, they all directly said 'Yes'. They told that if you wanted to be a model, you had to fit in a size of clothing which is really small. There is immense group of girls who really want to be a model, caused by the fact that they don't fit in this clothing yet they have to lose weight. Much girls are losing too much weight right then because they want to be 'perfect' and got anorexia and those things.\n\nThe following question which we talked about was:'Does it have too much influence on young people?' Here they all directly responded with a 'yes' too. In their opinion young people, also themselves, were very busy with fashion and clothes. An example on which they all agreed was:'In case you just met your new class, and you had to choose next to who you had to sit the most people were going to sit next to the girl or boy with the trendy clothes'. Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing, just because they thought they would have more friends then.\n\nThe next question was:'Does it make society materialistic and competitive? The students were a bit doubting but agreed on the fact that people who have stylish clothes are usually the most popular. And there're a lot of people who want to be popular, so they are going to buy trendy clothing. \n\nThe last and probably the most difficult question we discussed was:'Does it affect the way you dress and the kinds of clothes you buy?' They all said it kind of did affect however they also bought clothes they liked. I asked them the question:'If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends didn't, would you then have bought it?' They all said yes, but with a little doubt. \n\nSo, we do kind of need fashion. But where do we decide on which clothes we wear? And do you have to like your clothes or someone else? Maybe we should keep in mind that we should wear clothes in which we feel okay.\n"}

The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors. A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities.\n\nATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES\nThere are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics. These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge, elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids. In addition,most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall.  \n\nSHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS\nAs a matter of fact, Shop-rite is one of the best place in my opinion, that I would advise people to visit. It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors. Besides, this shop is not too far from the known natural games reserve in Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nAnother shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market. This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact. I will rather advice tourist to pay this market a visit to enable them have choices of priceless products.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI hope from the explanations, I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them.

Many of them have got family members, who don't want to have anything in common with fame. Usually journalists also following them all the time. It's very important to remember if you're famous, you should protect your family. Sometimes happens, that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people, which are not true. It may be a danger for family of a celebrity, politician, famous person, because of them some could broke up. But on the other hand, being famous is a free choice for many people. They want to be rich and famous and they know, that journalist will be follow them. But sometimes it doesn't depend on us. If you're a queen, member of royal family, from your birth you'll be observing by press and magazines. It's a price of being famous. Altought it doesn't mean, that press should write about privacy. Public activity is one of the most important thing."}

I mean people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language with different programs that television offers or just put subtitles to make it simple. A lot of important news can be shown to people around the world by TV. It's important to know what it's happening in the world because it can enrich your knowledge culturally, politically, etc. Besides you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if many severe situations are being occurred in your country. Children learn a lot of things with cartoons, it can help them to improve the speaking and to know new vocabulary. The television is one of the most important media. So, for that reason I think  television can entertain and also educate.\nI'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if it's sad or the break of someone's on its free time. Watching TV can be funny and nice but watching it in excess can be bad and not healthy for your life."}

After I receive more and more information about some successful engineer and inventor such as Steve Jobs, I realize that no matter who you are and how smart you are, you cannot live without a healthy body. Consequently, I believe physical development is the necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful for providing me opportunities of extra-curricular activities. \nI like the feeling of getting sweat and a great passion in swimming. Therefore, to maintain my body healthy and my interest, I keep on joining the School Aquathon since I was secondary one. I participated the same events each year. It allows me know my body state and whether I have relapsed. Besides it gave me a motion to train harder and never have a thinking of giving up that I need to keep my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body. Also, under the harsh training, it trains my willpower and setting goal. I learnt setting a proper goal as it is a significant factor to success. This goal push me forward to do better and better each time. I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after take part in School Aquathon and saw others got improved but not just me.\nI reckon learning and trying more kinds of things can change my school life to become more colorful. School work and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to strike a balance that I learnt playing windsurfing. In my eyes, windsurfing is special and indispensable to me. When I step on the surfing board, all my vexation and misgiving were gone. Under the recommendation of my instructor, I joined the Joint school windsurfing competition. On that day I found something wrong with my position on the result board. I was shocked and decided protest for the wrongdoings of the race committee. After several meetings, I got my position back and I have learnt that we should believe ourselves. Also I got trained my body and become more healthy.\nThe hottest issue nowadays is the global warming. Therefore I paid more attention at global warming and ways to deal with it. It is part of my dream that I wish I can have an invention to solve the problem in the future. To know more information having a green lifestyle, I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013. Also, I learnt communication skills with friends. One of the purpose of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle, so I got a better physical development.\nTo have more different experience, I have joined the \u201cDialogue in the dark\u201d experiential exhibition. In the total dark environment, I experience the feeling of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their livings. After undergo this experience, I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future. I get a greater passions in engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life. Also I have learnt the communication skills with others and be considerate. \nUnder the colorful school life, I undergo different type of experience and I finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician. I think it is not a good engineer who only got skills of engineering. Therefore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitted as a suitable candidate of engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal.\n"}

There are a lot of cases known when journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists. And for some people it doesn't really matter if it was found out that someone was in a bar for example as long as their films are really worth watching. Besides,being foollowed by unknown people ought to be quite a scary experience.\n Some people would say that it's necessary for usual people to know how the politician lives so they could know if he should be trusted.

Hey if it\u2019s a kidding, stop it, it\u2019s not funny. Suddenly, shadow covers him and crazy dog falls on the ground and dies. The police announced checkout is the murder motivation. A detective named James Reilly wants to find out the reason for murder and to arrest murderer. He realizes crazy dog killed an innocent man named Joe Mendez last year but his body was not found. In Mendez house in the suburb, Reilly found some old photos showing the sequel of criminals. They all were tortured viciously before death. It was around 9 PM when Reilly was there. Suddenly he hears a weak voice whispering; do not try to stop the shadow, let it kill the criminals or you\u2019ll die. He checks everywhere but can\u2019t find anyone. He sees a shadow out of the house and follows it until it stands at the end of graveyard. He goes there and sees a pile of garbage quickly brushes aside it and observes a hole in the ground. He goes inside it and discovers a half decayed body that was compatible with Mendez identities. He understands that the shadow was ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez\u2019s murderer. \nI think this thriller is exciting because it shows a ghost with killing ability.

Within the town centre itself there is a wide selection of stores offering local crafts, fashion clothing, food or wine. In addition, several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates. There is also an extensive local bus network in order to provide services to all the suburbs around the city. \n\nSpecial shops\n\nAlthough most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of \"Bulls Running on the street\", many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra. As a result, a few shops such as \"LA VINOTECA\" and \"DELICIUS\" have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food. Both shops are located in \"Castillo Square\" and their staff speak English. \nMoreover, a store known as \"KUXUMUSU\" offers all kinds of bulls-related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country's culture.\n\nRecommendations for tourists\nI would strongly recommend that any tourist, no matter about their interest, should visit the special shops aforementioned. There is little doutbt that they will not only find original products, but will also enrich their minds.\n\n\n"}

The drink is so good because it has a lot of sweet flavors and it has pineapple in it.\nI want a kitten but my mom is allergic so we can\u2019t have one. \nI was born in July 25th 2003.\n\nI have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older, he is 17 years old.\n\n My mom\u2019s name is Katarina and she likes to sing, she turns 50 this year. Her favorite food is crab and her favorite drink is a good white wine.\n\n My dad\u2019s name Bj\u00f6rn and he likes Tang So Do and to swim, he is 52 years old.

Personally, I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job, because there are several factors equally important.\n\nI believe that other considerations are as important as money. Firstly, the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned. Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time. We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life. Secondly, the co-worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues, for example, can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working, hence the working quality may arise greatly.\n\nAdmittedly, money is necessary for people's daily lives, satisfying their basic demand. For example, the expenditure of food, drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income. Furthermore, we may need much more money to have some activities, such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days. In addition, in the life-long consideration, health-care would be increasingly important with people getting older, hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard.\n\nIn conclusion, while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people's choice of profession, I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors."}

Especially in our hectic world it is very important to find to yourself and just listen to your body.\nAs a martial artist you start to get a great fitness and your balance will improve a lot as well as your flexibility.

You will find that you will not only benefit from those in your normal life, but also in your job.\n\nKarate can be started by anyone and any age.

My name is Emma and I\u00b4m 13 years old. Now I am going tell you some facts about myself and my life. I was born here in Sweden, actually right here at Danderyds hospital, but I lived in the city back then. When I was about three years old we moved here, to Danderyd. I lived in a yellow house, not far away from where I live now (probably just five minutes) until a year ago when we moved to a much bigger house. I live here with my wonderful family based on my mum Aylin, my dad Tom, my two really annoying brothers Hans and Oliwer, and my two cats Tiger and Smilla. Hans is 10 years old and Oliwer is 7 years old. \n In the middle of the summer we always go to Gotland and stay at a farm, in a little house.\n\n I go by cycle to \u201cFribergaskolan\u201d every day together with my friends Tekla, Julia and Bianca. I really think it is a great school with very kind teachers and students. I like to dance a lot. On Monday and Thursday I dance at a dance-school here, close to \u201cM\u00f6rby Centrum\u201d, called C-style. I dance a mixture of street dance and show dance. \n\nI also like riding horses, that is one of the thing I often do when we are at Gotland, by the way. Right now I'm actually in a riding course every Sunday. We are just three girl, and I think this kind of riding is so much more fun than riding at a stable with big groups and so on.\n\nI really like Spain, we have been there like six times and the reason is that my dad has a project there and sometimes he has to go there for a week or less and we have the luck to be able to join him. I really like to eat sushi and other Asian food, like noodles. My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at \u00d6stermalm called: \u201cNew Peeking\u201d it\u00b4s an Asian buff\u00e9 and they make the best food. \n\nMy favorite subject in school is probably Swedish, English or biologi. My favorite book is right now: \u201cThe fault in our stars\u201d because its a really good subject and it is sad but great story. My favorite movie is maybe \u201cTED\u201d or \u201cGrown ups\u201d because they are really fun movies with some sad moments. \n\nOn the holidays and after school I\u00b4m often with my friends and family. I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost everyone of them in my old school (called Kyrkskolan). One of my other big hobbies is photographing. I got one own camera, it\u00b4s a Canon. \n\nThe biggest accident in my life was probably when I was three years old. It was midsummer and my mum was outside on the terrace. I wanted to go out to her so I open the door on the wrong side by putting my long finger and ring finger in the little crevice. \nSuddenly a powerful wind make the door blow up and squeeze my finger really hard. I screamed and it started to bleed really much. My fingers were almost cut so my dad wrapped my fingers in bandage and we drove to the doctor as fast as we could. They had to sew my finger but in the end everything went fine. And today I got normal fingers.\n\nI like animals very much and I want to become a vet when I get older. I have got a lot of animals in my life. \n\nThree words who describe me best: committed, animal lover, loyal friend\n\nThat was the most important fact about me. \n\nEmma \u00d6berg 7A3\n"}

Making new friends and sharing interests with others are always exciting parts of social life. When it comes to the best way for students to make friends, some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable, however, from where I am stand, joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice.\n\nFirst of all, for the energetic students, doing sports is their favorite. Therefore, joining a sports team from where they can share same interests and relax is the easiest way to know each other. Training in the same sports team, the students cannot only release them from whole day's pressure, but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise. For example, the champions of Olympic Games, China's famous synchronized diving athletes, GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia, the two girls enjoy a really good friendship. They became to know each other because they both joined the same sports team, and then after exercised and played together; they finally become two enviable friends.\n\nAdditionally, cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team. Here, students learn how to work together, how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork, how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self, and even how to negotiate or discuss with others, as well as how to be patient and rational. Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students, I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent. \n\nFinally, joining a sport team will provide a long period of time for students to get along with each other. However, if students participate in community activities, for example, doing volunteer job in the town's library, they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working. Meanwhile, students can play with each other during traveling, but only several days are deficient and most people will not keep in touch with others after the trip.\n"}

Driving is not everyone can do. For example, people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive. Children under certain age are not permitted to drive. For those people, public transportation can be an optimal choice of transportation. \nIn conclusion, cars are convenient, however, it is not for everyone use. Therefore, the public transportation has its own means of existence, and there is a future for public transportation. "}

One of  the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of the society deals with newspapers as a daily routine. They can't withstand one day without skimming through their pages with a cup of tea in the morning. To the best of my knowledge, it is a way of behaving more than a way coping with the latest technologies.\n\nTo begin, the reason for decreasing the popularity of news papers is that most people, recently, rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world. The second main reason is that online news is often free of charge. Thus, people read news at any time and for free. On the other hand, newspapers are presented in a definite place, with limited time in addition they are daily payable.\n\nWhile some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing. It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectful reputation are the ones which could be accepted by thousands of people. In this respect, newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news. Furthermore, reading habits have their own taste, specifically for those elderly people. They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses. That marvelous tasteful generation can't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences upon the modern society.\n\nIn light of the forgoing discussion, it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect toward globalisation even in daily news worldwide. However, the newspapers still have their lead in that perspective. It can be suggested that combination of both arenas will positively influence the ways of delivering news."}

Others, including myself, believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice. In the following essay, I will outline two reasons to support my view.\nFirst, small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection. That is to say, most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T-shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it. For instance, my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me. Therefore, the next day she brought me back to the store, we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one. Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores, you can always find something unique.\nSecond, it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together. However, most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting."}

She knew that besides her, the race will be attended by the best girls from all over the country. Dressed in a swimsuit, she was waiting in front of a swimming pool for the next judges command. Only a few seconds separated her from the jump to the water. The judge ordered to take place at the sites. Anna looked again toward the audience, where her the best fans in the world were sitting - her parents, friends, coach and friends. They all were keeping their fingers crossed. She swam so fast, like a former fish, not a human being. In the water she feels like at home. Only after a while, after a few quick and short breaths occurred to her that she fulfilled her biggest dream. Anna won first prize, regained confidence. It was one of the happiest day of her life."}

I personally think so, the reasons are as below:\n\nFirst, As we all know, Cars play a very important role in our life, the more and more cars come into our family.  Also travelling, of course, that's a big part of the function of the car! The very well developed highways, roads, city streets provide a good foundation for the cars, look at the North America, the highways were developed anywhere, it's really your own lose if you don't drive a car, drive on them(highways)\n\nSecond, Human start to learn driving at the age of 16, and they can master the driving skills very quickly( within a month or two), soon they can drive to wherever they want to go, and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it. so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore?  \n\nThird, The public transportation sucks, when you think about it, you can picture the crowded subways, dirty buses, and the difficulty/hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind. The wasted time also should weight in, whether it is waiting for the trains, or waiting for the delayed buses, not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car. And driving your own car can be very convenient too, it can right come to your own garage.\n\nAll in all, Public transport is not as fast as a car can be; it's not as convenient as a car can provide, so it's future is in doubt.\n\n"}

Being sad and sorry will destroy your life ,because you will not be able to work , eat and live in a good way. All of this will affect your life badly , maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore.\nSecondly, Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives. Look around you , crimes and death are srounding us , all this people are dreaming to live a peaceful life without all the aspects of killing and sadness.People are fighting as they can to only  reach a calm life where everyone of them can be safe.\nThirdly, I lived two years  without feeling safe and comfortable . The war in my country make me feel no longer safe. For that reason I beleive that being safe is  absloutly better than sorry. I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that the life will go on and oneday  all of us  will  be satsfied with this life.\nIn conclusin, I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy ,because you live a calm life without anything makes you sorry."}

However the first 17 days in the movie could turn a bit tedious because the director focused in every single feeling of the trapped men and their families. After that lapse the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescue them started.\n\nThe characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident.

What is more, we can only have to press one computer key to find what we are searching. For this reason the most people have Internet at home.\nOn the negative side, the use of Internet can be a waste of time in our lives; this happens because although search is faster, we can distract looking at other things on account of the attractive of the Internet.

Secondly, the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else.

The article states that the most efficient substituer of internal-combustion engines will be fuel-cell engines, because of their several advantages, while the lecture refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages.\n\nFirst of all, the reading passage says that internal-combustion engine relies on petroleum, which will be depleted soon, but hydrogen will not deplete easily. The professor contends this point by explaining that hydrogen is, in fact, not easily found. She adds that it is not directly usable, because hydrogen should be obtained in pure liquid state, which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees celsius.\n\nSecondly, the article states that this hydrogen use will solve pollution problems, inasmuch as it does not use carbon dioxide, but water. The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem, because it requires to be purified in order to be used. She explains that in the process of purefication, a big amount of coal and oil is burned, which pollutes factories rather than the environment.\n\nFinally, the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic, because it requires only half of the energy of internal-combustion powered cars. The professor says that the claims in untrue, because the material, from which the cells are produced, is very expensive. She explains platinum is very hard to find and without this metal it is impossible to produce hydrogen. "}

You know that Russia is a big country and there are a lot of places to visit. In our country there are few different climate zones with very rich nature, various cities with old and prominent history and culture. I'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience. First of all, you can come to Moscow. As you know, Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation, it`s a very fast, energetic city with lots of things to do and to see. In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries, theaters and clubs, few parks which priveds different events like open-air concerts or public muster-classes. Of course, you must visit Red Square, the Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral. I strongly recommend you to book on-line tickets to Big Theater and visit it's opera or ballet. You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school. Maybe you remember the famous Diagelev's seasons which were popular in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays artists of the Theater try to keep that old school and develop their mastery. In addition,few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it's original appearance. \nThere is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow, you easily can find it in the Internet, I just want to say that I'm sure, you'll like it a lot. \nAfter Moscow you can visit town of the Gold Ring. It's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history. Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia. You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar.      "}

However, as educational institutions, universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them develop academically and socially.\n\n let us look at an example for a univesity student. The student had a great deal of assighment and projects, so he spent more time to access the libabry, becoming more ambition to study books and using a computer to search latest information. Sometimes he felt tired to do papers, going the gym to play basketball. Therefore, not only did he get high score in the reports that absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry, but reduce the study stress and maintain healthy in the gym. \n\n       I had a similar experience. when I studied in the university, I sit in the classes hour by hour in a day. When I finished classes, I would like to access the health center not only to do exercises, but I could maintain healthy. University, I also have a lot of assighments, so I like to go to libabry to study where is more quietly, spacious and internet accessible.

In addition, my academics education also stand out in my student life.  \n\n      For these reasons, I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development. Academic education will always be at the heart of a university. In universities, sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study. I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as well as sports and social activities. "}

I have always loved reading. You never know what you are going to find when you are reading (or writing) and less if you are doing it on the Internet. There are such an interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would have never expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation. \n\nWHY BLOGS APPEAL TO BOTH READERS AND WRITERS\n\nMany people will find blogs and websites useful in order to meet new people. We now that making social contacts can be sometimes a problem for a wide range of people, who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience. However, on the internet you can find not only meeting points but practical and very thought-provoking articles in blogs. In my experience, being under the screen of a personal computer will you be able to show and exchange ideas or opinions easily as if you have to do in front of someone else. \n\nHowever, both readers and writers not only do it as an altruistic and philantropic way but to get fame and popularity at the same time. Blogs and websites could give them the chance to became famous if they really appeal to a large amount of people and they will abe also available to earn money thanks to the publicity . Consequently, we should never blind trust in everything we see or read on the Internet. \n\nTHE BLOG I FOLLOW\n\nTo give an example, I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series, characters, new seasons and when they will be ready to watch them again. If they give us reliable information or not, it usually depends on the source. That's the point of Internet. You mustn\u2019t take everything into account.\n\n\nTo clarify what the situation is, it is truth that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites but the fact is writing or reading in a blog could give to people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies, beliefs or thoughts, however, more or less reliable.\n"}

Besides seeing touristic or historical places, and attending open air activities people also want to see museums of the city they visited. Because museums offer so many interesting and different things differ from other places in the visiting city.  \nFirst of all, people visit museums to learn history of the visiting city. We know that museums generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings. These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life. For example, when you go to Metropolitan museum of art in New York city, you can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American history and also other countries\u2019 history. Observing these items you can get idea about the old times of the visiting place.\nSecondly, museums are places from where you can learn culture of the visiting city. Many items in museums has cultural value beside historical value. For instance art museums  include art collections such as paintings from many different artists. Some of them were made in modern style and some of them in classic. You can get idea the culture of the city from these paintings.\nThird advantage of visiting a museum is that you can have fun visiting a museum. Beside historic and cultural characters, some museums also can be source of fun including attractive activities. If you bored to see classic museums you can go to thematic museums such as natural history museum. There you can see dinasours from old ages. It can be amazing to see different sprecies of animals which are no more live.\nIn sum, museums are attractive places for tourist to discover about the city they visited. By visiting museums we can learn interseting details about the history and culture of that society. In addition to having lots of information we also can have fun to see interesting things in the museums such as huge dinasours. You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you travel.  \n"}

They say it is caused by burning oil, so the society demands itself to enclose it.\nIt is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport, and it is understandable. But while living in a big city, where there are lots of bus stops, tram stops or metro stations is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck at a block while rush hours. As the ecology organisations says, it is better for the environment, and as we decided, it is better for us to save our precious time.\nIncreasingly people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons.\nIt is not true that public transport has no future. The bigger the city is, the more important public transport is. And now, when cities are widening, public transport will be more important than ever."}

The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays. There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world.

Almost everybody have at this moment at least one account on a social media like Facebook or LinkedIn. The positive effect is that it is possible to be in contact with your friends and family whenever wherever. One of the downsides you are not able to get away from your bully. This could drive someone crazy and very miserable. The greatest impact of internet on our life is the use of social media because you can get in contact with everybody around the clock.\nThe internet has a lot of consequences on our lives.

Together with an unofficial Student council create a petition which is to raise the issue among teaching council. Our priority is good preparation for secondary school certificate. For this purpose we need a quiet place to learn. Moreover pupils demand is the possibility to borrow books. It is the most important matter, because most of us is not able to buy highly educational books. They are simply too expensive. Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education. It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge.\nBesides issues that have been already mentioned there is also undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library, it would be more representative.\n\nGiven the rationality of the above arguments, we, pupils, expect a positive consideration to our request. \n\nRespectfully yours,\nPiotr Dudek."}

That's why we have to describe some important ideas related to this topic.\nFirst of all, as we said before the people's lives have changed due two important elements which are the technological improvements and society changes. The first one it is very obvious because every day the researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones. For example, one of the most important devices that has taken an important role in our lives is the mobile phone which has changed extremely fast over the last ten years. Another example is the cars which are taking the same way as well as the mobile phone has done.\nThe second one is very important too because society has changed a lot as well as the people's mind. For instance, one hundred years ago was impossible to see a woman working and carrying on economically the whole family alone or studying a degree in the university, things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society.\nIn addition, there are other conditions and facts that has helped to change the people's lives such as political decisions, global wars and global economical problems, etc.\nTo sum up, there are many issues that affects people's lives and we do not know how it would change in the future, but we are sure that in 50 years from now it would be an important change as well as it happened these last 50 years ago."}

Kadeer Abdul-hamied. I have known Kadeer since 2012, when he joined the faculty of Computers and Information, Fayoum University as an undergraduate student. He attended my labs on \"structured programming\" course during the first year. While attending my labs, he showed himself as an active and hard-working student. We frequently discussed various hard problems in the scope of the course, and I was impressed by his analytical abilities.\nHe also attended my lectures and labs in \"Java SE\" summer training course. He showed up a distinct and intellectual level among other students. Also during this course, he had to work in a team and deliver a project as a requirement for the course. He contributed excellent and innovative ideas during this project and he showed himself that he is an excellent team player.\nIndeed I consider mr. Kadeer as one of the most excellent and outstanding personalities among his colleagues. I believe that Mr. Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for \"Google Student Ambassador MENA Program\".\n\nSincerely,\n \nEng.

I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson you promised me you never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you reached it. You\u2019ve kept working on it for almost your entire life now and although you have not become a professional one you have never given up. \nHowever, piano is also part of your life. When I first introduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements. But again you never gave up and now you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in Town shows how big you are. Proof that not only you are very determined but that piano was meant to be. We have enjoyed music together for nearly 20 years and most of our good times are related to that. \nAs you asked my take what I tried to do was nothing but thinking of you as if you were my son. I imagined the scenario with Mathew coming up to me and looking for some advice. \nFirst off, I would take him to a long journey by car. I\u2019d suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to. Then once we get on the car I\u2019d let the  music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words.\nOnly after driving for a while I would ask him to tell me what he\u2019s been up to lately and if there\u2019s anything he hasn\u2019t told me about but keen to mention now.  At that point I would let his talking go without stopping him from interruption. I\u2019m convinced he\u2019ll speak his thought at once without beating around the bush and all his fear and doubt will slip out. By now he will be able to answer himself many questions he\u2019s been troubling with.\nAll I\u2019ll have to do is just point out what the main points are that he is too dull to see. Because that\u2019s what an outside criterion is needed for. Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive. \nThen he\u2019ll be lost for words as much as he spoke and he will be willing to put the whole thing aside and just lose himself in some drinks, although he hasn\u2019t come to age yet for that. Perhaps the next day he won\u2019t even be able to recall what the speaking was about but I\u2019m pretty sure that after all deep down himself he will know what best move on is to make!!\n"}

Try to imagine that, if everyone in the city has his or her own vehicle, we would be always late due to the terrible traffic jam. In fact, travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves. The reason is that we have to wake up in the very early morning for avoiding the traffic jam to attending school, working, etc. \nThe main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost. For example, a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost. For another, the subway is able to transport a number of people around the city. \nThe second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution for a city. Too many vehicles in a crowned city would increase the carbon emissions. \nIn conclusion, public transportation would still pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well for accommodating a huge number of cars.\n"}

So, we can obtain certain benefits and more doors that can be opened easily. There are some people that spend too much of their time doing nothing useful although others may say that it helps to be more relaxed in their lives. Personally, people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons.\n \nFirst, you gain time doing essential things. By doing so, you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential. For example, when I was 17, I was about starting my first day of class in the university. I started to feel  bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that didn\u2019t have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering, and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology, Laws, and so on. But later when I graduated, I realized how important were those subjects. I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation. That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do\u2014such as taking complementary courses\u2014without rejecting it, because somehow it\u2019ll be helpful later in the life.\n \nSecond, if you avoid doing things only because those don\u2019t like you, you\u2019ll miss opportunities. You\u2019ll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you. For instance, a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city, he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes. He refused to do this. After all, one guy decided to do the venture. He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished, my friend started laughing at him. Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner, and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort. As you can see, my friend lost the opportunity because he didn\u2019t like what he was requested to do.\n \nTo sum up, it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you don\u2019t like it. If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time. If you would rather avoid essential or required things you\u2019ll lose many chances to succeed. So, we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important. "}

Since my view, to use the public transport in this case have two important advantages: the first one you don\u2019t have to care about parking; the second one you can move in a relaxed way reading a book, listening to music or talking with other passengers. Nevertheless, having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays, not only because the petrol price is continuously raising but also you have to pay high taxes for the car. \nIn short, although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than do it by public transport, it is not probably than in the near future they disappear.\n"}

In 1995, there were green areas, however they were cut down and an airport and an apartment block were built in those areas. \n\nAnother interesting redevelopment is that factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre, and in the same way was for Church which was pulled down to take place for a pub. The urban areas were demolished, to make way for skyscrapers. A final notable change is that football stadium was erected in the south of the city in 2010. "}

You cannot know it if you only travel by car. So I think Public transport should remain.\nLast but not least, public transport can share the cost of traveling. Public transport is for many people to go to the same place.

Next to the blow-up of the North American steamer Maine, the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures that it couldn\u2019t be done from the outside, but from the inside. On the other hand, the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notify their results to Spain and with the opposite conclusion of the Spanish commission. However, the Spanish government does not agree with the USA's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with an international arbitrage. Later, the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba, but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans. Mackinley ask for the arbitration of the Pope Le\u00f3n XII in the conflict and Spain reclaims North Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict. The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba. Later, the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to military intervene in Cuba if necessary. The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date. In this Memorandum, the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of the president Mackinley. Also, this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict, which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blow-up of the steamer Maine, the latter being remarked concerning the USA rejected the Spanish proposition to carry out the arbitrage together. The 21st of April EEUU denies the Spanish sovereignty over Cuba, the 23rd of April Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25th USA declares the war to Spain.

Despite some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more rely on car as it is convenient, it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has its future. Two of the principle reasons for this are as follows. \n\nFirstly, the society today are more concerned about environmentally friendly. This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has negative impact on our health and the ecosystems. The more cars on the road, the more green house gases produced. Therefore, public transport play an important role to mitigate global warming. For example, if a bus can carry 100 passengers, at least 25 cars can be reduced on road, solved the problem of traffic jam. In addition, scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles, so they become less harmful to the environment. \n\nThe second argument is more related to everyone and has great influence. For those who do not drive, public transport is extremely important. There are thousands  of students travel with public transport to school everyday because they cannot drive and their parents do not have time to drive them. Moreover, insurance, petrol, repair fees are very expensive. Not everyone can afford it. On the other hand, public transport is good value of money. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport should have future. Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco-friendly, and there are still many people rely on public transport."}

So knowing a lot of languages could be very useful in life.\n On the other hand, learning languages is not always practical. It takes  a lot of time to know any language fluently and it waists time.

At his 5th day of his trip, he hiked a very high mountain, but weirdly he never seen any people. About 1 hour after he started to hike, he saw a big cave and there was a cozy-yellow glow inside the cave. He went in and found an old man standing there. Next to him were few dozens of doors and there were letters written on it. The man spoke, \" Welcome\". He led me to a room which said 'Happy' at the door. When Michael stepped into the room, I felt something very fresh inside me. It was like breathing in a forest. I felt happy. Really Happy. The old man said, \"You feel happy, Don't you?\" Michael nodded. He went on, \"Every room have a feeling written on it. That feeling tells you what you will feel inside the room.\". Michael went into couple of rooms until I spotted a room written 'Anger'. He was curios about how he will feel when he goes into the room. He stepped into the room. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake."}

For example, when fan follow the cab, she or he could be hurt, because the traffic is really unpredicable or when there is a huge mass of fans, they could hurt each other. \nMy opinion is, that the famous people deserve a quiet time, when they are with their partners or with family, but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym. Yesterday I saw in the magazine photo of Sarah Jessica Parker on which she was walking with her dog. The headline was: LOOK AT THE SARAH WITHOUT MAKE-UP, SHE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE! My first though was: \"God, let her live her life! She is only a human being!\" \nWhy when men stalk a women they forbid him to come closer to her, but when a papparazi hide in car of celebrity, he will get a huge pack of bucks for the photos?"}

Years ago, we used to get through with other people ringing up or texting messages by our mobile phone and as time goes by, nowadays we also can communicate by social networks such as twitter, facebook, whatsapp... First of all, we use them to catch up on news, social issues by twitter instead of newspapers, for instance, it's usually to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his smartphone, an image so far from years back. We also can have more knowledge about current issues by Facebook pages which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes such as political discussions, strikes, economy... As far I concerned, nowadays population know more about what's going on in the world than in previous years. One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries where their Government ban to have access Internet to citizens, in other words, they want to mislead about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nets or up in arms against their system. On the other hand, we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends by facebook, uploading photos at any time, taking a coffee, watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere. So, this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossiping at the same time, as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites. You can follow to your favourite celebrities and have a direct interaction but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise to them"}

He was born with a spoon on his mouth. He has everything: the looks, the brains and the charm but he has never felt contented. He has never been serious on the entire 17 years of his life. Everything has been easy for him, he used to get what he wanted. He thinks that life's a game and he should surely win whatever it takes. One of his favourite game is to conquer every girl he liked and break their heart. But that was until he met Celine.\n\nShe was describe as plain Jane of the campus. The never been noticed girl, Celine. One day, in the silence of nowhere while Celine was reading a book she felt someone beside her. It was a new thing for her knowing that someone had the guts to sit next to her because almost all the people on that school define her as a weirdoe. \n'Excuse me?'\nShe looked up and she was surprised seeing the stranger beside her is the famous Michael. Curiosity was written all over her face. 'Yes?' she responded. 'I'm Michael, nice to meet you' he said.. She was starstrucked. She knows him. Everyone in that school knows him and how flirt he is. 'Uh yeah. I know you' she said. Michael thought it would just be easy talking to this girl. Seeing her that close makes him realised that she's not ugly. The word beautiful is not enough to describe her. She's gorgeous, if she would only take off her glasses maybe other people will notice it too. 'Nice then, do you mind going out with me on a date?' he blurted. 'No' she replied. This guy actually ask her out and she's not that stupid not to know his intentions. She stood up, packed her things and went out of the library. \nMichael was surprised. He had never expected that he would receive a no from this kind of girl that is even far from his type. She just challenged him.\nThe past two weeks of Celine's life changed in just a blink of eye. Michael didn't give up on asking her out. Rumors spread that easily. She knew herself that Michael is just playing with her and she said to herself that she will never fall into his trap. If he wants to play, then she will give him the best game he could and would ever have. She's going out with him.\n\nTwo months had passed since the day they dated. Since then, everything went so perfect between the two of them. Celine realised that Michael is not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael's reputation. She baked a cake for him because she wanted to thank him for the flowers she received yesterday. One of the things she knew about him is that Michael loves to surprise, that's why she wants to surprised him too. She's on her way to the court where Michael was practing when she heard guys talking.\n'Do you still plan on finishing our bet or the rumor is true Michael? You have fallen to Miss Jane?' it was Nicolaih Heindric voice. 'I'll do it. Just be patient. I can't wait to have that car of yours' Michael said. Celine knew at that moment that her world had fallen down. Tears automatically falls down her face. Everything Michael did for her was just for a bet.\n\nThe next day while Michael is on his pad watching tv, he heard his door bell rang, he was surprised to receive someone now. The last time he remember he never invited anyone. He would like to invite Celine but he knew she would decline to him again and he's not ready to be alone with her. Maybe he's too coward to admit it but yes, he's inlove with Celine. He tried to deny it to his friends because he knew the moment he told them the truth Celine's life would change. He knew how Celine loves having her privacy, he knew the moment he admit to everyone that he loves her, she would never have her normal life anymore. He just loves that girl that he would protect her from everything. Even if it cost him hiding how much he loves her. When he open the door he was more surprised to see who's on the door. His eyes looked automatically on how Celine looked today. Is it only him or she was wearing a sexy dress? He opened the door wider and let her in with a big smile on his face. Celine came in and kissed him aggressively. The next thing Michael knew is that he is making love with this girl. Everything felt amazing and beautiful. All they could hear was them kissing. 'I love you so much' Michael blurted after what they did then hug her. He felt a liquid falling on his shoulders. Is it raining? he asked himself. He realised that it wasn't raining. Those were Celine's tears. 'I knew everything. Everything was just a bet right?' Celine said. Michael got frozen. 'Everything that happened to us was too good to be true. I shouldn't have believed you. I shouldn't have believe that you will change just for me. I'm just so stupid to believe guys like you. Now you have what you wanted.' Celine said with a broken voice and a broken heart. 'Look away. I'm going to dress now' Celine added. Michael can't believe of what he had just heard. The next thing he knew is that she was gone not only on his pad but from his life. He just lost the girl he loved for the first time. Micheal decided to get dress, he was on the way to the door when he saw a box of things he gave to Celine. Tears started to fall from his eyes. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake."}

Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and furthermore it gives me a big amount of sadness. \nThe next thing about unpleasant shopping are enormous lines. Going for a few food-stuffs always end with an hour in a line. No matter in what time you come to shop, you will wait.\nThe last, but not least reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy everything I want. Of course I might go to a few different shops, but without driving license travelling is tough task. Carrying many heavy bags is not my favourite kind of spending my spare-time.\n"}

It is a sophisticated construction, full of details, everywhere around the theater, from the floor to the ceiling, everything carefully fashioned according to that period. Even if it has more then 100 years since it was built, all the original fashion are still there, intact, with all the luxury ready for everyone's visit.\nThe place set out important concerts, presentations and international festivals until nowadays.\nThe theater is famous not just because of its age, but also because it was built in the middle of the jungle. During the rubber age there was no urban life around the build, which is completely different from today of course since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater, that have the same age of the theater and is surrounded by art galleries, pubs, offices, houses, restaurants, where groups of friends, tourists and families are used to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warm day and during the night.\nIt really worth visiting Amazon Theater in Manaus, taking pictures and having good stories to tell in your life.\n"}

Nevertheless, the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible. The main reason is that the craved stone balls are different types of stones. It is because different stones have different densities that their weights are different though they are uniform in the same size. \n\nLast but not least importantly, the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose. The professor, however, doesn't think so because the the designs of the stone balls are too simple to show the important social status. Moreover, in general, artifact of social symbol is buried with its owner after he or she died. However, the craved stone balls were not found near any graves. \n\nTo sum up, the professor totally disagree with the statement in the reading passage. "}

People can go wherever they want and whenever they want without thinking of buying a ticket or getting to a station  on time to catch a bus or a train. Car gives comfort  because you can personalise your space and your ride. All the same car is also necessity today, because very often that is the only means to get to where you need to.\n\nHowever, public transport is not threatened by car. First of all, too many cars make towns crowded and  create traffic jam, which is counterproductive.

It will even get more popular because it will be faster, modern, and cheaper than a travellng by car."}

The first place would be \"Culture Centre\" and the second one \"Sports Centre\". In the \"Culture Centre\" your young visitors will be able to join daily cultural activities, such as theater, cinema and drawing classes, whereas in the \"Sports Centre\" they will have an opportunity to join many sports activities, such as bowling, swimming, athletics and karate classes.\n\nAdditionally, since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months, I suggest that they should subscribe to a Polish language course. It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic level. The course would be three times a week only, and fully paid by the Polish government. The course will give your young visitors not only a lot of fun but also a general knowledge about Polish culture and eating habits as well. \n\nIn short, a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students.

In the beginning, one of them, looks for a job asking to the boyfriend sister, but fortunately his friend convince him to find another work. One day, finding on google, the two friends discover that google looks for new people to employ in its company. They send their curriculum.

Of course when the groups arrange themselves, the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards. Of course, on paper, this group haven't chances, but the events will demonstrate something of different.\n\nThis film is interested because it drafts work problems but not only for this; it also transmits some important values like, the importance of the solidarity, the group cohesion and the importance not to lose the fait in dreams even if the situation is withstands.\n\nOf course there are also negative observations about this film: for example there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story: they aren't interesting and they during so much time.

It has to be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to asking or to taking photos. If something changes in your life will be a notice in television, and people will invent rumours about you. Not know if people take interest in you because they are real fans or is a person who wants to take advantage of you.\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the statement because if they are public people, fans will interest in them. There are celebrities that sell their life in television and then do not want to journalists chase them.  There are other famous people who not appear in television and they are chased by reporters. This is the result that something new has occurred  and they want to collect information. It is impossible to take a private life if you are a celebrity, because people who love you want to know about your privacy. \nTo summarize, if you expose yourself to television you will not have a private life. The best way to keep it is not be a famous person."}

It is known by Human history at least since 3000 B.C. In many cultures, garlic is associated with superstitions, providing bad or good lucky.\nIn Ancient Egypt, garlic was used by people for heath purposes. The slaves, who constructed pyramids, were fed with garlic, because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger, so they could work harder. In Roman and Greek cultures, people believed in  garlic's magic powers to avoid the Evil. Even Homer cited garlic in his odyssey. In Middle Ages, sailors carried garlic with them to endure long periods in the seas. In more recent years, in the World War I, soldiers used garlic to prevent from gangrene. \nAt the present time, modern Science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health. Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria, revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria. At least 23 different types of bacteria were tested. Thereby, the bactericidal effect of the garlic, probably can explain some ancients\u2019 beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments. It can explain too, why the use of garlic was a good option to prevent gangrene in WWI. Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system. It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood \"thinner\". This can be used to prevent heart attack and stroke. \nTherefore, include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health as some cultures believed.\n"}

There are lot of campaigns going on globally.  Is it worth all the time, energy and money in convincing people to be responsible to their environment? Yes, indeed!\n\nI recently joined a campaign program in Manila, Philippines dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources.  I was very enthusiastic in all the activities not until after that one event. I found out that the leaders of this organization are not realizing the beliefs and principles they are imparting to the public.  They are not a good representation of their ideals.  I backed off and  decided to just continue to do my personal contribution in helping mother earth.\n\nI believe that if we aim for a change, then the change should start with us.  Maybe we cannot convince the whole world participate in helping the environment right away, but it can begin with ourselves.  After my awareness of what was happening in our natural resources, I am very glad to have been doing my part.  I am now living an environment-friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago. Firstly, I cycle everyday to work. This just didn't save me from too much gasoline expenses, but it also made me physically fit. Secondly, I turn off the faucet and the switches when not in use.  Thirdly, I segregate my rubbish.  At home I have separate garbage bins for paper, plastic and organic wastes.  Forthly, I am only buying organic products for consumption and keeping a small spice garden at my backyard.  And finally, I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing inorder to help our environment.\n\nAll in all, I think that helping our environment doesn't have to be big time. We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable.  We have the time now to do what is necessary.  We can begin in ourselves, in our family, in our own homes.  That is a small start, but will eventually reap a huge outcome. \n"}

Indeed, his team was almost at the end of the NBA teams whilst they are in the middle position now. It isn't only that he's a very good player (He is :D ) but also, thanks to his style of play, his assists, and points has served as a lever to his team that has improved dramatically. He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old. His current team is preparing him physically in the gym, his physical form has improved a lot and now is faster, stronger and he's still 23 years old.

I live in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm. A big city with more than one million people. I live in a little part of stockholm called Danderyd. Danderyd isn't inside the city. It's some kilometers outside of it. Because Danderyd isn't in the city it's very much nature and nice people. \nSo Sweden is located in the north part of Europe. Between Norway and Finland. It's a big country and doesn't have many inhibitants. Around 9-10 million people. It's one of the biggest countries in Europe if you think about the area Sweden have. Anyway, about one thousand years ago Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway was Vikings. The Vikings where like pirates that lived in the countries I was talking about one thousand years ago. They sailed to France and England to plunder. But they also where the ones that first discovered Greenland, North America and Asia. The Vikings where feared from most people in Europe but they where also merchants and explorers. \nThe most people in Sweden are christians. But because Sweden accept so many people to flee to Sweden from the wars in the northern parts of Africa and the southwest parts of Asia. \nThe nature in Sweden can be very cold, especially in the northern parts of Sweden. If you are at the most northern part of Sweden it's always day in the summer and always night in the winter. Also when it's winter you can see something called the northern light. It's a strange light in the sky in different colours that is very beautiful. Some just travel to Sweden just to see it. \nIn Sweden we have very good education. Most people go to highschool and unversity. There are though a problem with jobs. It's hard for young people to find jobs in Sweden.\nIn Sweden we are very proud of a free download able program where you can listen to almost all the music in the world. It's called Spotify and have grown super big. There is also another free program that is called Skype where you can talk to eachother and text eachother totally free!\nThe gaming community in the world is growing fast and most of the boys that have a computer play games. In Sweden gaming is really big and there is also one game maker that have made a game called BF or Battle Field. It have been a great succes and is one of the best games in the world. \nWe in Sweden are also very proud of our best football player, Zlatan. He's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries, especially in Europe. \nEven though we have a lot to be proud of we need to make a lot of things better. In Sweden we have a lot of different people from different kultures. The problem is that there are a lot of swedish people that are razists. Not the majority of course but there are many razists. That can be really painfull for those who isn't from Sweden from the beginning. Or for those who doesn't have swedish culture. \nAlso as I said before we need more jobs.\n"}

After a complex and difficult journey, Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community, he has eventually found a  job as a fruit seller in a local market. Despite his high qualified studies in education, Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field.\nThe phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last  decades. However, nowadays even in the rich Western Europe, many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment. This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries.\nUnlike the post-War society, where the European economy was booming, since more than 5 years, Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whose major effects are borne by the youths, including the highly qualified graduates.\nSuch a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools, which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization. Schools and job markets are often separated like two different worlds. Therefore, once graduated, qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market.\nI believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and, therefore, contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis.\n"}

In addition most of the people are not used to walking on foot even in short distances. In big cities where people live a more isolated life and always in a hurry. \n\nEven though there are more and more cars on the roads, I do not think this tendency will completely reduce the demand for public transportation for the following reasons:\nTraffic jams cause many problems in big cities. In those cities where the number of the residents is over a million, public transport system is widely used. One of the most widely used is the subway.\n\nStudents often use public transport between cities instead of cars.\nThere are many people who have experienced a carcrash, or just simply afraid of driving, so they prefer to use public transport system.\nThose  people who has mental or other serious illness doesn't allowed or not able to drive a car, for them public transport system is necessary.\nNot to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers' life and it is less about convenience even if travelling by car means you don't need to adjust to other passengers.\n\nI agree with that there is a lower demand for public transport in smaller cities and towns, but it doesn't mean it has no future.\n"}

We see what they really are, the underdeveloped countries that they are. Seeing all of it we will change our future, doing different things that they have done.\nRecently my country is starting to develop their resources, our renewable energy as wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal energy. Nowadays, we really focus on how we can extract this energy, but not in other important things, like the way that we can start to use it, the correct use that we could give them or how we can reuse the energy. Starting to develop our nation, it is eventually starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment.\nTraditional energies are focus on give to big cities all the resources. Poor people leave their towns to look for a better live, but if we start to give them enough resources and decrease their migration to the big cities, the need of energy would be decreased. Also it is a big opportunity to help them. They need resources to improve their live condition until my country could has the possibility to give them a better live opportunities. It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is big cities, without looking and help the surroundings.\nNowadays my country have started to build a great number of hydroelectric, wind parks and we also starting to think on geothermal energy. But I think one thing that it is necessary before implementing this type of energies. All of that require further studies have been done and with that, we could know the feasibility of the projects and the size of them.\nImplementation takes time and money, but if the project does not work all of that could be spent in vain. Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then build large constructions to extract them. Sustainability is about found the better way to interact with the environment. It is like to make friendship with nature and knows that what it needs of us and show what we need of it. Trying to take care of it, extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage.\nAs I said before all of it needs time and a great number of studies. Starting to interest in alternative energy and try to see forms to use in your native country is the first step. The implementation of projects not need to be only for spending money. In a good way implementation of projects helps to improve citizens lifes. All those little steps help to our nation to build a developed country, friendly with the environment.\n"}

Then comes the problem of human beings.Vegetables and other food planting on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of human may not be meet one day.  Moreover,with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants ,carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines ,which will melt the remaining ice in  the world. Thus,the sea level will go up to influence the climate leading to warmer days in the whole world.\n    As far as I'm concerned, it's critical for governments to take mesures to reduce the problems.Firstly,relevant laws and principles should be put up to forbid extravagent expansion in the natural system. In addition,supervision of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government.What's more,the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually,no matter in campus or in the public places.Anyway,to key to protect our living environment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuals step by step."}

Some people suggest that we have to avoid treating them this way ,while the others maintain the opposite view. As far as I am concerned , the later point of view carries more weight. I am inclined to believe that pets can be treated as a family members because they are  loyal , have souls as well as they are human friends.\n      First of all, Dogs and cats are a very loyal creatures. There are many dogs who are loyal and trustworthy than many people in the earth. Pets can not deceive or lie. Many dogs for example help their owners and protect them from many dangers. For illustration , My friend has a dog, one day when they were in his farm. A snake tried to bite my friend but his dog at the last moment saves him and took that snake away. That is why I love pets. He made an action which many other people could not. For that reason I appreciate my pets as if they are one of my friends.\n     Secondly, reason for my propensity of treating pets as a family member, is that they have souls. they feel as if they are humans. They feel our love towards them and they can exchange this love with us. While they can not express their emotions in our ordinary ways. Everyone has to treat them in a kind way. They will never try to hurt any human being so why people try to hurt them. Domestic animals are a very sensitive creatures that we have to treat them as our babies.\n      Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered as human friends. We can talk , walk and hangout with them. Many people can talk with their pets as if they understand them. One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pets as they are their psychiatrist. They discuss with them many life events. For example, I have an old neighbor who lives alone with his cat. He talks with her and plays with her. When I see him and ask him how do you do. He always told me that we are fine referring to him and his cat. After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness. I do not mind or fear living alone anymore as I have my friend which is my cat.\n       To sum up, as a person reaches adulthood, he needs to decide weather to be a human or not. He has to choose between treating his pets as a family member or not. I would argue that treating our pets as our friends is an indication of humanity. Since they are creatures like us have souls and feelings. They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way. That is why I consider my cat my faithful friend.\n"}

No matter where famous person goes, he must realized, that next day he will be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours. Celebrities don't have an easy life. I think they have no life at all. Beacuse, what is proper in living when journalist following every step the famous person takes? We all are free people and everone deserve to have his own life.

They made that decision on their own. So, I think, that they must have known about the consequences and just live as they like."}

Clothes need to be open and free, simple enough.\nWe all want to feel good what we wear, I recommend hipi style \nclothes, not too hipi, but something comfortable. Of course \nit depends what season your doing the festival. When autumn, winter\ntime then I suggest some other style, it has to be comfotable but\nfashion enough. Maybe colorful and cool blankets when someone gets\ncold.\n\nAll in all, I think those tips help you and I hope you will\ngive those people one good international festival. \n"}

Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones. However, I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating. To elaborate, their story are better as there are more twists and turns in plots. Although the plots full of turns, they still very reasonable, and not make their audience felt that the plots are very strange. Moreover, the special effect are better because foreign movies usually cost much more money than native to make. For example, the first one 3 dimensional movie, Avatar, the movie maker spend a lot of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre. It eventually made very good impression on its audience, and the most important for a commercial movie, it really did very well at the box office.\nAdditionally, people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies. Watching foreign TV programs and movies, their viewers can learn not only foreign language but also exotic cultures. Furthermore, foreign TV are more international and educational. For instance, we can know many foreign news from watching CNN. The news in CNN including events which are happening all over the world.  What's more, the National Geographic and Discovery also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I can't learn from native programs.\nIn contrast, some people consider that domestic films are more familiar than foreign ones. They do not want to learn so much becuase they just watch movies for fun. There is some truth in the claims that watching movies and TV programs is a relaxed activity. However, I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture, or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain, they could get more reflection as recreating. Plus, watching foreign programs also could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation. \nIn sum, although there are some dissenting views, one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs. Although movies in our own country are more popular than past, the foreign movies still play important role on domestic movie goer's mind\n"}

However, television shouldn't be used only for this purpose for different reasons. On the one hand, most people have, at least, one television in their homes, so it is very accessible to everyone. For this reason, instead of entertaining, television should contain educative programmes.\nNowadays, children spend more time at home than before. They are used to manage different technologies as television or computer. I think that children can't be supervised for their parents all the time because they have to work and make home tasks. For this reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television. I' am not saying that television has to educate our children, but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things as numbers or letters. Television is very important to give language skills to children.\nWhen I was young I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things as geography or maths and it helped me a lot. Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation issue to talk with friends."}

Of course if the six of us go together is quite expensive, but if I go only with my husband I don't spend so much.\nI suggest everyone go to this place because not only is the food good but also the owners are very friendly.

There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it.\nFor example, the wider choose of programs from all over the World, allow us to discover new cultures, new languages and new societies without travelling, and this enhance our knowledge.\nIn addition to that, the cost of the television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema, the theatre or Opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone. \nAlso, it is very important to remember that we have always the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when.\n\nTo sum-up, I think television is a very good value for money, the point is  being able to choose what we want to watch.\n"}

However, the art and science museum, it could be the funniest plan.\n\nOther activities in the surroundings.\nIn addition i suggested going by bus around the surroundings of the city, where you can do adventure sports, like canoening, climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoy the countryside\n\nRecommendations\n I recommend that they should do both activities, Valencia city and also de the surroundings.

As Lloyd Cohen (the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis) said lottery play is not economically irrational and uninformed. He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe, but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibilty from scaping from one\u2019s current life by acquiring wealth.\n\nIt is certainly true that people who play are almost certain to lose money. Cohen\u2019s knwoledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational. Some people like to calculated the gain or lose from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams. People don\u2019t invest the money they spend on lottery. They spend it and get those dreams in return. \n\nThough this has been an amusing debate, we the affirmative side, on the weight of our argument and proof, have concluded that lottery shouldn\u2019t be banned in the US and Spain, because it is a tradition, it gives help, hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment.\n"}

The other evening, I stay at home and read books, or do some English exercises to improve my English skills. On the weekend, I wake up at 6:15am but I get up at 7am. I still study French with Mrs Alexa as usual. Saturday afternoon I hang out with my boyfriend, we go to the cinema or the coffee shop. Sometimes, we meet our mutual friend and have dinner with them. I often tidy my room and do the washing on Sunday morning. In the afternoon, I do my art exercises or read books. I always go to sleep at 10pm.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

In contrast, in Taiwan, we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well-organized. Clearly, Taiwan will not be the next Greece.\n\nMonetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy, and, from the empirical experience, many countries have successful applied such policy. In 2012, Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan, which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation. Obviously, Taiwan has its own currency, new Taiwan dollar, and if Taiwan\u2019s economy is worsening someday, Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012.\n\nNot only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty, it also wins in government\u2019s efficiency. According to a global survey, Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness, in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption. Therefore, Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes. Without a doubt, the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people\u2019s welfare.\n\nAll in all, Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well-known for its effectiveness. Therefore, Taiwan would not be sunk down like Greece. As a country, Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create lovely and healthy environment to its civilians."}

These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed, in Europe and Oceania, and, consequently, these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded.\n\nA closer look at the pie chart reveals that over-grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded, with the highest percentage of 35%. This was followed by the deforestation, with 30%, while over-cultivation had 28%. Finally, 7% could be explained for other reasons. It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity. This also needs to be compared to the table. Not surprisingly, these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes, particularly in Europe and Oceania. In the first case, Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over-cultivation, 9.8% and 7.7% respectively. This was a great impact on total land degraded as Europe was more affected, with a total of 23%. By another side, Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over-grazing, which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded. By contrast, in general North America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over-grazing, with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively. for this resaon, this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded, with only 5%.

Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm, when people go and finish work, that is when we get the most awful traffic jams, sometimes it takes an hour to get form point A to B in town which is a terribly long time not to mention parents who have to take their children to school, nursery and then get to work, too. \n\nOn the other hand the bypass might cause a drastic drop in tourism in the town. However, it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway. \n\nAll in all, I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage, because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it's less important.

Else the ticket for the concert I bought the VIP ticket as well, so I had to go before to Birmingham, because the entrance to the venue was at 17:00 and as I live close to London, I had to leave at about 12:00 so I didn't have to rush. I got to Birmingham at 14:00, I think, and then, as I've never been to Birmingham I had to look for the 02 Academy, where the event took place. When I arrived there, I queued for the VIP queue. At 17:00 they let us in the venue and they made all the checkings. After 30 minutes started the acoustic performance which lasted for about 15 minutes, afterwards we took pictures. When everybody took their photos, Emblem3 got backstage to get ready for the concert and after one hour it sterted. I left the arena at midnight and I went to an hotel that I did already book online. On the day after I went back home. It was the best day of my life."}

Nowadays, it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present, while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method. This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely.\n\nFor a start, the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments. In some countries, the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient, which forces people to use private cars. However, it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable. \n\nWhat is also important is the impact on the environment, which is already considerably damaged by human technology. If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed, there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars, yet, as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco-friendly and efficient ways than public transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses. But in the same way as cars development, our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco-friendly."}

There always will be the kitchen,because we must eat, always will be the bathroom - you know why. And in the home always will be a room to sleep and relax. Home in the future may be more modern and safety. Everywhere will be cameras and motion sensors. Kitchen will be better eguipped, may be with smart appliances and people, who can't cook, will prepare the meal by yourself. May be in the future homes will be self-cleaned and we need not clean up.

For example, you must take public transport instead the car because it produces less pollution.

Another problem of the buses is that if you take one during certain hours, it's impossible to find a place free to sit down. So travelling by bus is not convenient, not only for time but also for the problems that you can find. The other question is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia, where, the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy, so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fuel the car directly in Slovenia, where they can find much more competitive prices. My father lives in Pordenone and he sells cars.

They usually go abroad because they have not so much responsibilities just it prepares their professional future. But They can only afford it to work as a au pair, waiter, kitchen porter or porter that include accommodation, normal wages and you don\u00b4t need high level of english.\n\nOn the other hand, you might find yourself getting homesick. Of course, you leave a lot of things, such as your family, friends, foods, places, own things, etc., and nobody put up with being very far away from all these things. Moreover, people about mid\u00b4s 30 years old, they do not usually leave their country and try to get new language from are living. This way is cheap as well and they have not to change everything around their life to achieve this aim. In addition, with this ages, normally people have more charges, maybe children, mortgage, partner, etc. \n\nFrom my opinion, the best way for learning really good a language it is living in the same country where people speak it.

And the most comfortable? In my opinion any transport is completely safe, however people say the plane is the safest transport.\nAnd, maybe the car is the most comfortable. It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTravelling by car can be enjoyable, dangerous and relaxing, I knew this is a contradiction, but I can explain it. Relaxing because you can travel by yourself, with friends and with your family. When you make a long trip you can go without pressure. If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself, and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them, so you will feel less tired.\n\nEven travel by car, in my opinion, has a lot of problems. Some advantages could be:\n\n-\tGasoline is too expensive\n-\t There aren\u2019t enough car parks and they are very expensive, for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking. \n-\tOften you can be involved in city traffic jams, especially in the rush hour. This situation only is present in Caceres when there is a rainy day, but in other cities like Madrid, Barcelona\u2026 is a daily situation.\n\nI think, driving can be dangerous because people must respect speed limits, and not every time that it is. People doesn\u00b4t wear the seatbelt, use phones, and even there are who drink when they are going to drive. All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger.\n\nEvery holiday, the DGT, in Spain, make an awareness campaign to remember us the good manners when we are driving. \n\nOn the other hand, travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport.  I don\u00b4t make sure this affirmation. I\u00b4m afraid to travel by plane. I hate the moment when the plane is taking off, and when it is touching off. I\u00b4m afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon. In this moment there was a tropical storm, and the turbulences are horrible; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane. I knew is the better option when you want to travel abroad. \n\nIt is true, that plane is very expensive, at least I never haven\u00b4t be able to book a cheap ticket. I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it.\n\nTo sun up, all kind of transport have positive and negative aspects, but depending of our necessity we use one or another. For example there are a lot of countries where bike is the most main of transport, like Belgium. I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line, on the contrary than here in Spain, where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona, strengthen their use.\n"}

To support this idea, a study was conducted 6 months ago. The study tried to explain people's reaction to different resources. People where given the task to write a piece of writing of their choice using the resources already provided by the institution in charge. Firstly, they were given 5 books of different subjects. Out of 20 tested people, 17 managed to write their composition within an hour. Secondly, keeping the main task, they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books. This time the study showed that all of the applicants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes.\n  The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten. Thus, this study concluded that in around 50 years from now, people will have worked, fed, showered and even lived without leaving there homes. If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences, we should start to realise how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it."}

For this, we will analyse several aspects such as what local residents do with the rubbish and how Lanjar\u00f3n tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people.\n\nRecycling: The best way to deal with the rubbish\nNowadays there is more and more rubbish because of the high amount of package used to wrap products and increase in consumption. In Lanjar\u00f3n as in the rest of the villages and towns people are getting used to buying and consuming much more than they used to do in the past. However, in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get ride of the rubbish in a conscious way. A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to join several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling. For these reasons, what people usually do with their rubbish in their daily routine is to sort it and put it in the correct bin. \n\nKeeping the village clean and attractive\nLanjar\u00f3n is one of the most tourist villages in the region La Alpujarra; therefore, it is very important both for the council and the local residents to keep the village clean. To get this the council sets different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in. For instance, monthly it is held a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village. At the end of the competition those whose area is cleaner and attractive receive an award. \n\nConclusion\nWe have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us. If we all were aware of this and did something to help it in our daily routines, the planet would thank us for this. "}

On one, hand military service must be mandatory. Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary.\n\tFirst of all, there is no absolutely safety in the modern world. There are different dangers of a military nature such as terrorist attacks, wars and other armed conflicts. Therefore, compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge, which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict. As a result, there are more chances to overcome the conflict with minimum human losses. \nSecondly, the mandatory military service can develop  the character of a person, making it stronger. More specifically, it allows for understanding of teamwork, develops organizational skills and practice discipline. Moreover, it can educate young people be more self-reliant, because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents.   \nHowever, the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact. For example, it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service, because during the one or two years of service, soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military. Also, the time spent serving in the army can uproot or separate families or friends\u2019 relations.\nAnother big problem is that military service is dangerous and has a risk. There are different physical exercises that can be harmful to health. Besides, there are emergencies, which can happen with guns or weapons such as explosions and accidents. Furthermore, there are hazing acts at in the army. It means that soldiers who have already served some time, bully and beat up new recruits for fun. These acts often turn out to be tragic having a long post traumatic effect on the young person or even loss of life. Army years often have an impact on the whole family, especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to the warzone. \nFinally, there is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages, but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world. This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for it. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Because I don\u2019t know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put. Also the food I make by myself is much healthier. Because all of the restaurants want to earn money, so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food. But if I make my own food, of course I won\u2019t use any kind of unhealthy ingredients. So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants. And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants. \nSecondly, it\u2019s much cheaper to eat at home, because restaurants want to earn money. So you can save lots of money if you cook at home. Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat. But actually if you cook much you can use your energy so you can consume your weight. Also if you cook three times a day your cooking ability will go up. \nThirdly, eating at home is more comfortable. When people are surrounded by strangers people all think they are watching me so I can\u2019t do that or this. But if you eat at home you don\u2019t need to be caring that somebody will look at you open your mouth too big or talk too loud. Also the restaurant don\u2019t know how much you can eat, so sometimes they give you too less food you don\u2019t get full. Or sometimes they give you too much food so you have to throw it away. And as you know, throwing food away is a bad habit to do which makes our planet, Earth will be polluted\nFourthly, you won\u2019t have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home. And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait for the chef to cook other\u2019s food first. You can save time if you eat at home. \nFifthly, we can have a family time while eating. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t talk with families when you eat outside. But if you eat at home with your family you can have a joke while preparing dishes or talk about their own private life things. Because it\u2019s not feel free to talk anything outside because the people at the next table might hear what you are talking about. So by having a family time while eating home you can have a talk and be a much closer family. \nBecause of these kinds of advantages and reasons I prefer to eat at home. "}

She didn't know anything and still waited in pain. She could have got married with a talented man if she hadn't believed in what Michael had said to her. Everything is fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend  without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises. Never in her life had she been to as crowded a city as Danang so she feft very nervous but extremely excited about meeting her lover soon. Right after from taking off the plane, she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view of satisfying her long waiting for him. The more excited she is, the more dissappointment she had.

The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones, and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life-altering events. In Rust and Bones, Stephanie injures herself in a brawl outside of a club and wakes up to realize she had her legs amputated. Ali, an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son, saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet. As they support each other through their hardships, love stems.  Similarly, Pat and Tiffany were also going through hard times when they first met. Pat had just gotten out of rehab for bipolar disorder whereas Tiffany, a widow, who had just lost her job. Once again, their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges. In sum, both movies portrayed love as a chemistry reaction that stems out when two people willing to help each other out of life challenges. \n\nIn the movie of Rust and Bone, Ali takes Stephanie going out and swimming, even has sex with her, helping Stephanie to restore her life. On the other hand, after Ali starts his kickboxing career, Stephanie always cares about his conditions, then becomes his middleman. Same as Rust and Bone, in the movie of Silver Linings Playbook, Pat companies with Tiffany to break away from the past; and Tiffany help Pat to get the courage to find the way back into love. All they want to do is to repair the love meanings and find happiness in their life.\n\nBoth the movies lead happy endings to the leads. In the end of Rust and bone, Stephanie is back to her life because of Ali\u2019s support. Ali realizes he loves Stephanie and he won\u2019t be the man he used to be anymore, who don\u2019t believe in love and only want one night stand. And in Silver Linings Playbook, Pat and Tiffany, who both used to stuck in their misfortune in the pass, leave their pass behind and move on with each other\u2019s love and support. This two movies give us a concept : no matter how worse the lives are, love can make people brave and find out the value of lives again.\n\nAlbeit those things in common, at the beginning of the movies, the depression of characters came from different situation.  Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psycologically difficulties; Pat\u2019s desire of his ex-wife can not be fulfilled, while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of her husband\u2019s death. However, characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality; Stephanie lost her legs, and Ali is an impecunious man. Although their hearts are all empty, the harsh environment is more hard to survive. \n\nIn addition, love is portrayed in different ways in these two movies. Silver Linings Playbook, as a Hollywood movie, describes the love story in a hilarious tone. The scene is bright and the rhythm is light even if in the saddest  section. Rust and Bone, on the other hand, presents story in a realistic way. The director does not avoid brutal scenes because those are exactly parts of real life. In conclusion, every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways, whereas people could always find distinct inspiration.\n"}

They both must be solved because of their great negative influence on the world.\nOn the one hand, I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems including environmental one. People always use nature and its resources to satisfy their needs. However, people have exploited the nature since the last century. Their activities caused lots of negative consequences such as air, water and land pollution, deforestation and climate change. These issues are so burning in developing countries. Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems, poor countries have plenty of societal problems, so they continue to influence the environment in a negative way. That`s why I consider that societal issues are the most dangerous. For example, developing countries cannot protect the environment because of their poverty, low incomes, and population illiteracy. \nOn the other hand, sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one. It took place when some natural disasters happened. Such disasters as earthquakes, floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year. It has an unwilling impact on society as people are forced to save their lives, leave or renovate their houses, look for clothes, food and others.\nUnfortunately, we cannot pretend natural disasters, but we can solve societal problems. In my opinion, the main decision is to develop people`s potential, increase their awareness of personal effects on nature. If people take responsibility for their actions, we will avoid plenty of consequences. \nAs for me, we can achieve this through developing leadership. We must have strong leaders who will strive for a beautiful world. People can`t satisfy their limitless needs; they think only about their wealth. A good leader must form a society, show an example and provide better values for people. He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world.\nIn my organization, we strive for peace in the world. We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems. This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society. Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something whereas I don`t know how to do it properly. I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing country welfare. Though the new problems occur quickly in our state some people and community, try to do their best to develop the civil and democratic society. We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems. Moreover, our country pays little attention to them so population should do everything on their own. For instance, I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and economizing energy. These skills are necessary for us, and they help us to improve a little our ecological situation.\nIn conclusion, each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization. What is more, this project will give me available experience including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendency in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment.\n\n"}

The use and misuse of magic of magic plays a vital role in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Each character in this play, who is able to do magic, uses it in a different way, for example: to help; for their own need.\nThe good use of magic is when Oberon use 'love in idleness' to make or rather \"force\" Demetrius to fall in love with Helena.  He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relation ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia consequently Helena in love with Demetrius. It's almost a love triangle!\nThe misuse of magic is when it causes an argument between the Athenians. As Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius and squeezes the potion into his eye, the whole conflict begins. This whole dispute could have been avoided if not for Puck's mistake. However, just as magic caused this chaos, it also resolved in it. Without the misuse of magic, the plot wouldn't be the same. There's be no humour to make it interesting.\nIn this play, the fairies are almost like the heart of the book. It is because of the magic of the fairies, the actions in this book is like a dream.  The fairies nearly control everything. The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania's argument, which makes 'contagious fogs'(2:1:90) and 'hoary-headed frosts'(2:1:107).  The fairies also affect nature as Oberon's and Titania's dispute results in the wind 'piping' to them in 'vain'(2:1:88).\nDue to having fairies as characters, it adds magic as fairies don't exist in the human world. It creates unreality and fantasy. The beautiful language of the fairies (verse) takes us away from the ordinary human world that usually talk in prose. The fairies' magic is built by the contrast of the lives of the fairies and \"mortals\".\nAs a reoccurring theme, Puck's use of magic creates humour, conflict and balance in the play. Puck's magic also adds to his naughty, cheeky, attractive character in this play. The magic of turning Bottom's head into one of an ass', adds more humour to already the self-confident character of Bottom. This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her 'sweet love'(4:3:30). It also creates the comparison of Titania, a beautiful, delicate creature, whilst Bottom is completely grotesque.  The idea of Titania having a 'flowery bed'(4:1:1) and the idea of Bottom, at that time, looking 'monstrous' and 'strange'(3:1:91) creates a distinction. The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her 'lover'(3:2:186) seem ridiculous.\nOberon's use of magic is mainly used to help people. As well as for his need, he uses his magic to help 'A sweet Athenian lady' 'in love'(2:2:260) namely Helena with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2. Therefore, he is shown as a sympathetic character. However, Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania. When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom's head into a donkey's head, he gets annoyed at first at Puck's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a 'vile thing'(2:2:40), a man with an ass' head.\nIn the book, Titania doesn't seem to use her magic much ,nevertheless, she uses it a few times. Titania's uses her magic to 'bless'(5:1:383) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta would have beautiful children and live a happy, married life.  In the book, she isn't shown using it for her own need.\nTitania's fairies are also characters who use magic.  They use it to protect their 'fairy queen'(2:2:12) from 'spotted snakes with double tongue', 'newts and blindworms'(2:2:9-11). Their magic, like Oberon, is used to help people nevertheless not for themselves. Also, the fairies language is magical as most of their lines are spells and sound as if they were in a fairy tale.\nThe clothes of the fairies and their lives are also magical. The place where Titania sleeps is full of 'oxlips' and 'eglantine'. She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies. \nThe food they eat like 'apricocks'(3:1:152)  and 'mulberries' (3:1:153) sound exotic as well as not being our daily  meals or snacks which also shows another contrast between the humans and fairies. The fruits, used above, also sound like ones that would be found in a forest(berries).\nThe language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite. Most of us probably haven't heard of 'oxlips' (2:2:250) and 'woodbine'(2:2:251). Even the sound of these two words sound like fantasy. Shakespeare's choice of words creates this. He talks about 'musk-roses'(2:1:252) and 'wild thyme'(2:2:249) giving us this image of this beautiful land, with green grass and all sorts of flowers. This image will probably look like where the fairies live or associate it with a fairy tale. By doing this, we begin to realize the magic in this play.\nIn 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' there are many spells, e.g.\nFlower of this purple dye,\nHit with Cupid's archery,\nSink in apple of his eye.\nWhen his love he doth espy,\nLet her shine as gloriously\nAs the Venus of the sky.\nWhen thou wak'st, if she be by,\nBeg of her remedy.\nOBERON(3:2:102-109)\nThe language used in this spell contains many references to nature ('Venus' and 'Sky'). This is how it creates magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare's time, they didn't use many props. Just by reading this, you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called 'love in idleness' and you can understand Cupid (the Greek god of love) had blessed this flower with his archery, giving you an understanding that this is a love potion. Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as 'let  her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky' to create the thought that Helena should look like a 'goddess, nymph, ' in addition to being 'perfect' and 'divine'(3:2:137). He uses indirect word, e.g. He doesn't just say love potion. Shakespeare says 'Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery' causing mystery and letting us think about what he means.\nShakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters for example: when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60-145 , she mentions nature many times. She refers to the Moon as 'the governess of floods'(2:1:103) and refers to the seasons quite a lot. She describes the winter as 'angry'(2:1:112) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season. The fairies recite their sentences as if they were a poem or song. 'Spotted snakes' and 'Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9-10) are references to animals. Animals, insects and plants are commonly referred to in ''A Midsummers Night's Dream' and these descriptions add to the magic. It creates the sense that the fairies thought that the animals were dangerous and the way they describe them engages the reader. The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical.\nThis play also refers to 'sleep' and dreams. After all the book is called 'A Midsummers Night's Dream'. Due to the magic, the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream as there's be no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened. Thinking of it as  a dream creates innocence and vulnerability. Also, the thought of all four lovers having the same dream makes it seem strange and magical to them.\nAlso, Shakespeare uses the thought of plays. He adds the play 'Pyramus and Thisbe' which is a bit like a mini play based on the storyline 'A Midsummers Night's Dream' as there are two lovers whose parents don't permit their marriage. When the 'mechanicals' or workers change into their characters, it is a bit like magic.  The characters in the play like 'moonlight' are basic ideas of transformations like ones that magic creates. Also, there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom's head gets 'translated'(3:1:104) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world.\nPotions are also used to show a sense of magic. In the human world, they didn't use spells or potions. At this time, the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion conjures creates magic. The effect that 'love in idleness' has in the play, creates the plot and so potions play a main role in the book.\nWithout magic, the play would not have the same elements of humour. Also, the absence of magic would alter the overall plot. The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play. To summarize my points, I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations, spells, potions and aspects that don't exist in the human world. I personally think, without magic, this book will not be as popular or engaging. Shakespeare has done it again!\nBy Pravinija Mukherjee\n7Y"}

It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them.

So, including in the CV the experience, seems to me, a step further in the students\u2019 career.\n Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification. I entirely share this idea. Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching. Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience.\nI would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of \u201ctraining\u201d for their work life and some theoretical knowledge.

My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have  lots of fun while playing. The shape of the court is in rectangle and is divided in half by a net. The mode of playing can be single's or double's . There are six main shorts: the serve, the clear, the  smash, the drop, the forehand and the backhand.It's a good exercise to make one fit and easy to play. The fun in this game is we  need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait's until the opponent responses to it.  \n\n My suggestion  for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton, firstly  one  need to know the rules and regulations of the play . As it's a mind set game, the player need to focus on the  weaknesses and  act accordingly . To be a successful player one has to  learn some tricks,which helps their game easier. And last but not least as a player one has to keep in mind that ,they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands, where instead of that one has to  fight until the last mint of the game in order to decide  whether  the player is winner or loser  . Thus by boosting themselves lead to success."}

If you prefer to go to the beach but you are not sure what to do there, here are some special ideas to consider. \nFisrt of all, remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess (Spanish omelette, fried chicken brest, sandwiches, ships...) and, moreover, you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming, jumping the waves, surfing and so on. \nPlaying in the sand burying people one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors. \nNevertheless, if you don't like sand at all, you can choose the other option in the mountain. It could be a different way to spend a quiet day in a peaceful, placid and restful place. Furthermore, going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy ciy life, though. \nTheerefore, which one of these two places would you choose?\nIn my opinion, no matter where you go, just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful, amazing even unforgettable moment. At the end, the most important thing is to have and enjoy a relaxing time. "}

Taking me as an example, I do not think I have a sleep disorder. I do not have trouble sleeping, or interrupt my sleep repeatedly. I sure do not get enough sleep but not a sleep disorder, if not, the pace of life I lead.\n\nThe second step is to identify what I could cause the sleep disorder. Even if you have a disorder, yes I can identify factors that may interrupt my sleep. The reading speech of many, but with whom I identify most is caffeine before sleeping and eating heavy before bedtime. I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and that way I can see improvement.\n\nThe third and final step is to try to identify problems at first. It is very important to know how we can improve our health. There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions. Help and put into practice these tips will help us have a healthier life.\n\nIn summary, it is important to pay attention to our health. Read things that can help us live better can be very helpful. Implement each council and tell others about your improvements, is a good way to help others. So for now we must sleep well to be healthier."}

The pollution level is more and more increased by this excessive use. Then, the public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet. What's more, not only increases it the pollution, but also turns out to be dangerous for our sense of hearing.\n\nIn addition, I think the public transport is a necessary service which we should have access to. Everyone can't afford a car or, for any reason, aren't able to drive one. Therefore, it is too important to go on with a public transport business now and in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport but we'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions.\n"}

Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people in order to gossip about them. However, the documetaries are being forgotten and only  a twenty-six percent of them would like watching more interesting TV series like Lost. Moreover, all of them choose watching TV against reading a book as first option.\n\nFinally, I also talked about the clothes they usually wear. It is said that you are that you are wearing but in this report, we can check that it is not certain. Actually, in opposition to the music, young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn.\n\n"}

One way of using transport is to daily travel to work within the city, other way is to use it when you are visiting your friends or family outside the city. There have been good progress in transport in both the aspects. Transport has become faster and more convenient, and it can be attributed to lot of factors such as better roads, new technologies and innovations etc.\n          People who travel daily to work, usually prefer public transport over own car as it is a cheaper option. Also, as public transport such as metro do not need to face traffic, it is always faster way to reach office. On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in nearby town or just on holiday tour, I would prefer my car. If you are travelling in your car, it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination, you can make any number of stoppage, and even stop for your favorite ice cream. In future; environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these transport mediums. Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints, they are trying to encourage public transport. This initiative will surely help countries to reduce pollution. "}

So sport is my hobby, a nice method of having a rest, spending some new unusual life.\n Most of all I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton. There was a such time when I was visiting volleyball club, but I gave it up.I don't know why exactly. Maybe I hadn't enough time. Badminton is what I consider to be favorite. It's easy, interesting and funny. You can train your hands, reaction and legs, because it needs much run. Usually I do this kind of sports with my sister. We have a great time. Moreover, I like to do different physical exercises every morning. It makes my day more productive. When it's a good weather, I enjoy jogging near the house. How could I forget about cycling? To my mind, bike is the best way of traveling. It's also useful for cardiovascular system.\n I'm absolutely convinced, everyone should realize that the most important is health and sport really can help. If you want to keep your body in a good form, you ought to go in for it. If your figure is nice, you will have a nice mood, wonderful feelings. So it's better to choose sport instead computer in order to relax, feel positive emotions.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition, the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard.\nI would like to propose some solutions, as well. The parking should be free of charges, it would attract more people and increase the income overall. Moreover, you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area to certain sections (e.g. clothes, food, and house).  Finally, opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered. \nYours faithfully,\nXYZ"}

Personally I am not completely agree with this way of thinking.\nOn the one hand, if you have money and a lot of free time you can spend all day dodging in the mall for only one, special kind of skirt or pair of jeans. But if you do not have money, prices can only destroy your day because you know that you can not afford it. The prices in the shops often are very high and clothes are not good qualitatively. And when you want to buy something in lower price, you need to go to the mall when there are seasonal sales. But then everybody goes crazy, you need to crowd through the mob, argue with another person for one, special pair of shoes in your size. For me it is only a torture. Also you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets. Otherwise you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need, every thing on the rack is calling for your attention, after a while you want to buy everything.\nOn the other hand if you find a real bargain and buy something in very low price, you will be happy and content for the rest of the day. But in my case, it happen rarely. Some people do not want to buy things by network because they want to try on for example clothes. For me it is not necessary because every seller gives the size of his product and then I can check if this thing will be good for me or not. Also you can always return it like in the stationery stores.\nSumming I prefer doing my shopping by means of websides or auction portals. There I can easily find what interests me, what is in my size etc. For me it is easier and faster way to buy what I want, often in better price."}

So If I can join your school, I will cherish this opportunity and work hard in school.\n\nWhen I was child, my math score was better than other subject. In the College Entrance Exam, my math got the highest score than others. In my university, my accounting grade was better than others. I think I have a talent in numbers, and I can memorize the numbers extremely well. As a result, I am enjoyable to study accounting.\n\nAlso I have some jobs experience that is relevant to Accounting. My first job  was an assistant of my financial accounting \u2018s professor. My job was to find the company\u2019s financial statement that is corresponding to the news report. This work needs lots of patience and time to finish it. Another job was a part-time job in Leofoo Village. My works needs to close the accounts every day, so my carefulness must be improved during the time, because the money didn\u2019t belong to me. I think patience and carefulness are two pivotal personal traits to major in financial accounting.

Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one, because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. \n\nBy the other hand, traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport, cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and, depending on the city, the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience, cars are the most expensive ones. Not only because of the oil'prices, but also the costs of enssurance, the car, the parking taxes, etc. In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come. \n\nTo sum-up, neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option, but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries, bicycles are the best way. Riding a bicycle reduces traffic, costs, ecological impact, and even car crushes. So, what are you waiting to buy a bicycle and put  a helmet on?"}

Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life; but, it should be like this?\n\n   It is certainly true that people are very critic with the appearance. We have subjetive opinions; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea. We match clothes stile with a lifestyle and a personality. That is why appearance should not have consequences in our lives.\n\n   Most people would agree that fashion is something that takes part in our day to day. Normally, people choose clothes that famous wear or appear in the magazines. However, there are people who do not follow that, and they dress the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most.\n\n    I think that there are many different occasions, and each one requires a different type of clothes. For example, in work interwies and work that have a direct contact with the public it is better to use a for or smart style. And same happened with parties, festivals, sports and other events.\n\n   Overall, my personal opini\u00f3n is that we give so much importance to the clothes and the appearance than it should be. Although in some occasions some clothes styles are required, people should have freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear, and it should not have consequences in our life."}

Many people air their opinions based on their own value system. The majority of people tend to claim that having an excellent knowledge or the research field is the most important for school or work successfully. However does the claim really ring true, conforming the real situation? I find myself not on the same wavelength with such an idea. It is my contention that the people, who have the ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances have higher percentage be successful in school or work. \nAs far as I concern, there are a bunch of reasons to support me perspective. To begin with, acquiring the knowledge in today\u2019s world is not a difficult things than it was in the past. That is to say, the investment of the internet make it available for everyone in the world. People can easily obtain the lasted knowledge by owning a computer that can access to the network and have the ability to reading. In other words, the way to get the knowledge is equal to everyone in the world. That is why it is not to be the key point that considered the key to success. In addition, the education has already across the wealth gap. To explain, there are a trend that many universities all over the world setting up the freely courses for the people who thirsty for knowledge, also often invited the famous scholar to give a speech to the public that is welcome for everyone. People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interesting in. Thus, everyone might be an expert. Excellent performance in the field of study has not been determined of factors for your success. \nA case in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently. According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank, the percentage of people using the knowledge in the work field that they from school has surprising reduced in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent, a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of half-century. Say it simply, the things that school teach us were no longer be used in the real world. This phenomenon had been curiously many experts. Does the knowledge from school have any different in the work field? However, after deeper analysis, we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast pace changing world and the text book cannot catch up with it, knowledge is changing from time to time. Hence, this research remained us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor to success instead of having excellent knowledge or a field of study. \nIn sum, there may be some people who may disagree with my position on this matter. They may say that having excellent knowledge or a field of study is the way to success in school or work. However, I think the reasons I have provided in favor of my view point are stronger.\n"}

Nowadays, the statistics show that many people are younger than generations before.\n\nI think there are more younger parents because they do not live in a religious life which is far more stricter. Previously, the most women used to get a baby after the wedding with their partners, but today, it is not so important anymore. \n\nEvery child wishes to have young parents, but is it really better? Actually the teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children. Apart from this the small difference between the ages is also an advantage. Although less experience is owned, they recognize what a child wants to do. On the other hand a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their babies without having experience on that. \n\nIn my age young parents and I have in common that we go out in the evenings. From my point of view older parents can give better advice in every difficult situation. So the child grows up from a teenager to a middle-aged adult and can always looks up to the parents.\n\nHowever the progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life so I believe both are good at bring up their children. To conclude, you can not change your parents anyway.\n"}

National Nutrition Survey(1995) points out that the most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar sweetened soft drinks. Therefore, changing portion size of soft drinks would be efficient to reduce sugar intake for teenagers each time. The limitation of this solution is the public may not satisfied with this size of soft drinks. To overcome it, the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it. This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently.\nAnother solution to this problem would be education. Family education would be introduced to their kids. National Nutrition Survey(1995) reports that teenagers are main soft drinks consumers and the most consumption of beverage is sugar sweetened drinks. Parents` words is key to restrict their kids` actions. If parents educate their children to keep away from soft drinks or cultivate the awareness of drinking water. They would not consume such amount of beverages. However, children my get soft drinks outside the family. That requires parents building a model to show positive effect without soft drinks. Therefore, their kids would follow parents` habits and behaviors.\nIn conclusion, increasing the consumption of soft drinks is one of issues to prevent from obesity and overweight. A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems. Teenagers are main target who drink too many soft drinks. So that parents education and changing portion size could be useful to address the problems which happens around teenagers. If we take these measures within a short period and keep it for a long time, obesity and overweight problem would not happen in our next generations."}

The most people prefer a car rather than a public transport. However the latest studies shows a car is not always more efficient.\n\nThe right choice of means of transport makes a big impact on your time and resources. In deciding whether to choose car or public transport we need to consider many factors, such as length of journey, time of the day we travel, area we travel through, number of us, weather etc. As there are cases where car is much more efficient than public transport and other way round.\n\nThe recent studies found, that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient by combining a bike with a train. It saves plenty of time by avoiding traffic jams and there is no need for searching for a parking space. In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee. Moreover there are discounts for regular journeys.\n\nOn the other hand, the studies showed, in many other cases and especially in irregular trips there is more convenient to use a car. A car is unbeatable for its flexibility. It is much more easy to use a car when going shopping, or making a leisure or an occasional trips. Although, there are some disadvantages of using a car such as traffic jams and a high maintenance cost.\n\nAll in all, in most cases using your own car can save you money, time and effort. Popularity of cars confirms it. In spite of that, studies said there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable. Therefore it has a safe place in our society."}

There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers. However there are those who reject this and are in favour of the use of public transport. I am going to explain why I think there is not future for the public transport.\n\nA great amount of people think that driving your own car has more benefits than using public transport. Firstly, it allows you to go directly somewhere without finding out the information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains. In addition, sometimes you have to combine both of them in order to arrive on time to your work place.\n\nAnother benefit of not using public transport is the time you can save. For instance, if you have to go another city by bus or train to your workplace, the time you waste since you set off increases. Saving time in the mornings allows you to sleep more or to spend more time with your family.\n\nMoreover, the use of your own car has more advantages. Travelling by car avoids getting wet when the weather is rainy. If you travelled by bus or train, probably you would spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination. Despite the bad weather, if you travellled by car, you could park your car near your destination, so that you could arrive comfortably.\n\nHowever, there is some people who prefer the use of public transport in spite of using the car. The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere. In addition, it is often claimed that is cheaper than travelling by car. Although it has some benefits, in most part of the country, especially in the smallest towns the public transport is not enough developed.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that the public transport has no future because it makes you to waste a lot of time, it is not enough developed in small areas and there is not enough frequency of trains and buses. In my opinion it could be useful hardly ever times, so it would be necessary a great amount of improvements.\n"}

This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods. This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and doesn\u2019t necessarily break any rule of personal space.\nSecond of all, as I did say \u201cto a certain degree\u201d, the idea of controlling one\u2019s own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom, which is the complete opposite of what we should get to.

Interesting in the area of research leads to invent and optimize ideas that are already existing. Second, critical thinking which is the deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it, is an important factor of successful research. Also, honesty, originality which is the ability to think critically, independent and creative, and precision let research to be more valuable. Moreover, working as a team for researching, let researchers gain lots of research benefits. Such as, ideas and learning more the best methods to analyze data. All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information. In addition, Clear, easy to understand, and precise scientific paper are one way to represent, share, and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment. Also, Seminars are other good sources to come up and listen to a new idea. Exchange information with other researchers, via scientific papers or seminars, sometimes come up with solutions for other researches' problems. Researchers should not give up when face hard problem with the research and keep try by different ways to solve it and they will do it at the end. To conclude, there are some of an important research principles. Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research, researchers will get results with a high precision. Researchers enjoy their research as an enjoyable activity."}

I was absolutely thrilled to read that you've got a job as tour guide in the Congo rainforest! Well done! I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write, but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams, for which I'm annoyingly nervous.\nSpeaking of nervousness, I think I've found a solution for you to shake off your nerves about using the English tenses correctly. You wrote that this sometimes made you stutter during tours, which made you feel rather uncertain. However, there's no need to worry any longer, if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm. At this website, you can find a clear, detailed explanation of the tenses, with illuminating animations. \nI got to leave off now, I'm afraid. Hopefully you're able to visit the site. I'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there, you'll have mastered the tenses the next time we see each other. \nKeep me posted on your experiences in the jungle!\n\nLove,\n\nSuzanne"}

Entering your car and giving the directions and then having a stress-free drive towards your destination and let a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore.

It takes hours driving to and from, hours where one just have to concentrate on driving, hours gone futile. Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children, the blind, the elderly and others who currently cannot safely drive themselves. On the other hand it will lead to more driving, because smarter driving reduces the cost per mile of vehicle usage. The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption. \nTo put the whole matter in a nutshell the self-driving system is good to prevent accidents.\nHowever you should still be able to drive by yourself you can not only rely on that system it is still not free from errors.\n\n\n\n"}

Like to Asia countries, such as: Korea, China, Singapore, the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive to all students, especially for the primary students. \nFirstly, the primary education and study system of Vietnam is very hard. They have to study a lot with from 5 \u2013 6 subjects in a semester. These subjects mainly focus on math skills, grammar, writing, but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science. All subjects are less flexible and all students are learning the same programs at the same time. Meanwhile, the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system. In a class, there are very few students with many more flexible study programs. The primary students are touch many different life skills by teachers at school. Additionally, the subjects in the school are given with the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students. They also play many interesting sports. \nSecondly, it is not only from the school but also Vietnamese parents of the primary students are also expected in the education of their children. They usually hope that their children get on the highest scores in school. Therefore, outside the school, Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes, such as: math, writing, grammar, \u2026. Consequently, Vietnamese children have not any life skills and have many health problems, such as: short-sighted, tummy-ache, spinal column\u2026 Sadly, the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short-sighted tend to increase in recent years. Meanwhile, Australian parents also care about their children but other way with Vietnamese parents. Outside the school, they send their kids to sport Centre or go to the social activities. \nSum up, Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children. I think that primary students need to spend more time for playing and enjoy their childhood.\n"}

Some insist that no one need bus or subway in the future. However, in my opinion, it rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by based on two critical reasons. \nFirst, people don't want to waste their time finding parking lots. The more people have their own cars, the more space to park is needed. Unfortunately, there is a certain limit to space, so it is not possible that everyone use their car every day especially in mega cities like Seoul, New York, and London. It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway because you don't have to worry about your car while working. \nThe second reason is more important and obvious. It is related to the environmental issues. Using public means help to protect the Earth from air pollution. There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes. The pollution is a kind of global issues of which people should consider seriously. Without reducing personal vehicles, there is no solution of that problem. Surely, the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means. \nFor these reasons, there will be the future for the public transport always. Moreover, it is quite optimistic that people will need more it rather than private transport.  "}

This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people's lives have already taken place. I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong, even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems.\n\nFirst, the development of population still continue, the space for living still a serious problem although, the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper makes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population; however, the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site. The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type.\n\nSecond, the computer system looks like solves the most of problems; however, this system make more dangerous in specific situations. The \"BUG\" must be appears from man-made system because of the incomplete coding. That is why our personal information always leaks to the \"hacker\". For instance, when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet, the hacker may steal the private information at the same time. They will use that information to cheat people\u2019s money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information. This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan; however, police can\u2019t do anything because of the hacker's anonymity. That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist, even the computer system already solved some problems.\n\nOf course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue.

A new, tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for collage or to embark on their professional career. The family financial support, at this stage, seems almost essential. With this in mind, some questions arise: Should young people be given all money easily or should they put in a great deal of effort to get it? Should parents prepare the ground for their sons' success or just let them work hard to build their lives?\n\nWe have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this juvenile generation. Why do we call them youngsters? Because they are so, and there is no trouble with that. But there comes a time when they are supposed to make it to adulthood. At this point, lack of money might be a blessing in disguise. The more they sweat to chase their dreams, the fast they ripen and prize what they earn.\n\nI'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid, though. Don't get me wrong, please. What I'm doing is challenging the way we approach to it. We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time we help the next generations to succeed by their own means. If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid they grow lazy, then economic relief is welcomed.\n\nUndoubtedly, I'm presenting a major challenge to every parent: shall we be able to take care for youngsters provision and yet teach them that money doesn't grow on trees? Money is almost essential, but the way young people learn to interact with this is essential to shape a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort.\n"}

If you consider the cahotic traffic and the long queues to get there and impact of these factores on people's health and people's finances, I'm sure you'll change your mind about public transport.\n\nIn the last few years public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology, flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables, tickets and places. Besides these, the public transport is better for the environment, especially the electric bus.\n\nThe electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment. This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment, because it's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work.On the other hand, is possible to find hibrid cars but they are more expensive than those that works with normal fuel and for that reason people's first option is not this kind of car.\n\nThe theme of environment is very important nowadays and can cost a lot to a country. A country has to pay for their ecological foot and this means as much pollution is produced more environment damage, in other words bigger ecological foot, and consequently more has to be paid.\n\nGovernments will define environmental stategies in order to decrease the costs of ecological foot. Such strategies will involve taxes above poluent cars, the increase of fuel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmental means of transport.\n\nSo the convenience of travelling by car is not totally true. \n\nOf course you are owner of your time and destinations, but it is enough? Think about its impact on your espences and on the environment, wouldn't be better to take a bus, an underground or a train? \n\nIf we consider all the factors mentioned above, probably much people will change their mind.

These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading across mankind\u2019s history. Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea, this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain.\nFirst of all, the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimulus. Those kinds of stimulus come from several sources and they help you in different measures to exercise the brain. However, reading is the most important source to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind. For instance, when you read, you have to associate characters and places, and memorize details. Those kinds of things help to the brain to be more active and process information faster.\nAt second, there are some researches that prove that in general people who read are smarter than people who do not. This affirmation is based in the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain reading books. This is another big reason to take care about reading, because in this competitive world, only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society.\nAt third, when people read, they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what\u2019s going on. That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain\u2019s exercise, because when people have to imagine things, the brain has to be creative, and that kind of process is too important to improve yourself in problem\u2019s resolution and creation of important ideas in real life.\nIn general all the things described before show how important is reading to exercise the brain. So, next time when you try to avoid a book, think first whether you need that your brain works faster or be more creative, because could be a good idea to exercise a little bit your brain with reading.\n"}

First I was really impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster (Clarice) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal). I have always thought of them as really good actors, but they were exquisite in this movie. Not only in their individual parts, but also in the scenes they did together. Secondly, the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and for that really enjoyable. You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story. On top of that was there tension at all times.\n\nThis movie is outstanding, I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it. As I mentioned before, are both the acting and the storyline really impressive. You will be watching with full interest.

I hope it had loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired! I had learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of William Shakespeare. I can\u2019t wait to tell you more!\n\nYou may have thought theatres would be fashionable place for the royalty, courtiers and merchants. However, it was not. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I, play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax. As it cost very little to get into an open-aired theatre, everyone jammed and jostled to watch plays, though the poor stood under bright sunshine and had their heads burnt while the rich sat in the shelter with an extra shilling paid.\n\nAt the same time, actors were busy dressing and reciting the scripts. \u2018Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.\u2019 Do you remember this famous quote from Romeo and Juliet? At that time, males had to work while the female were forced to stay at home and do all the household chores. Frankly speaking, actresses did NOT exist! These actors paid full attention to convenience the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting. They used props, thick make-up, gowns, wigs and all sorts of accessories. The \u2018Juliets\u2019 even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play. What a gargantuan sacrifice of self-esteem and reputation they had given up! One more interesting fact is that, both the lovers in the play were Italians but their playwright had never been to Italy. It could reflect 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors.\n\nThree trumpet blasts were given symbolizing the start of play, yet none of the respected silence would be given. Audience would boo and throw fruits to the actors in case they didn\u2019t like them. Special dramatic effects were thus added on stage. Cannonballs were rolled around to make sound of thunder. Pig\u2019s blood was used during casualties or deaths in sword fighting. Stage trapdoors allowed actors to vanish magically. In a roofed-in theatre, pulleys and machinery were used for lowering actors on stage. Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter, romance, and tragidies. The play lover, King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men. The company changed its name into \u2018the King\u2019s Men\u2019 and performed over 200 plays!\n\nBy now, I have widened my horizons and increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhouses.

My village has been working on this project for decades they have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day\u00b4s everything has cost us a lot of effort we started from the easiest examples (dividing rubbish into different containers) to some that are more complex (renewable energy). We live in an area where its population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human\u00b4s activities; so in our community we have very strict rules when referring to taking care of the environment. The principal things everyone must have at their houses are three trash can for the division of the trash; one must be for renewable materials (rest of food, paper, carton\u2026) another for plastics and the last one for glass.  All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy; (hydraulic energy, solar energy and wind energy) every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy, that provide part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines but if there is no sun the village has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy; not only we have hydraulic energy but also wind energy; in the out skirts of the village there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced. Also our water has one of the best purification methods after we use it we clean it so we don\u2019t contaminate the water of the river or dam.To try to keep the environment clean we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking all the rubbish and controlling the whole area in case there is something not normal.\nApart from this group of voluntaries every person of the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here the bicycle is the most famous way of transport car aren\u2019t common they are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances.  \n"}

Shops could give us even 70 percent of sale, what helps saving more money.\nOn the other hand, doing the shopping is not only something enjoyable. One of the drawback of going to the shop is that we spend huge amount of money. We would buy next, impracticable high-heel shoes, which will spend couple of years in wordrobe.

The large-scale building land are supporsed to be their home.\n\nFor governments, restriction on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems. Policmakers can enact a law in reducing land development. Another method is that natural ecology gardens can be provided to those animals, like birds.

This humble and famous man is called Kinta Kenneth. I choose this man because he was  a significant player during the slave trade. He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa.    He put the Gambia on the world map. The Gambia is visited by many tourist because of him.  This has led to many black Americans to visit the Gambia for investment purposes. \n\n Kinta Kenneth was a captured slave from Naima Juffera. He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest. This was in 1879 during the slave trade period. Kunta was captured because he was trying to rescue his friend who was lost in the forest. He can across the slave master in the mouth of the river Gambia while looking for his friend. He ran away from them but they later captured him with their dogs. \n\n Kunta was sold to slave master in South America. He works very had in the sugar plantation for the slave master.  While in capture, he fought the rights of all the black slaves in the campus. He refused to work more than eight hours a day and he refused to take orders from the slave master. He was refused with food but he kept going with his strike.\n\n He was later given the opportunity to learn English language. He attends the same class with other relatives of the slave masters. He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves. \n\nHe was famous and respectful in the slave Campus. But was later betrayed by his slave masters. He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolishment of slavery.  He died during the demonstration. But his name was written by all western nation newspaper as the brave man. Because of his efforts that lead to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom for captured slave in the campus.  \n\n\n  The Gambia is well known by the adventurers and the tourist. The history of Kunta Kinta is part of our national history.  The stature of Kinta is situated in the entrance of Banjul. Kunta was not only a great man in the Gambia but a hero.    \n \n"}

Some of the workers choosing to use public transport than their own cars. This is because they want to avoid the traffic block.  Mostly, they are more preferring to use public transport than the car because it can avoid the traffic block and save time to get into their workplace earlier. It is also can save the money as the price of the ticket of public transport is cheaper compared to oil cost by using the car.\nThrough all of these points, it is not faulty to say that is the public transport still available and very useful in our daily life, even there are a lot types of cars, which are more convenient. so, there will be a future for public transport because of its own benefits or advantages to human society. It is very friendly transportation where the people from all places, meet in one transport and they can make a relationship between them. Additionally, the pollution, such as haze, will be decreased because fewer people using the car.\nAs a conclusion, there is a future for public transport and it also convenient to use it for travelling.

This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons; firstly it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes.

One can wonder,but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature,written circa 300 BCE. It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body except on his back,because they thought to be dead in the field is far better than retreating.There are accounts to say about a woman who cut her breast because she found her son's body pierced by a long narrow spear-like weapon in his back rather in the chest.\n            So I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture's important value which is giving high rank to bravery.I love to play the game with my friends in my village,a very refreshing game,I would say.

The first step to it was my diary after visiting Sochi with my friend in 2000. I had a copybook where I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trip for me. Since then I have been dreaming  about collecting my impressions and memories. As my sister constantly says You\u2019re lucky because you have a memory of a goldfish You remember absolutely nothing. It took me much to admit this  again fact. In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory) I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures.\nA year ago an idea of beginning a blog encountered me as  advice from an English teacher. He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge. Well\u2026. Maybe it\u2019s really time to make a resolution and do begin writing it.\nI\u2019m going to kill two birds with one stone \u2013 my blog will help me to collect my memories and master my English The third bird  will be my hatred to writing.

For example, in one of the \u201cHamlet\u201d translations the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia in a meantime appears to be a daughter of Claudius (obviously to make Hamlet torture\u2019s completely unbearable). \nIt is close to unbelievable, but at first critics and educated people find Shakespeare rude, unpoetic and unpatriotic (shame on you, blind and narrow-minded people! Once more into the breach!). But everything  changes quite rapidly then. The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original is published in 1828. By 1855 only six plays has left non-translated. It comes to fashion and becomes honorable to translate Shakespeare. Russian society gradually begins appreciating Shakespeare\u2019s skill in portraying  greatness, depth, and complexity  of a human being. \n\u201cThe sun of Russian poetry\u201d, Alexander Pushkin takes his English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare. And his drama Boris Godunov is certainly inspired by  Macbeth. In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov we clearly read  Othello\u2019s features. And these are like nodes on the tree of Shakespeare\u2019s genius. \nSince that time Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists.   We love his simplicity and veracity, we adore his multiplicity and fantasy, we appreciate his straightness and audacity, we prize  his delicacy and his funny bone of course! \n"}

Although, some ideas were maintained; (for instance, the astronomy by Galileo Galilei) the book-burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned, the knowledge could not circulate.  \n Nevertheless, a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg (1440) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato, Aristotle and so on, authors against political, religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word, creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones.

People die, but books never die\u00a8 it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information; for instance, in the inquisition, the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books. Although there was an oral tradition, the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker; so, the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning. Nonetheless, with the invention of the printing type mobile, the knowledge was different for the access to it. If one book was burned, there were ten books more without restriction. In contrast, nowadays, the books are not necessary at all; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge. That is why; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that \u00a8the knowledge cannot be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite. \u00a8\n"}

In fact above all about rich families the children are in trouble with their family, above all when they have their parents separated. Also most of the children grow up spoiled because of the large amount of money of their family, and they grow up with the thing that they want more and more things. But in the other side there are poor people that aspire to become rich. And these people don\u2019t have money for things that they don\u2019t need and also for things that they need. So in this case the money are more important than other things.

Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems.

The more technology we use the more important it is.\n     \n     Technology makes us easy to connect our family, friends and co-workers.

Therefore, if I studied abroad fifty years ago, I couldn\u2019t call my family directly and it is also not an easy job.

It can\u2019t believe that we keep in touch with our family and friends not only voice and message but also video call, now. \n     \n     Technology is one of important part in our life, which has made life more convenient. Before computer was born in this world, we used paper to list something which we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by something. Therefore, we use calculator to count numbers in a few second. In the old age we calculated number by our brain that might lead to some mistakes. Our life has transformed into an easy way by technology. Besides, the grandest invention is Internet. I sit in front of my computer and I acquire news around the world. If I am hungry, I could order some delicious foods online.

Pressure exist everywhere; for instance, your boss was angry and shouted on you or you should carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father-in-law. When you can\u2019t breathe in your life you need some entertainment; for example, you can listened music with your cellphone or watched some funny videos after all things that bothered you. It lower our blood pressure and release our stress. Technology enable us to touch entertainment immediately.\n\n     Technology has changed our life in many ways which brings many advantages for us such as convenience, easy to connect friends and easier to contract entertainment. In conclusion, in these three premises I consider that technology and science is important rather than art and music. Science practical improve our life.\n"}

Soccer is the one of the famous sport for many people. World cup has been the world famous festival. People can enjoy just seeing the soccer game and they are eager to root for their favorite team. Why the soccer has been one of the best sport in the world? Here are 2 reasons.\n\nFirst of all, soccer is more active than other sports. Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory. This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game. For example, American football always has a moment to set the position. To me, it is boring point when I see the American football. I can give you another example. Watching the baseball game also bores me. Sometimes, game just finished with pitcher and catcher's catch ball game. Other athletes just stand there and watch the game just like us. However, in soccer, every single player touch the ball, even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball. On this point, there is second reason I can say.\n\nSecond reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game. For baseball, if hitter couldn't hit the ball, other players would not need to move at all. To me, that is weird. Players are on the same ground and some of people are playing the game and some are not. Playing almost 3 hours, some players couldn't touch the ball. Can we say these players participating in the game? I would not rather say yes.\n\nIf somebody wanted to play a soccer, I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured. Also, I will say you should wear the soccer shoes and socks. Those items will help you not to be injured. Drinking enough water would be good habit to enjoy not only soccer but also any other sport.\n\nNowadays, many people have their own favorite sports but people are starting to ignore other sports except their favorite sport. We need to respect other sports and other people's perspectives. Soccer could be one of the boring sport to other people.     "}

In Prague is many good shops with clothes, souvenirs and many good things to buy.\nIf you prefer to go to nature I can recommend you ours mountains Krkono\u0161e, Jesen\u00edky or \u0160umava. There is very beautiful nature, calm and fresh air. You can go there only for a walk or for some sports like running or cycling.\nIf you go to south Morava, you should definitely try some vines or drink called Slivovice. \nHere is also many nice castles. For example, near Prague is castle called Karl\u0161tejn where lived Karel IV. or castle called Buchlovice which is on south-east of your country near the city Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b. These are very nice castles.\nOtherwise, the opportunities for a job here is quite a lot. It depends what job you would like to do.\nI don't know what to write more.

There comes no surprise that it is totally difficult to find a necessary thing with a good price in a defined time through a crowd.  Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours. I did not managed to get particular one, because of size, which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others  did not seem to be valuable for  fixed prices. So, I did not buy   new shoes that day,despite thatI was happy for getting rid of crowd and shops. \n\nSecond,shopping malls have full places of advertisements and loud songs playing. There is no surprise that a person visits a big shopping mall after his long working day. He is tired and because of winter he wears a warm coat. What does it happen? He hears different kind of songs, advertisements  for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality. The  problem goes after the problem and a person starts to feel sick. Also, It is a well-known fact, that   it is totally hot to be with coat in a shopping mall in winter season.  The problem is that a person has to carry his coat in a hand near his other purchases , what is not so easy.\n\nFinally,not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate. There are some assistants who  if you ask or even do not ask, they start suggesting the best their products as well as the most expensive ones to you. This can make your shopping really annoying, because some type of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of product.\n\nTo sum up, shopping is not always an enjoyable thing, because it takes time, it is often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants, who eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products.  So, shopping does not always provide good feelings."}

In my case is not really a sport in itself, it is a cultural activity which needs a big physical effort. I am talking about dancing, specifically ballet.

You have to be a disciplined and well-balanced person, that's it. Both characteristics will help you in other type of tasks and will improve your future development. \n\nThe start is the hardest part considering that your body is not used to do this kind of sport; however, once you are in it everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active. So, if you are starting it, don't give up because of difficulties are coming, just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity. You will notice how the improvements come up without thinking too much. \n\nOne of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group therefore you meet people and you can make a friendship after a while. You must not be in your own, otherwise you could not dance in a company, so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that, make a strong relationship forever.\n\nI encourage everyone to try it, I am sure you will become a better person."}

These phenomenon caused serious damages to ecosystem and sea life. Further, continuous rising temperature is impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters. There are scientific evidences, that calamities like Katrina, Hud-Hud can be linked to global warming.\nAs global warming can have such serious impacts on life on Earth. It is high time to intervene and take action. Government can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints. For example, governments can impose limits on emissions by manufacturing plants and force industries to help in forestation. Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming. For example, individuals can reduce use of the plastic materials, use public transport to control emission, recycle waste material etc.\nTo conclude, global warming is serious concern which cannot be ignored any longer. Government & Individual both have role to play, in facing this biggest challenge of the Time, Earth is facing.\n"}

After I joined ACU (Australian Catholic University) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia.  In Nepal students study individually, do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused.  Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills.  Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers.  Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion.  At first I felt difficult, stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas, opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture.\nAcademic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning.  Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement.  (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content.  It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks.   According to Hamp (2002), the goal of EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree.  It helps to share the ideas, knowledge, among the students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing and so on. \nIn conclusion, the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question, share my opinion to the tutor. In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group.\n"}

The rising number in deadly car accidents raise an important question to all of us. Is car driving really safe? Self driving cars are steered by a very modern software and this software is so exactly that the number of accidents will be decline.\n\nIn contrast self driving cars are very expensice and much people can not buy it. Self driving cars are very modern and drive with a very highly technically software. Rich people can buy it but people of the middle class not.

Thanks god, I live right in the front of one big park. So, when I wake up every morning, also pushed because I am a very active person, I get such a motivation to go out and do something. \n\nI sometimes practise biking, running, or even dancing on sunday. I practise also swimming in my apartment's pool, and surfing when I manage to get to the beach. But, not only in summer I practise sports, once in winter I practise also fun sports, like skiing, snowboarding, and Ice skating, among others. \n\nSo, when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport, a problematic decision comes to my mind, simply because I like them all. But one of these sports comes to to the top of my thoughts more often: Running. Why do I enjoy running?. I do not have a quick answer, but I can slide some ideas.\n\nFirst, running is cheap. If you want to practise this sport, you can simply take a couple of sneakers, and any light sportswear, and start to run anywhere. There is no need of expensive technical clothes, or special fields, just you, and a place safe and with enough space. Nonetheless, if you really want to get into this sport as a pro, you can get to invest a lot on clothing and gadgets.\n\nSecond, running is simple. You do not need to get any special training when you start to run, you know it since you are a child. That said, running is probably the easiest sport to practise.\n\nNevertheless, once you started to practise running, and want to really get into it, and improve, I do recommend you to take care of your health a to find professional assistance. Injuries may happen for practicing it often if you do not know the way you step, or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs, for example.\n\n"}

When you use the car, you do not have to think in timetables and you don\u00b4t have to pay expensive tickets for travelling. However, I think that this transport has some disadvantages, for instance: if in a small city there are a lot of cars, the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured. Also, when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses.\nRelated to the use of the car, I would like to say that the Extremadura\u00b4s roads need a big reparation because, for example, the road between C\u00e1ceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it. \n\nIn Extremadura, the second transport most used is the bus. On the one hand, there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them. On the other hand, there are buses for travelling large distances. I think that the urban buses have improved in C\u00e1ceres. The last year, the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increase the prices. Now, it is securier to travel than last years. Also, the seats of this transport are more clean and the bus driver go saying the name of each stop. In the bus stop there are devices that advice to the people the minutes that they have to wait to the arrived of the bus.\nFinally, in Extremadura the transport least used is the train.

Do you learn more at school or on placement?\n\nNearly every education will apply a placement in their education program, to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level. But, is it also that necessary? Where do you actually learn more, at school or on placement?\n\nFirst of all before arguing this question, it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same education and school. Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects. After that, having said I can clearly write down my opinion about this question. \n\nI think that at my school the balance of this civil education isn\u2019t right and fair at all. Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get. This makes it nearly a complete self study education, which shouldn\u2019t be that way at this level of schooling. So because of this, the placement is always a step ahead to choose for at this question because they will teach you directly more.\n\nIn addition, on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company. So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school. So this makes it already two against zero for the placement. \n\nAnd finally the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school. When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are off course useful for your knowledge but, the way of following this lessons are not a natural work pattern. In a natural work pattern you have to do, also like school, your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it. This important way communication lacks at school, because it\u2019s a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers. You have to make a test and they will give you a rating for it. While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills.\n\nSo with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion at this question, I think it has not to be explained any further now. \n"}

The necessity declined that working and living needs to be fairly close to each other. Managing long distances seems to be normal nowadays. Moreover, people enjoy being unbound and therefore, they are willing to travel long distances.  However, public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience. Some people go even so far and don\u00b4t assume that public transport will have a future at all.\n\n\nA lot of public services were cut down in order to save money. Therefore, busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to. Especially in the countryside, public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency. Consequently, people prefer taking the car. Firstly, because they gain independence therewith. Secondly, they can visit each place without any circumstances. For instance,there is no need to change the bus. It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running. In addition, the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing. After having had a long day at work, people long to get home as quick as possible.\n\nFurthermore, ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years. Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car. \n\nNevertheless, public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car. For example, it is no parking space required. Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing, especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours. Finally, it still provides a useful way of travel for all who don\u00b4t have a driving licence.\n\nIn the end, the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future. However, it will remain in the future as still many people use it or even depend on it.\n"}

This result in different views of whether people accept it is easier to raise children now a day. I hold the belief that the children are really easy to raise than before.\n\nFirst, the parents only want fewer kids, so the children's resource must plentiful than 50 years ago. I hold the example. My brother only has one child, but my grandfather has four children. My brother's child can very easy to get the toy which he required directly. However, my father never got the toy when he was a child, because too many kids need to be fed. My grandfather must work hard to support his children by additional job. They had no money could use on entertainment. That is why I mention that my father never got the toy when he was a child. Now a day, every child can get more and more resource from their parents because of less competing by other child. That is what I say that the fewer children can get more resource and easier to be raise.\n\nSecond, more and more infrastructures appear in our city. Of course, that must include the health care system. For instance, in the big city we can very easy to find the specific space to serve our children, such as special toilet and Breast-Feeding Room in every subways. These kinds of space can make parents comfortable and concentrate on their care. My brother told me when his baby should be feed when they walked on the street. They can quickly to feed his baby. That is friendly for children and parents. On the other hand, the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system. Health care system also helps the parents to care of their children, because of people can spend less money to recover their disease by insurance. This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care of their children.\n\n Of course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue. That being said, I still feel that the reasons I have presented was strong ones, such as more resources and infrastructure.\n"}

There is the possibility to set up your seat. It is your own decision when you get up, because there are no time boundaries. There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop. If you use public transport for long distances in a city, you will often change the bus. There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed.\nIn conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way.

Such research indeed will fail. Educational institutes should dissuade students.\n\tHowever, if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study, Educational institutes should support students for their study area . Education\u2019s greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example.

Students can learn some things from the course of the research. In the course of the research, students will think how to develop process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem making the research fail.

I remember that I had a drama play which was held just couple weeks before final exams. However, instead of focusing on my study, I paid more attention on rehearsals. As a result, one of my subjects failed because I did not have enough time to catch on the lessons. At that moment I felt regretful and frustrated.\n\nFrom that experience, I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for a successful study. Firstly, to know what is priority is essential for achieving success. Therefore, I avoided social activities during the period of exam. In the same way, Rowh (2006) points out that it is important to get controlled our self. In addition, not only putting things in order but also well-organized planning are helpful to manage times. As Academic skill Unit (2012) states that daily, weekly and semester planner can benefit for arranging our times (P.22). In my case, I planned the activities into a proper time because the planners clearly show me the outline in the near future.\n\nWithout a doubt, this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility to my own learning. More significantly, I understand that time-management and planning are crucial in academic life.

The other big commercial area is in the city center, with a more variety offer, fashion, bars, supermarkets, local food shops, wine shops etc.... Alternatively every Friday in the parking next to Tivoli World, there is a street market where you can find every kind of products, local products, food, CDs, DVDs, etc.... \nPuerto Marina is  more visited than the city center, even when in the city center there is more diversity than in Puerto Marina.\n\nIn the light of the results, I feel it would be to our advantage if we make promotions of the city center as a good destiny.

She wants to try different way of life like the common girls. Both, they pass through a lot of difficulties and lived poor life. The aim of the two personages was to gain a piece of land in America.

Aside from a great blue-print of a well-organized transportation system, which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning, it also involves local culture. \n\nIt is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People's culture. A conscience that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live should arise first. People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to have each two to four of them trap in car, in other words one massive transportation measure against twelve or more cars on the same road. The next is an understanding of what we can do to nature by changing our transportation measure. Imagine the energy that we can keep and pollution that we can stop. We can change, we have to change for a better future. "}

They can afford to buy tickets. For example, my student time, I used to take busses to go to school every day and come back home.\n\nSecondly, The infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars. Traffic jams always happen in the rush hours when there are so many cars on the road. Fossil fuel is running out of resource. It makes the petrol's price increasing every day. It has been affecting to the environment like climate change, increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to increasing the demands of using petrol for private cars.\n\nIn conclusion, public transport would be the excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting.

Currently, the local transport available are buses and taxis.\nBuses in need of repair\nThe most used public transport is the Bus. The town is covered with more than thirty lines most of them with a duplicate performing the same path on the opposite direction. However, Buses are mostly used by very young people and old people. Children often use them to go to and back from school, and the older population, with increased problems seeing far away, prefer to use the bus to travel around the city. In my opinion, the biggest problem with buses is that they are becoming very degraded, and in desperate need of repair. Most of them don't have air conditioning, meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot, and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter.\nThe alternative - Taxis\nFor the average middle-aged person the logical option is to use a taxi. Taxis are available throughout the city, and can be called by a simple phone message. The bad side with taxis is that they are still very expensive, with all the extra taxes and different zones.\nRecommendation\nThere have been rumors of the contruction of a Metro in our town. That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation, since they are fast, aren't affected by traffic, and they are generally cheaper (since they rely on electricity). Another option would be to create a system to rent bicycles; this has been done in many cities with great results."}

I\u00b4ll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting for them for sure.\n\nFirst of all, if they are staying in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, they can spend there at least three days with sightseeing. Anyway they must visit our main square with many historical buildings. They can climb on \"Black Tower\" and listen to singing from the town hall. There is a huge number of shops in the centre so what about doing shopping? Sightseeing in this town is for tourists very convenient because they can reach everything on foot.\n\nIf the weather is nice, they could definitely take a trip to Kle\u0165. It\u00b4s the biggest hill where you can go on the lookout tower and it\u00b4s not far from \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. There is an interesting observatory too and what\u00b4s more the best restaurant I have ever been in. They must definitely order the best soup in the world. The best way to get there is by car.\n\n\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov is worth seeing as well. There\u00b4s a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle placed on the big rock. They can see there 2 brown bears and lots of souvenirs shops too. You can take a bus there.\n\nI hope your friends\u00b4ll be satisfied with my tips.

I don't agree with this viewpoint due to several reasons.\nFirst of all, vehicles designed to carry large number of people cannot be unnecessary in big cities. Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiles. It happens not only because of environmental aspect, but mental as well. Regular citizens seem to be tired of eternal traffic jams and yards, filled with parked cars. Thus, it is absolutely possible wish of average person, who spends most of the time in downtown, to replace a car for a bus or an underground. The main reason is general fatigue from the huge number of vehicles around.\nSecondly, taking into account of long-distance trips cannot be avoided. Whatever type of journey you took, you would be more likely to prefer using train or plane, because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical tension. Mental one cannot be excluded, but that is the different question.\nOverall, there are a number of causes to disagree with the suggestion, that individual transport is getting more and more popular in comparison with public. The only thing, that definitely should be changed in the future, is an approach to usage of  cars powered by gasoline."}

However, traditional teaching method, force-feed the students, has made me overly dependent on teachers in China, which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately.  Compared with EAP course, it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently, especially for academic writing.  Firstly, it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time, because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers supervision, so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently.  By this trend, I have became a procrastinator finally, which enabled me to face the problems of time management.  In this sense, the term, \u201ctime management\u201d means the ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks, and planning effective scheduling of time to balance study and work, and keeping concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal (Academic Skills Unit, 2012, pp.22-25). \n\nDevelop a strategy in studying is vital.  Rowh (2006) states you will stay up late for accomplishing assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance.  Therefore, the best way is leaving 30 minutes everyday for reading and beginning to read at once.  Based on examining my actual experience and research, I noticed that a gap, unsuccessful time management in independent learning is the root cause of these problems.  Then I made a few conscious changes that I began to manage duration for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks, as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life.\n\nAs an independent learner, it is my sole responsibility to autonomic learning, which is a very important factor in future passing EAP1 successfully, as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia.\n"}

People also have a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages. This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China by some examples.\n Firstly, there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site. So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses. In recent years, there are some different size of logistic companies have been hold, and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly. For example, in the past the main transportations were ships, trains and trucks, so people had to wait long time for their parcels and letters. However, now the increasing number of consumers and logistic companies has chosen airplanes which can save much time to transport their parcels.  \nSecondly, there is still a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China. The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy. However, because of the increasing standard of living, a growing number of people have chosen to travel which has brought a heavy pressure of transportation. So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people, the government and experts have to think some different ways to solve this problem. For example, some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centre. \n   In conclusion, globalization on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effect to Chinese people. So in my opinion, people need to find right ways to let globalization push the standard of our living whereas discussing its advantages and disadvantages.\n"}

Vietnam is a small country but had defeated two big nations which wanted to turn Vietnam into their colony. With strong patriotism, Vietnameses nowadays are trying to develop the nation, to get in the globalization progress. However, as a resident of the country, we can not forget about the history and about our ancestors services rendered to the nation as well as our culture and ideology. As a reward for their efforts. \n Each nation has their own historical places, Vietnam is not an outcast, we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past. Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture, custom and tradition. We can mention many places such as Sword Lake, H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 prison, Temple of Literature...\n  Today, I will mention about one of the iconic places of Vietnam which you can not miss when travel to Vietnam. It is Temple of Literature, the first university of the nation. Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly's dynasty. In spite of wars and the destruction of time, Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now. We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time. As many other Asian country, in the past, we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius, a philosopher from China. He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society. The lessons that scholars at that time were received, most of them were about his ideology. Otherwise, they learned mostly about literature, poetry. \n We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts. Firstly, there were 3 main gates, the center one only for the king, the left side one was for administrators, the right site one was for military. Scholars only could enter by a small gate from aside. Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside. One remarkable, featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination, then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles. Right at the moment entering, you can see them from two sides of the courtyards. Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now. Before the university entrance examinations, many students come here and wish for their luck. \n Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy) can be seen as the most featured historical place in Vietnam. It contains not only the history but also the culture, customs also it is the first official institute which you can not miss out. \n"}

Also, you meet a lot of people while you practise sport.

For example, Kyoto is a popular place to visit because it has a lot of invaluable temples.  Sapporo is an attractive place because raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat.  Among these places, Mt.Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan because its scenery is so beautiful, it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities.\n\nThe first reason is Mt.Fuji has very beautiful scenery.  For instance, in winter, Mt.Fuji changes to a white face by snow.  The white Mt.Fuji is very beautiful, so it has been the subject of countless works of art such as the 'Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji', a series of \u201cukiyo-e\u201d paintings by Hokusai.  Also, in summer, almost all the snow on Mt Fuji melts and it changes to brown and green colors.  At a summer sunset, Mt.Fuji is so majestic that many pictures and paintings have been done of Mt.Fuji at sunset.      Depending on the season, Mt.Fuji makes various beautiful sights and it always fascinates many people.\n\nThe second reason is that Mt.Fuji is a popular mountain.  People who come here are so many.  A lot of travelers and climbers come to climb the mountain and more than 200,000 people climb to the top of Mt.Fuji in a year.  In addition, many cameramen and painters come to record the beautiful landscape of Mt.Fuji.  Also, many observers of weather, stars or space come here, since this is an important place to observe weather, stars and space.\n\nThe last reason is that Mt.Fuji offers several exciting leisure activities.  Climbing to the top of Mt.Fuji is allowed in late July and August.  To climb to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters.  However, numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful view such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt.Fuji.  Besides, a marathon takes place ever year.  This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope, so people who are proud of strong body try this marathon.  Furthermore, around Mt.Fuji, there are five beautiful lakes and many hot springs.  These offer a camping, fishing, cruising, and taking a hot spring bathing with a nice view. \n\nEnjoying an activity with a nice view is relaxing to people.  Japan has a lot of good places for relaxing, but the best place is Mt.Fuji.  Mt.Fuji has beautiful scenery, it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people.  Mt.Fuji will continue to give wonderful impression to many people forever.\n"}

In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely. In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material (glass, plastic, etc.), and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins. So, almost everybody, who lives in Budapest, has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection.\nIt would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible, and there are factories, where they use this technique, but in Budapest we usually don't use much recycled goods recently. And it is a serious problem, because in the not so distant future we won't be able the handle the garbage-it won't be enough space where we could deposit that.\nAn another (one could say the most) important question about a capital city is: how clean is it? In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful. In spite of the number of the cleaners, the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague. Naturally it's mainly depends on us: if we could put our garbage into the dustbin, instead of letting it on the streets, it would be easier to keep it clean. However, it wouldn't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often-it's just a matter of organisation."}

The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught. When hitting ball back successfully, he would say ''good, keep going or you did it''.

Unfortunately, the reality impels me to admit that young people has more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advance that older people tend to not understand well. Also, because of the fact that the urbanization have not helped most countries to adapt the cities into places more accessible to senior people.\n\nThe new technologies are something that we cannot love without anymore. But, unfortunately, the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master, especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university (older people). I am one of the fortunate people who was born on the technological era, which means that I have had access to computers, gps and mobiles, for example, since I was a little child. The technological equipment help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them. The fact that these utensils are familiar for youth make them helpful and useful. On the other hand, to someone who did not have these when they were more young and active, such as grandmothers and grandfathers, the new instruments are just things that they cannot use nor understand. The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home, on the street, in a museum, etc.\n\nAnother transformation, which is corollary from the advances that humanity have been seeing lately, is the modification in the cities and our living habits. Since last century, the world population is more present in the bigger cities, which, as a result, have been increasing in size and in problems. The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities are sometimes not suitable for all public. For instance, older people or the ones with disabilities have great difficult to use the metro system because of the number of stairs. My mother is a perfect study of case for me because she cannot well the transportation system in Paris or New York without been lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting. The mobility of older people is certainly reduced if compared with a younger person. Sometimes, the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement around on big cities compels the older population to stay at home. In this case, they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives.\n\nTherefore, the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who is capable of understanding how to manage the modern instruments and use all kinds of transportation. On the other hand, for the older people, the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to enjoy all that there are out there.\n"}

The question is if it is good to take a leaf out of their book and I am going to talk around it.\n\tIt is good to have your unique value system, but the stories about people who have been doing good affects you and your future decisions. Probably if you hear about heroic attitude you will be able to do without doubts something magnificent as well. In this way I think that is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous. The second thing is that if you are in trouble you\u2019ll feel better than usual because of well-known dramas based on factual stories which happened to the famous people. How the English say: better the devil you know.\n\tThere are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them \u2013 it is called low self-assessment. Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities\u2019 private life and professional career you have to remember that the media distorts reality.

It is one of the best places in our town where teenagers can develop their artistic skills.\nGOOD POINTS\nThe school provides lots of different activities for those who are interested in music, drawing, dance and theatre. Students are taught by the highly qualified  staff. More than that, all the classes are free. The atmosphere at school is very creative. During the whole school year a great number of exhibitions, concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well. \nBAD POINTS\nThe worst thing about the school is that not everyone can be accepted to study there. Children have to take entrance examination.  The other thing is that students are not able to refuse attending some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is definitely worthwhile to study there, although it is advised to let students choose the activities they prefer.\n"}

The number of these people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world. In my opinion, homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without a shelter.\n\n        First of all, being without home is a horrible problem. One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen.Everyday on news We see the refugees who are in a miserable condition.They live in tents that do not protect them of cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food.In addition , financial crisis ,almost of the  companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing. After a while the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live ,and they will become homeless people.Furthermore, children street  is a result of families troubles.Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems.  \n\n      As opposed to the idea above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger on our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for this.\n\n    To conclude, the world has a complicated issue,so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem.The homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life.\n\n"}

And the Doctor Who, Sci-Fi TV series of BBC, exteriorized this terror from the Weeping Angels. They appeared first in Blink, one of the Doctor Who episodes. After Blink was broadcasted, it raised common fears about statues to tele-viewers in Britain and over the world. According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine, Radio Times, the Weeping Angels were picked as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about half of respondents. These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of Doctor, like the Daleks exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe or the Cybermen transforming all living things into cyborg.\nThen, what makes the Weeping Angels frightening? To figure out the factors, uncanny theory is used. Uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar. This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non-living as life-likeness. In Blink, Weeping angels\u2019 uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation.\nIt is hard to read the Weeping Angels\u2019 thoughts and emotions from their ash-pale face. They look unnatural, in spite of their similar appearances with human. Usually, they tend to hide their face, since angels could not move free when they watch each other. And expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre, due to the deficiency of pupil. Also, their facial expressions are almost flat as dead pans. These factors make angels more grotesque psycho-pass assassin. Then, it seems that these statutes might lose their spirits, only when they got our gaze.\nBy the way, the exterior traits of Weeping Angels are not enough to make people scared. But when it comes to their interior factor, the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious physiological reaction into conscious one. The angels move and attack free, only when people blink their eyes or turn around their sight away. However, people blink their eyes several times a minute and they are hardly aware of blinking. After the Doctor\u2019s warning, they may not turn our back, look away, and blink as we are protagonists of the episode. Because it seems like, if we do that, angels will come out from TV and attack us! Then, strangely, blinking our eyes becomes conscious behaviour.\nMoreover, there are good scene settings to make people not blink by immersing audience in that situation. In several scenes, Weeping Angels, the lonely assassins, never shift their positions and postures, even though protagonists and supporting players blink, look away or turn their backs. Why do they not move, even if their prey is near? The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously. To change the pose of the horrific statues technically, directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally, for a moment. At last, directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels!\nAt last, Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar. After Sally, the heroine of Blink, takes the TARDIS key away from Weeping Angels in the deserted house, they shadow her quietly, as if they might be laid there for a long time. For instance, the angels camouflage themselves as monument of tomb in grave yards, carvings of the cathedral on the streets, and ornamental carvings in front of an antique police office. Consequently, it makes audience unfamiliar with their circumstances. Then tele-viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab up blankets tight!"}

They are usually aiming to avoid the hygienic problems. Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules. \nJapanese, as pointed out by Trompenaars (cited in Morrison , 2006), is highly influenced by the values of universalism. Similarly, the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence (Hofstede 1994) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self-disciplined. The main reason for Japanese that they always follow the rules is to respect and hope not to cause any confusion to other users. Also, Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment. As a result in Australia, conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture (Hofstede 1994), people may usually emphasize in their self-satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public. They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users. Consequently, the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems, such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues.\n\nIn order to achieve cost efficiency, the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered. A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration. Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia. "}

It is a majestical castle conviniently located on the river. It's a huge breath-taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens. The place is fascinating, because it is loaded with history and nice to spend a day and relax in royal gardens. I also recommend going to the vaults under the cathedral, where since the 16th century many kings and famous Polish people have their graves. The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see, while visiting Poland. It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle. I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit, because it is beautiful, full of other worth-seeing monuments, cute small cafes, various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside.

I might put on a mirror on the interior side of one of the wardrobe doors. \n\nWell, I have already explained in detail how I would decorate two of the room sides, so now I am going to tell you what there would be in the two remaining walls. First and foremost, though, I have to say that I am eager reader; that being said, it may be obvious why I value space so much: I need a place to put my books in. So, resuming what I was saying, I would place two or three bookcases, filling the remaining space this way. On the other hand, aside from my bedroom, I would love to have my own reading nook, where to read peacefully. So, if my mental estimates are correct, there should still be enough  space available to also place a little armchair, where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk, not very far from the window. Oh!, also, it would be really nice to have a footstool, too.\n\nAs far as television is concerned, well, being honest, I haven't been watching much TV for years. So, at most, I would put on a fourteen inches one on the top of one of the bookcases. Nevertheless, it's something dispensable for me and, for this reason, I think I could get by without having one.\n\nNow that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom, I am going to talk about its lighting. Firstly, I would only use energy-saving lights to illuminate my dream room. Secondly, my idea is putting on, at least initially, two lamps: a white overhead one and a red desk one. Regarding the desk is just beside the bed, the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head; that way, placing another lamp in the furniture would be unnecessary . Lastly, I could consider also putting on a standard lamp near my reading armchair, but I would need to actually set up and use my dream bedroom to see if it is really worth it. \n\nFinally, concerning the bedroom colours, I believe the walls should be painted of a light colour, like white, beige or, maybe a light green. The ceiling could be the same colours as the walls or, perhaps, a darker hue than they. I sincerely doubt that I painted the furniture, though, so they would display the colour of the wood they would be made from. Lastly, I would like that my curtains were red, given that is my favourite colour; however, I would use maroon, which is quite similar, for the curtains because it is more sober and, consequently, more suitable for my room."}

I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone. Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport, it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space. At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously. For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work-load of public transportation. Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot-driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week. But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make a right choice? Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation. And underground, light tram system are still more ecological and fast."}

In recent years, public transport is really common in our lives. From the Metro system, the bus, the train, and the high speed rail, all these public transportation become more and more popular. Lots of people really enjoy the moment when taking public transportation because they are more convenient, cost less and more eco-friendly.\n     In my opinion, taking public transport is more convenient. We don't have to drive by ourselves, and we don't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination. What we have to do is simply go to the public transport stations and there will be vehicles that will take us to anywhere we want.\n     Additionally, taking public transport cost less. Compared to driving a car, it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single travel. We have to pay for the oil if we drive and we all know that the oil price goes up every year. As a result, I think more people will prefer to take public transport rather than driving due to the high price of the oil.\n     Finally, taking public transport is more eco-friendly. Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time which leads to greenhouse effect and the rise of the average sea level. We don't want these natural disorders to continue. Taking public transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders. So, as a member living in our mother earth, we should do our best to protect her. From this point of view, I don't think public transport has no future.\n     The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statemant that the public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient."}

People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life. It can have influence at their work. They can have better position, work for foreign company, communicate with foreign companies etc. It can be the benefit at school as well, because if you need some information for some project, you can look at foreign literature too. Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school. If you want to try this option, you need to have a very good level of particular language. It is very good that these days schools offer you more languages for learning to choose from and they recommend learning at least 2 foreign languages. Of course it can be different in each country. Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them. It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey. For example, which way you should go, where is good restaurant, how to travel in a country, how to solve your problems, where is the cheapest accommodation and much more. Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from  all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country.\n\nAnd what are the drawbacks?\nI think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language. One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them. It can be really interrupting if it still continues. And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what are people speaking about in foreign language.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today\u00b4s people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language.\n"}

In the past,most people consider the museum as the best way to get along with the unfamiliar land. However,the situation has already changed.\n\nFirst,as the technology developed,we may find visiting museum is far from convenient.People using new technique has gradually constitued the majority.The online visiting is a good point in this case.The Forbidden City,one of the most famous museum in China,has opened its online version to the public,which means people can visit the Forbidden City on the Internet instead of taking a time-consuming flght to Beijing where the museum locates.It leads to an increasing number of people choose to using the online museum.\n\nOn the other hand,needless to say,the limitation of museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings,it is far from an enjoyable visiting when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and no touch. The scenery, the beauty of mountain and river,can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own.Once I visited the museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in France,but when I got France to see the real painting,I found it is more vivid and can show you how great the France caveman who painted it.\n\nAdmittedly,the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country. However,more often than not,the high price of the ticket of the museum can ruin the fun when you get to the coutry.A documentary,a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method.\n\nVisiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country,but not a best way anymore. If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land,the museum is not a wise option.\n \n"}

With technology we will clean our house, technology will  protect us, with technology we will spend our free time. In every room we will have a big screen, where we'll be able to see, where are our children and if everything's ok. Our fridge will tell us to buy a fresh milk, if there's no left. Our bed will tell us when to go sleep. I have only one question. Will we live in that house alone? Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us? Machines can tell us lots of imporatant information. Does it mean that contact between people will disappear? I think it's something nobody wants, but it can comes true. People use machines and robots because they don't want to waste their time. But maybe they could stop talk to each other, because it's waste of time too. I hope, It will never happen.

Working with kids  makes fun and safety a high priority. In my opinion, to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe.\n\n  Creating fun activities is an important role of the summer camp workers. As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7-10 years, I have the ability to create and perform fun activities.In the last summer, my kids and I created a fun morning and afternoon program for our neighbors we called it \"multi-balls multi-fun\". In the morning program, the kids have enjoyed playing football, soccer ball, basketball and water ball. The program has included many competitive activities  that full of fun and cheerful. In the afternoon, the kids have enjoyed a multi-dance program that has different international dances. the kids have loved learning new dances and cultures \n\n   Safety is a core component in the summer camps' activities. while designing fun activities, the camp workers have to take in concerns the safety level for these activities, the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed.  As a retired nurse, I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention. I used to assess and treat many injured kids during my work journey in many hospitals.In addition, I have the experience in providing the basic,  the advanced life support, and the airway protection. While these situations are rare, they need an effective fast intervention to save kids' lives.\n\n   In conclusion, I think providing fun in safe environment is the main component in summer camp that each family is looking for. as a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun, to provide safe activities and the most important is my ability to intervene in the emergency situations "}

Moreover, nowadays many education channels are developing to help the students. Mathematics, English and environmental knowledge Quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children. We can also improve our moral attitude by watching the discussion and speech by the outstanding leaders. So, I think advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the watching person.

The old man said to him my son needs surgery today or he will die. Tom asked him the cost of surgery. The old man answered 20,000 $. Tom asked him about the insurance and the old man said the insurance only pays 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease. Tom told I can give you 5000$ but what can I do for the rest of this amount? He thought I should perform a show to jump over the several wrecked cars but it was too risky because he had not any experience in this kind of show. Moreover, he needs some people to advertise for the show. He talked to his trainer Jack and explained the problem. Jack said I know someone who can do that but how we organize the show. We need advertising and to find a suitable place for show until 3 pm. Tom called his friends and asked them to advertise by any means they can and also he requested his trainer to talk to the owner of the race road. It was 5 pm and too many people came to see the show. Tom yelled: ladies and gentlemen, please help us as much as you can because all of the income of this show is paid for surgery of a sick boy. Tom sold all of tickets quickly and earned enough money. The old man became very excited and glad. His son was cured and in recovery room Tom visited him and they became friends. It was 10 pm when Tom arrived home.

Today I\u2019m going to introduce a book about nature that I\u2019ve read recently. The book is called \u201cLiving Through a Natural Disaster\u201d written by Eve Recht. The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters, for instance, the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin, Australia \uff1bthe Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America etc. It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters. The book is also very readable, not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overview of handling natural disasters, so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon.\n  The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is that the people who live along the Yellow River, how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and make a better solution. At the beginning, the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns, villages and farmland. It became a mass killer and make people homeless. People were forced to flee by boat because of the flood. People living along the river wanted to prevent the flood coming again by building dykes. However it made the situation worse. After day of heavy rain, the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed cannot withstand the water when it out of its limitation. The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas .Fortunately, the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed millions of people.\n  While I was flip-flopping through the pages, I let my imagination run wild with the story. Let\u2019s think about how we treated our mother of nature before. Now she is extremely angry after human beings did something really hurt to her. After all ,she is very kind-hearted and always helps us have a good living. Even though the mother of nature is complicated sometimes, she would give us a light of hope. She never just shuts one door, and she also opens another one.\n  According to what Charles Dickens said, \u201dit was the best of times\u201d, because the people can get rewarding from the nature and get a better life because of the fertile land which can feed us. However, \u201cit was the worst of times\u201d also. People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and there is no end after many years unless the government take an effective action to stop flooding. It is arduous for people living in devastating surroundings. The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization. It carries a lot of memories from the past to now, whether it is cruel to people or not.\n  Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets. My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people in the Yellow River. Meanwhile, a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought-provoking words. I sincerely recommend this book to everybody who wants to broaden their horizons and know more than you have known already.\n  That\u2019s all for my presentation today. Thank you for listening!\n"}

In this essay, I will think about the effects of these popular sporting events.\nThe World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, North and South Korea are two countries against each other, but every year they still have a friendly football match. During that time, the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship. The fans, supporters shout, they even cry together. The sports game events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations.\nOn the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. Sometimes the sports games are full of tensions over flow. The patriotic emotions explode in unaggressive way. For example, during the semi-final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia team, the players played quite violent, the supporters of the two teams were very tense. Even after the end of the match assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams.\nI think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games cannot be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations. \n"}

Therefore, we can feel the enormous role of music in our lives. \nTo my mind, beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts. People enjoy it and do not think about its genre. For example, there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries. People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it. \nBeing the core of culture of a country, it influences on national fame. For instance, in our country music consists of two main parts: Mougam and Folk music, which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung. However, modern music is not always acceptable for different people. Despite that it is held by the majority of countries.  To take account that it has been improving day by day, we can meet the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music almost in every country.

You can make different tourism depending on the city where you want to go.\nFirst of all, I would like to talk about Extremadura. Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good weather all year. However, I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Autumm because in summer it is too hot. In Extremadura you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfrag\u00fce Nacional Park or Tajo-International Natural Park. Moreover, you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones (I recommend you this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it) or small natural lakes on the North of Extremadura. Also, Extremadura has many towns and cities with an impressive ancient neighbourhood, for instance, C\u00e1ceres, M\u00e9rida, Trujillo, Guadalupe, Alc\u00e1ntara...\n\nOther places that I would recommend are: the towns of the South of Andalucia which have clean beaches, cold water and a good leisure with many restaurants, shops, parks, zoos, aquatic parks... \nOn the other hand, near Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches which water is very clean and warm. In particular, I recommend you to go to Baleares Islands. However, if you want to go there, you must fly or go by ship. \nIn addition, you can visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches. In the North of Spain the weather is colder than the rest of the country, for this reason, the water of the beaches is very cold and it is very difficult to swim there. However, you must go and know these unforgettable places.\n\nYou say in the letter that you want to work for three months. I think that you can try look for a waiter job in the towns with beaches during the Summer months. It is easier to find a job in the beach than finding it in the centre of Spain. \n\nI\u00b4m looking forward to seeing you.\n\nBest wishes.\nBea"}

I have been involved in summer camps with children from different background and diverse needs. In particular, I have been dealing for 10 years with children with disabilities. Such experience has been an eye-opener for me. I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at the daily life with differnet eyes.\nChildren can indeed teach you a lot, being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack.\n\nA few years ago, I had also the chance to work for 1 year in a school for disabled children and youth in a rural area of Ghana. It was impressive to see the strength showed by those children. Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core, children with disabilities were growing very independent and strong, despite all the challenges they could face on the way.\n\nDuring the year in Ghana, I was part of a team of volunteers working with children. After consulting some children's representatives, we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area.\nYou do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition.\n\nAs volunteers we were also helping the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room. Moreover, I had the chance to share with them the recipe of Italian pizza. Since they were already baking bread, they quickly learned how to make a delicious pizza as well.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it. My experience with children from different ages and Countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your Esteemed Company.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarco Bruno\n"}

Being on the court,it appears to be funny, gives me a feeling of fulfilment.\nPREPARING FOR THE GAME\nNot everybody knows how much devotion and determination requires being a good player. You just surely have to work your fingers to the bones but it's definitely worth. It's also not said but tennis is one of sports which causes an enermous amount of injuries, so that's necessary to be under constant control of your doctor! Despite all obstacles, I wouldn't change this entertainment on anything else. The amount of pleasure which I can get it's simply incomparable to anything else. \nADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nIf I were to start my new sport career, I would choose a good medical care at fist. Maybe it's not a vital part of being a well known sportsman but it's important when you want to work something off during your career. The second thing, it's a quality of an equipment. There are a lot of bergains and cheap items on the market, which very often catches our eye but I want definitely warn you against it! Don't be mean and spent as much money as it's needed. I hope that you won't hesitate any more and that you start playing tennis at the moment!\n"}

It is situated in Kagran and can be easily reached by subway. It covers about 60 shops. The mall is linked to an entertainment section, called \u201eDonauplex\u201c. The Entertainment section stays open after the mall closed. There you can find a cinema, some restaurants and bars.\nOn the countryside you can find the recently edified mall named \"G3\". I would recommend you to go there by car. It contains nearly the same shops as the \u201eDonauzentrum\u201c and several restaurants and caf\u00e9s. \nThe \u201eMariahilferstra\u00dfe\u201c is the perfekt place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls. This street is one oft the most popular shopping streets of Vienna. Even the most extravagant shops can be found there. It is not only worthy to attend the street by day but also by night. Beside the shops some nice bars and restaurants can be found. \n\nRecommendations\nTo not to lose the track I am going to give review. Espacially on a rainy afternoon the \"Donauzentrum\" and \"G3\" are the prefekt way to spend your day. To people who prefer spending their time on the countryside I would commend a visit on the \u201eMaria Hilfer Stra\u00dfe\u201c.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n\nJames Mehler\n"}

The technology has changed us much faster and more dramatic than we used to think. We had to carry a map for our adventure 10 years ago. Nowadays all of what we need is a full charged smart phone with the Google Map application. In the past people could only have a purchase from store to store by themselves, now we can browse almost hundreds of goods on line and buy it through a simple  click. For this tremendous outcome I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years, with greater extension to every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn my imagination, the future would be more messy and crowded with less species of creature but more of us, the human beings. We will face the more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution. Some of the countries will be submerged entirely into the sea, some will survive, and less space for increasing people. Fortunately the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living, to clean air for breathing, and to purify water and food for supply.\n\nOther than the situation I mentioned above, we will have our memories and knowledge being replicate in the form of digital data. We can access all the knowledge from the Internet as we need. When we have a dementia (a steady degeneration disease of our brains ) we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of on-line \"Big Cloud\" memories. No longer do we suffer from studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we known though the linkage to the huge database online. Also, we can change our emotions by releasing some invisible chemicals which can trigger off reactions in our brains. We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects to our personalities. Moreover, our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns even the physical functions corresponding to  the changing environments or simply by our specific commands. However, the more we feel convenient, the more damages to our intellect. We don't have to think too much about almost everything, needing no person to company with since we have all these distractive devices for joy and relaxation. The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of these unrealistic convenience we have. \n\nIt sounds like a scary science fiction, but it may happen if we keep pursuing only values of materials. What thing the most important is to set a right direction for the future of us. We have a lot of problems waiting to be solved. For example, saving the endanger wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient. Time-saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives. Nonetheless, we have to confront the truth that the resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly. The top 50 riches in the world hold most of the power to control the direction of our future. "}

Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture, the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts, exhibitions, festivals and so on! From the main capital you can easily travel by train or plane and reach in a few hours all the major cities both in the North and in the South of the country. \nAs you arrive during the summer, you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking, with such a clean water and golden long shores. In connection with your desire to find a job, you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field: as you wrote, you're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations. By the way, a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests.

This is because people who have a good sense of humor can bring joy for others. Also, people could have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor. Moreover, people can use their humor to overcome some difficult issues. I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis. First, people who have a good sense of humor can make others to laugh. Moreover, we can feel happy easily. For example, my friend, Jane, talks lots of jokes to let us laugh out loud. We like to talk to her because she always can bring happiness to us. Also, we can forget lots of annoying things from our work. Consequently, we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor. Second, people can make a friend easier when they have a good sense of humor. For instance, my mother always has lots of new ideas, and she likes to tell people in a funny way. Also, after people talked to her, they always wanted to talk to my mother again and are eager to be her friends. In this case, people who have humor can make a friend easily. Third, sometimes a person who has humor can help others to overcome some difficult issues. To illustrate, my niece did not get a great score in his test. His mother told him that he did a great job because he studied so hard. Also, his mother told him he would do better next time. My niece had courage after his mother talked to him.

My \ncountry, Indonesia, is full of natural attraction. It is an archipelago, surely many spots of tourism here. Beach, island, culture, and culinary are the common interest to explore here. If you would like to see wonderful beach, you could come to Bali, Lombok, Sulawesi or Irian Jaya island. If I can say, beaches in those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java island. \n\nYou could travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali or by  train from Jakarta to Surabaya, so you can take a plane from Surabaya to Bali. If you choose to travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali, the trip will be much shorter, spending only two hours. If you plan to enjoy your trip along fresh greeny landscape in Java island, you can travel by train. It needs almost 15 hours, but you could have the view of villages during the trip. Basically, I like to travel by train for enjoying the view along the railway track. Also, you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian, just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here. \n\nIndonesian people are famous with their friendliness, so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia; they will answer your questions with pleasure. Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply  a smile with a smile,  so you can start with it; not all Indonesian speaks English, but most  students could speak English. I suggest you to choose college students, because they are more familiar with English, besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability; when you are going to use public transportation, you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason, not many Indonesian speak English. \n\nBali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people, many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia. Lombok, Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya islands have very beautiful beaches as well. The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than other islands mentioned above but other islands are more challenging and natural.\n\nIf you like hiking, you could explore mountains in Java : Semeru, Ranu Kumbolo, Bromo, etc. Joining community of hiking student can be useful, because they will be pleasant free guide for you, this trick has more effective budget for your trip. Another way, you could follow agency to get a guide, but it is not free, you have to manage cost for the service.\n\nIt can be little bit difficult to find temporal job here, unless you got any connections with agency or local people. Teaching English is common job for foreign people, moreover foreigner teacher is more likely than local teacher. May my advice can be useful for your trip in Indonesia. "}

There are some reasons for this situation. Personally, I think this development has both positive and negative sides.\nThanks to increasing living standard, people are able to afford a bigger and expensive wedding. If in the past, they just hold weddings at home to save money, now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead. Secondly, it is likely that nowadays people focus more on appearance, so luxurious and elegant wedding is an occasion for them to show off. It let people to know that they are important or powerful. Finally, people have more relationships in life as well as in business. Therefore, the number guests invited to the wedding are much more than that those in previous time. A bigger wedding is required to meet this change.\nObviously, expensive and larger marriage have some benefits. It is a special case to bring people together. As a result, more new relationships are created, people get more chance to co-ordinate in business and help each other in life. Those who losing contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again. Furthermore, modern weddings bring to people new experiences about food, lifestyle and culture exchanging.However, there are also some drawbacks it bring about. These such big and expensive marriages waste a lot of money and time to prepare. Grooms, brides and their parents usually have to book restaurant, hotel, invite singer and famous master of ceremony to make the wedding serious. Instead of that, this amount of money can help the couple buy house or car for a new life. Last but not least, in some cases, only for the sake of showing off, many couples, after getting married, have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt for wedding expenditure.\nTo conclude, marriage is a landmark of individual. However, a wedding with a reasonable scale will either satisfy the guests or reduce the burden for the couple and their families."}

The increase in the fuel cost for example, will have surely a negative impact on the use of private vehicles. Moreover other costs will act upon the prices of travelling by private vehicles. \n\nIn the same surveys, the researcher show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car. The annual average of crashes caused by public transport measures of 43%, instead of the private one that is around 76%. \nAs for the pullotion, it could be reduced if people use the public vehicles; it is well-known that the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public means of transportation are 80% less  than a car.\n\nObviously the quality of public transport has to be improved. Significant changes have to be done either to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches, trains and other public means of transportation.\nIn this way the customer can feel comfortable as they fell in theirown cars.\n"}

That could be a higher problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could raise 60 % in the next 10 years.\n\nThe reasons for that may lay in the current financial crisis that is strongly affecting over most middle classes in the country. The low quality  in products that young people eat and the little variety in eating habits could get things even worse. Besides, too much use of computer and mobile phones is not helping to mend the problem at all. Finally, it is proved that youths are devoting less time to do exercise than they should and as a consequence, they are not  improving their general health enough.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I think Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in young population. Furthermore, Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle.\n"}

However note my emphasis on adult, healthy and able-bodied, for young people, for older people, for people with disabilities being able to drive brings more costs than benefits. A public transport system is much more convenient for this group of people because they won't need to worry about the skill and attention needed for driving. Furthermore the monetary costs in the long run are much better using public transport both for individuals and for the wider society."}

I know you love doing sports,in special golf, and it helps you a lot to be in shape, but, do you really have to do it? Is necessary for your health but, what about if you go running in the mornings? You keep doing sport but in another time.\n\nOn the other hand, I know that music is your passion, and in my opinion, you shouldn't give up music classes, when you're stress it helps you to relaxes you. Also you're about to finish your classes, so if you give up music, you will discard all your effort.  \n\nAnyways, if you feel that going to your music classes is stressful and you don't have time to do it, try a new sport! maybe soccer, or go running in the mornings as I said before, believe me golf is kinda funny but you don't exercise too much as you could.\n\nI hope this letter help you to decide whatyou will do.\n\nSee you soon!\n\nElena\n"}

As a result of this many studies have shown that athletes shuold be motivate to push themselves above the record. You need a motivation to believe in your self that you can achieve it. This attitude is especially true to Sportsman and women. Swimming includes all these abilities. One of the most difficult sport on the Earth will learn you what it means hard work, sacrifice, pain, strain but also satisfaction, determination,  pride and struggle. The complexities in swimming are not only for the body work out but above all for the mind. If you want to swim evryday pushing yourself above your limits, you definitely need a strong psyche and a solid motivation. People that would to start this sport,they should know that this is not just a sport. This is life. You certainly will learn to fail and win but the most important thing that you will lern is never give up. \nFuthermore like Michael Phelps said: \"There will be obstacles, there will be doubters, there will be mistakes but with hard work...there are no limits\".
