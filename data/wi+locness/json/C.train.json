It usually starts with small talks or compliments, as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships. A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time. Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic, however, they should respect and support each other even if they disagree.\nAll in all, even despite the fact that making friends can be a struggle (they need our time and efforts), they give us support and love and improve our mood when we need it most.

Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages. Well, I think it has future. \n\nFirst, there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams. The metro, which is a means of public transport, solves all these problems. In smaller towns without underground  there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area, so, all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you'll reach the destination. One shouldn't forget that using public transport helps to save money. It's not a secret that gas, insurance and reparings are costly. \n\nSafity issue is very important also. It is obvious that  is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with  an only person inside. You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive) pose a greater danger to road users than  than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic. The answer is evident, I think.\n\nAnd the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just don't want to drive, so the only way out for them is public transport. Moreover, cities' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment, lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity.\n\nSo, my opinion is that public transport does have the future. Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well.\n", "id": "1-43953", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "8760"}

One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968. This flick  stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details. The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot, as well, sticks to  Shakespeare\u2019s work. \n\nThis remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century. The film, instead, was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn\u2019t even been filmed in Verona. It\u2019s about the tragic fate of two young lovers whose families are bitter enemies. Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly get married. The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village. The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple\u2019s death.\n\nThe acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task, and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly.

Sadness stroked her heart.\n\nBut, just as hope almost disappeared, she had remembered the words of the old lady. And so, she had looked around to find a way. Then she had found a gate nearby. As unbelievable as it seems, it had been a gate of time. It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed, but Alice's willingness had been stronger than her fears. She, without any hesitation, had gone through the gate.\n\nFinally, after much time travels, Alice had this feeling.The feeling of the end of her great journey through time. She went for her last journey.\n\nThe first thing she saw was a young girl. She looked at her and was instantly reminded. That girl, indeed was Alice herself in her youth.

Disassembling games, building things of wood and playing Lego were my favorite hobbies. Through the years, my interest in machines and electrical devices increased, so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance, and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down.\nWhen I was in secondary school, and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists, I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer, so I entered the scientific branch. During my study, my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics. Also, I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry, that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering.\nSince I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering, I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America. After searching and asking, I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities, and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways. Moreover, Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories. Additionally, the living costs are quite affordable.\nFor those reasons, I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad.\nI have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation. I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations. Therefore, I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university.\nI have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to. I read about TU-Clausthal and I decided to apply to it for many reasons. First, I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program. Second, TU-Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de. Third, TU-Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center. Finally, TU-Clausthal located in fascinating nature.\nI hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world.\n", "id": "1-194031", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "28208"}

Although in some places people don`t speak English, you always can find somebody who does. \n\nIn addition, English is not too difficult to learn. Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions, the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days.\n\nOne of the subjects at school is English. Therefore, we have to study it, and when we finish school we usually continue improving our English before learning another one.\n\nAll things considered, I think that English is the easiest option when you want to study a language.

Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment, it was welcomed as fun and informative. It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore.  But we have now entered a new era of the attention-grabbing business: its digitalisation. \nTheir transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day.\n\nThose involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia, advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. \nThey have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance. Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them. The result are insincere, misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with.\n\nPerhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter.  Imagine a world without adverts, for a week at least. Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy, or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite?\n", "id": "1-68244", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "11894"}

I live in Djursholm at Riddarv\u00e4gen 42, close to a field. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family we are five people, my mom Malak, my dad Claes, my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like to do sports because I like to be outside. I compete in skiing and I think it's very funny. I often go skiing in \u00c5re, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year I ski with my ski club (T\u00e4by slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn (the mountain that you see on toblerone package). It is a very cool mountain. I do also ski with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow. In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called K\u00e5lhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun. You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful.\n\nSomething else I like to do is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them.\n\nI read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it. Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is\u2026 Of course Harry Potter. But I do also like a movie called The game plan. It is about an American football player who doesn't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter came to his apartment. Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I don\u2019t want to say  because then it is not going to be fun to see the movie. I don't see movies only I look at some series to. For example Pretty little liars and Modern Family. Pretty little liars is a little bit scary but I like it. Modern family is my favourite series. I like it because it is very comic.\n\nMy favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia. It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sing cover songs and I think she is a really good singer. I do also like a song called classic with an artist called MKTO. One band I like is One direction I think they sing really good. When they were in Sweden I was on their concert and after that my voice were almost gone. But there was really fun to be there but is what pretty cold, because on friends arena the roof was open.\n\nMy favourite food is sushi or a fillet of beef with potatoes and b\u00e9arnaise. I like sushi because the combination with fish, rice and soya makes it delicious. I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with b\u00e9arnaise, it is a very good combination. My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called dahlboms in \u00c5re because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever. \n\nHope you enjoyed your reading, I think this is what you maybe want to know about me!\n", "id": "1-95848", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "15945"}

About six months later, I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then, my love for computers and the language just grew.\n\nThat is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences, and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential. Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language, the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area, for it's great universities and educational system.\n\nI am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group, that, with the local city hall of Araraquara, aims to transform the city into a national  technology, research and software producing center, accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids, diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses.

Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people.\n\nPersonally, I have seen only one \"installation art\". It was situated into a stand in Parque Del Retiro, in Madrid. It was built by two different elements. The first, placed in a corner of the stand, was made by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets. The second, in the centre of the stand, was a column made of coloured plastic baskets, surrounded by plastic bottles. The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash. Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile. Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art, and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape.\n\nDespite their beauty, new form of arts are very complicated to understand, especially compared to classical arts. An example could be the medieval art. Seeing a Da Vinci's portrait or a landscape painting, it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted. At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer, and the name of the piece helps  to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece. On the other hand, looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist.\n\nIn conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason, to communicate something. In every historic period, artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways. Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous, while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance. In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience.\n", "id": "1-36577", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "4488"}

I took cooking classes last year, so I can also work in the kitchens.\n\nI think it is very important for children to have fun in the summer camps. In the other hand, they should learn something new in the summer camp. And they need someone to help them and guide them through it all.\n\nKindest regards, Melissa\n", "id": "1-294043", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "39636"}

It might be hard, but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being.\nIn my opinion, journalists and paparazzi shouldn't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life. There are some borders that shouldn't be crossed. For example, when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative's illness, reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone.\nEven though they are well known, they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them.

I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation. \n\nFirst of all, as far as special friendships are concerned, I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily, consequently I do not have a large circle of friends. However, I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person. Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend. Throughout this friendship I have been given the support, the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams. On the other hand, friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and, naturally, I enjoy doing so. I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship. \n\nSecondly, I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort. A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart. For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants, simply because they are not the same people as they were before. As you gradually grow up your world expands, your personality changes and so do your acquaintances. However, the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school, getting our first job or changing the old one, travelling or moving to another city. All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones. \n\nTo summarize, I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it. \n\nYours faithfully,\nAllison Green\n", "id": "1-121148", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "18641"}

Most of the year I live in Pozna\u0144, because of my studies at the University, but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends. Last summer I decided to do something more than just relax and have fun, so I started to look for an interesting summer job. Like I previously said, K\u0119trzyn is a rather small town, so there is only one old movie theatre and it's closed for most the time. It opens only in a time of summer, mainly for tourists. Because of that, there are no regular employees, at the beginning of every summer new season stuff is hired. So I decided to give it a try and I applied for that job. \n\nIt was the best summer ever. You know how much I love watching movies, especially in small and cosy movie theatres. It was like working in a paradise. My duties were pretty simple. Selling tickets, snacks and drinks, cleaning the place after and before the shows, so work itself wasn't the exciting part. The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted. There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes, for family shows, there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show, for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks. I watched almost every shown movie, some of them for more than once. When my work there came to an end, I was happy, but on the other hand, I felt some kind of sadness too. I mean, it was September, so I had a one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax, sleep, read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones. On the other hand, I was sad to leave that job. This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere, regular visitors and people I worked with. I'm planning to work there for the next summer too. \n\nAs you can see, my summer was great. How about yours? I remember you were saying something about planning to go to India. How was the trip?

The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 right before Lent in a small, close-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and help them. However, Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juliette Binoche as Vianne, Alfred Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy, elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village, and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan. Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don\u2019t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 are a heritage from her Maya ancestors.\n\nIf I had to find a down side to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines. Had it not been written in the year 2000, but today, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters.\n\nAll in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues. A must-see if, like me, you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles, but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story.\n", "id": "1-302573", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "38406"}

Another advantage of cars is the fact that they are family friendly, meaning that people who use them don't have to worry about travelling with strangers who might be dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are not only expensive to purchase, they also require fuel, which is very expensive. Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport such as busses, trains or airplanes, depending on the distance. Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship. Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances, especially since they have become faster. Statistically speaking, car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents, so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes, but it's also safer and faster.\n\nAll in all, I believe that public transport will not disappear too soon.

Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts, graphics and paintings.\nFinally, you can do shopping on The New Square, a round trading hall.

Some parents would grasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him, whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet. In my view, I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets, especially in terms of their personality development.\n\nSpecifically, they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets. Take my cat, Luka, for example, I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old. My mother told me that you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat. Since that day, I started to take care of on my own. I took it to the hospital when it was sick, and bought it food when it needed to be fed. I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then. So, according to my personal experiences, I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet.\n\nSome people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time, instead of children themselves. Namely, parents always do things for children, such as housework, homework, even taking care of the pets for their children. Nevertheless, what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here. This does not suggest that children cannot learn from having a pet with them. Why children cannot learn is because of their parents, not because of the pets. In other words, taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity.\n\nMoreover, children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet, apart from leaning to be responsible. For instance, when Luka died when I was 20 years old, I was so sad and heart-broken as if one member was lost in our family. After that day, I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation. Thus, keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others\u2019 shoes.\n\nGiven upon my personal experiences, by taking care pets, children not only can learn to take responsibility, but also can learn to sympathize with others.

Nothing is more difficult than changing one's mindset given people's inertia.

Different activities, including  seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community. \n\n\nRecycling bins have been installed in every public housing estate and most housing estates, along with the road-side ones found in every district. Public Housing Estate Recycle Competitions have also been held every year to promote the concept of recycling plastic, paper or tin and to help the residents cultivate such a habit in daily life. We are glad that our work has started to bear fruits in recent years. We have seen a great drop in the number of solid waste. \n\nApart from keeping our city clean by reducing waste, we also dedicate ourselves to building a green city. Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools, community centres, etc. Eco-tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and, above all, to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature.\n\nWith concerted efforts, we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery.

We live in the mass consumption century, when it requires more and more time of our daily routines. For some this activity is a torture, for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time. But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?\n  First of all, shopping is unavoidable  as it is necessary to shop for food. It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery, probably according to individual needs. Most of consumers do not count time spent in food stores, as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping. Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods, but require more time, while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly. If you have a already made  shopping list, it saves your time and energy, so that you do not need to wander between rows in grocery store. When it comes to parties it is even more time consuming and irksome, than the ordinary one. Moreover, the most annoying is the last stage of buying goods - waiting in queues in order to pay. The queue you are standing in seems to be always the longest. Secondly, shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annual celebrations, or during seasonal sales. Hundreds gather there, parking spaces are full, again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds, it is the reality of nowadays. People become crazy, nervous or dull while shopping. Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home, it causes more tension and disimproves mood! Also,some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential, they are attracted by commercials, advertisements, sales assistant recommendations, so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything, as they are excited by the shopping process itself,it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards. Finally, it may be very fatigue, as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need. Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another place. On the other hand, the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions, without any rush, they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes, best quality garmets, stylish items. It comes as no surprise that women love shopping. \n  Although, shopping may be entertaining, it is still a time consuming and tiresome job. Being busy and spending time looking for clothes, presents, souvenirs, furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day. On the other hand, searching for your favourite brands, non-seasonal products, some special goods, just looking through shelves, trying the garmets on you, asking for consultations, testing products, there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase. This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it, after entering a colourful and attractive store. All in all, I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable by the vast majority. Fortunately, this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore, as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home. It is a perfect alternative to save time, money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall.", "id": "1-3591", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "582"}

She immediately ran to the doormat, ran back to the living room and showed me the envelope in her hands. I looked up as she opened the envelope.

This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time, so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work. Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem. This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food.\n\n\n      There are huge positive effects of eating fast food. First of all is convenience. People who have just done their work are very hungry; they cannot go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs, so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger. To make it clear, the bosses, who are always busy in their business, usually eat fast food, they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery. In addition, Junk food is very easy to be found out. There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere. Therefore, finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time.\n\n      On the other hand, eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer\u2019s health. Firstly, fast food is unhealthy. Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers. According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon. Furthermore, most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full. Finally is the loss of traditional meals. People prefer buying and eating fast food to making a healthy meal. As the consequence, they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone.  \n     In conclusion, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food. Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white-collar-worker, but it can also harm their health. The customer should be careful before they choose fast food to be a part of their daily diet.\n", "id": "1-25562", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "5389"}

Within 6 years, Facebook has reached  more than 1 billion users and still growing rapidly.\n    I wouldn't consider myself against it, although I am aware of the risks.\n    First of all, I think Facebook, for example, is a great way for shy people to socialize, because it can boost their self-esteem, considering the fact that they don't have to meet anyone face-to-face. It's also great if we want to manage our friendships, or create new ones. As a shy person, I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion.\n    Social networking sites also benefit those who have \"unusual\" hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests. For example, if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genders or series on social media, all you have to do is type in an interest.\n    On the other hand, we are also exposed to many risks, such as cyberbullying or online predators. While it can seem harmless, cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers, such as depression, suicidal thoughts or even worse.\n    Spending too much time on the internet also has harmful effects on our family lives, because we tend to forget how important it is to spend time with those who love us.\n    To conclude, although social media seems flawless, we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up.", "id": "1-98388", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "16363"}

Some people do manage to stay in the same place all their lives and even work for the same company, while others are much more mobile in terms of their jobs and homes.\nI feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies. In the past, it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives. There was simply no alternative to this, especially if you lived in an agricultural society. However, with the rise of industry and specialized companies, it became possible for workers to move jobs, often to places far away.\nFollowing on from this, as a society\u2019s wealth increased, people had skills and training to allow them to be much more selective about which employer they want to work for and choices about how and when they wanted to change the type of job they wished to do. We are, therefore, in a situation in many countries today where to be highly mobile is something\nthat people take for granted and regard as perfectly normal.\nWith the opportunity for change comes choice, although circumstances, economic and personal, can often force people to do what they might not normally choose. Therefore, it happens that some people want change in their lives but are not able to effect it. This might be because they have strong obligations to family, might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else. There are others, of course, who are quite happy to live and work in the same place all their lives because they do not think moving would enhance their lives. Some are happy to stay put because they would find it very stressful to endure change.\nIt is perhaps the majority nowadays who find change refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds out and the possibilities of getting on professionally and socially. For myself, I very much belong to this group.", "id": "1-82546", "cefr": "C2+", "userid": "14017"}

She also explained that they didn't know how the majority of people on the island got there, thereby not all of them spoke the same language, but they learned how to communicate with signs. They had a lot of things in common, they liked the same kind of music, the same kind of food and they both liked to read about fantasies and comics. Jacob told her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place but she still denied, until she accepted with only one condition, if all her family could go with them. Jacob told Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett's family, she was not happy about it but she said yes.

Some Pro-choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice, this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not. Contradicting the Pro-choice groups , Pro-life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable. Even though in some circumstances, such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies, it could be the best thing to do. Hence, every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice.\n\nAbortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies. The presence of a mother is important in a child\u2019s life especially in the first few months. During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops. The baby's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation, is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother's empathetic response. (Lier.l,1988)  This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child\u2019s development could be in this case negatively influenced. Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result. The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult-life. Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option. Besides, abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse.\n\nImpregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice. Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims, all areas of a victim\u2019s life is affected . Recovering is a hard and complicated  process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful.  In fact, this is the main reason why sexually assaulted victims choose to have an abortion. Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy, and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly. Even though, not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if, abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases, it is not a solutions for  accidental pregnancies. It is for  the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception.  Otherwise, you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy. In order to prevent this, it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option.\nAbortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies  or if the mother has been sexually molested. Undeterred by this, it still the mother\u2019s decision if she wants to save her own life or carry  and care for her rapist child.\n", "id": "1-50393", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "7944"}

As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain. Teachers shouldn't talk about their subjects without caring if their students are really listening to what they're saying or not, and they shouldn't let them study just because they must. They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience, as something their future is based on.\n\nSecondly,in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment. I agree with this recommendation because I think it's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year, offering always new materials and technologies, such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms, making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier.\n\nThis is what, in my opinion, must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate \"out-of-date\" system.", "id": "1-257462", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "36025"}

I was excited to get back into the classroom, I mainly teach online today, and try out some of my new skills on a group. I checked the equipment: I had a computer and projector, both in good working order, a fast internet connection and a full class.  I was ready and raring to go.....\n\nAs soon as the lights went out, the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise. One student said that she couldn't see well, another student complained that the writing was too small, another felt she was getting too hot from the projector. The group's native language is Amharit; they have all had to learn Hebrew, so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language.  I'd chosen a method of teaching that was not suitable for the group.  This is a group of beginners, the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough, without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods. So I switched off the projector, took out my white board pen, dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching.  \n\nWe've had three lessons so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group; it's a pleasure to teach face-to-face and a challenge to teach adults at this level; it's really great to get 'back to basics'.    This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room, it's not always appropriate and it's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods.\n\nInstead of creating some online lessons for this  wonderful group, I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class. \n\nThis post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense, it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets.

One of the most recent outstanding innovations is robotics. Lavine, Voss and Coontz (2007) define robotics as the combination of \u201cautomation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility\u201d which is \u201cbecoming more and more humanoid\u201d(p. 1083). The more computer science influences human\u2019s lives, the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering. Only a decade year ago, robotics was just limited to scientific research. However, today it is used in more fields, such as medical treatment, elderly-nursing and archaeological studies, as well as education. This essay will discuss the current social consequences of robotics in the area of education, and then conclude by commenting on its possible future implications.\n\nIn the first place, robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses, especially in scientific and medical ones. Tanzawa et al. (2012) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation. The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots, out of 98 candidates, only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses. From a survey, 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training, whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment. It is obvious that in this experiment, students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically.\nSecond, robotics can be taken advantage of to make studying and teaching effective and efficient. University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment, which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I-BLOCKS (a modular electronic building block system) could do on language tests. Surprisingly, the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not. Furthermore, the I-BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings, and build binary expression to calculate in real-time and show both final results and sub-results (Lund, Marti, & Palma, as cited in Nielsen & Lund, 2008 ). With the help of robotics, like I-BLOCKS, students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well.\n\nNevertheless, robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted. Suh et al. ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks. Two groups of participants were asked to do suture-tying task and a secondary task with distraction, such as decision-making, memory-task. They are Group A: ten medical students aged 19-27 who only had general knowledge about surgery, and Group B: four experienced surgical postgraduates. It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group. Moreover, in the task with distraction, experienced group was 1/3-1/2 faster in analyzing. Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics\u2019 help, uneasy operating requires much time. Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortage.   \n\nToday, more people not only in the field of education, but also in different fields, have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploring and studying. It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual\u2019s lives. Mordoch et al.(2012) made some examples of robotics in daily lives: social human-robot, social assistive robot, therapeutic robot, mental commitment robot, care robot, robot-therapy. To a country, robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars. However, there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers (Troop, 2012 ). Because of its unlimited potential, robotics will be used far more widely in the future. However, disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human\u2019s lives.\n\nIn conclusion, with technology and computer science developing, application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now. Besides influences on education, robotics has an effect on medical treatment, nursing and even design to future war as well. Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages, its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics.", "id": "1-65222", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "11485"}

INTRODUCTION \n\nThe aim of this paper is to show, through a transitivity analysis of the lyrics from three different songs, how language has influenced roles of gender\n\nThe questions we are going to answer about these songs are:\n\n\u2022 Although the performers are women, is the language used sexist? \n\n\u2022 Does anyone feel like a victim ?\n\n\nThe structure is divided in these sections:\n\n- Method: Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we\u2019ve chose them\n\n- Theoretical background- A review of our knowledge. We will explain some concepts that we will use later in our analysis.\n\n- Analysis: This part is the practical part that will answer our questions. The lyrics will be explained. Our tools will be transitivity analysis and language. Furthermore, we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs.\n\n\n- Conclusions: The questions we made before will be answered. With our analysis done, this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning\n\n- Bibliographical references: The part where the sources are revealed\n\n \n2.    METHOD: DATA SELECTION  \n\n\tWe are going to compare the lyrics from the following three songs: Miley Cyrus\u2019 Wrecking Ball; Anastasia\u2019s Left Outside Alone; and Taylor Swift\u2019s Back to December. We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking-up, but they describe this topic from different  points of view, even though the three songs are performed by female singers. \n\n These songs are relatively modern, but if we take a look we will find some sexism  in some parts. \n\n However, there\u2019s a hope for women to find a song that doesn\u2019t treat them like an inferior gender. This is the case of the \u201cfree choice\u201d song, Taylor Swift.\n\n Still, women are the victim in three different ways. We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret, made by some specific situations.\n\n Anastasia\u2019s song tells a story of a victim, meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men.\n \n Also, we think that these songs can represent different kinds of processes and language we have seen in class .\n\n\n\nThe material  processes are also known as the processes of doing. This is because they express an action or an activity. This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific. Usually, in these types of songs, the performers  describe actions in the relationships as well as at the  end of it. The material processes are carried out by agents, which coincide with the subject. The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate. We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject. In this category of processes, there is another participant known as the affected, because the action of the verb affects or concerns it.\n\nIn our research, the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones, which is quite normal when describing a love relationship \n\nSONG ANALYSIS:\n\nThe main participants are the woman and the man. The woman uses mental and material processes the same amount of times. Regarding mental processes, cognition is  the type more used.\n The material processes show  some actions that the girl would like to erase because them only make emotional abuse to the man . She feels sorry because she did not  care about him in this delicate situation. As we can see, the boy gave her love and she just want to leave him.\n Although the reason for the break-up is not totally clear, the girl is saying that it was all her fault. The boy did not do anything wrong.\n If we look to the boy processes, we will find only positive things. The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational (attributive type). These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man \n.\n On the other hand, the woman just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. The mental processes, specifically the cognition ones, tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong. \n The other participants appears a few times, but these participants tell us important  things about the relationship. She cares about him , about his life and his family (even though she didn\u2019t care before).\n Consequently, these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation, but actually they just confirm what the girl feels. She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it wasn\u2019t what she supposed it could be. She wants him, but \u201cthe chain is on his door\u201d. She broke up, but now she is on his hands. This can only be explained because he is a good boy and she was (probably ) confused.\n Although now she is sure, she had suffered a lot. \u201cThe cold\u201d and \u201cthe fear\u201d was inside her. She feels bad, but she doesn\u2019t really know what to say.\n Even though, there\u2019s a sentence that can confuse anyone. She says \u201cswallowing my pride\u201d. She has to do it, and is a sacrifice. Maybe she feels bad, but not completely guilty. This sentence shows a girl who thinks she is not really bad, though she knows she could have done things better.\n Obviously, she can\u2019t say a bad thing about him, but we don\u2019t really know what he thinks about her. There are some clues in sentences like \u201cYour guard is up\u201d or \u201cthe last time you saw me is still burning in the back of your mind\u201d. This means he still loves her, but at the same time he\u2019s still hurt. He is confusedly in love.\n Finally, the woman tells him that she would understand that he doesn\u2019t want to restart the relationship, but she makes a promise: \n\u201cIf we loved again, I swear I\u2019d love you right\u201d.\nThe problem is that maybe is too late and she only can wish \u201cI\u2019d realized what I had when you were mine\u201d. This sentence and some others sound like if they were  pronounced by a man\u2026\n", "id": "1-46871", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "9151"}

To speed up the learning process, you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn. I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you. In time, you will get to learn many new words. You also need to choose books of your favorite authors. This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand. Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you. However, you need to choose forums with eloquent speakers as it is the only way you will gain much.", "id": "5-1751585", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "5988db2d-4248-44c3-ab47-10f024cf8b50"}

They improve our health and help people interact with each other. Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities.\n\nThe chosen one\nIn my opini\u00f3n running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit, in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time. This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non-significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it.\n\nMinimal investment with huge benefits\nTo start running this community will need a few things. To begin with, it is important that the government develops a program which creates social awareness. A significant part of the population in this town do not know the importance of practising sports and having a healthier life. \nOnce people know all the benefits this sport has, they will need a space where to practice it comfortably. With  this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no-one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way.\n\nBenefit for all ages\nThere are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once. This activity not only improves your body and health but also helps you have positive thoughts making everyone feel happier.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n\nIn my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives.", "id": "1-275892", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "37958"}

However, the lecturer argues against the reading passage. The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading, while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage.\n    The first point, suggested by the lecturer, is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading. The cane toads' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers. Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way, the fence is useless. Thus, the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading.\n    The lecturer's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers. It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered. Because the young frogs look alike, it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads. In short, the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads.\n    Finally, it is argued in the listening passage that disease-causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster. The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America, it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem. To sum up, the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading.\n    To conclude, the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons. National fence, volunteers, and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem.", "id": "1-88063", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "14604"}

In most Latin American countries, millenary practices such as silversmithing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and quinoa, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors.  \n\nOn the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress. Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community.\n\nIn conclusion, traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations.

Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?\u201d\nIn recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally.\nCommunity service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new ones.\nWorking in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence. Limiting people\u2019s freedom because of minor, non-harmful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite its crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered \u201cdoing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development\u201d.\nCommunity service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison.

It  affects our lives in many ways, including our communication, self- expression, bullying, isolations, friendships, and even our very own sense of humanity.\n\nOn this networking site, users create pages that represent them in some way. They post pictures of themselves and their friends. Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults, they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online. It is more likely that adults would, use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves, their family, find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took.\n\nTeenagers, however, use this technology in a way that could be dangerous. In this stage of their lives, they care more about their need to impress their peers than mature reasoning. Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face \n\nAdults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks, specially Facebook.\nTeachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way.\nAt work, bosses may reduce employee\u00b4s salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks. \n", "id": "1-266658", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "36165"}

Aspects such as space, internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages.\n\nFirst, an inspection to the school\u00b4s facilities was organised, in order to assess the  school premises. From the visit, it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space, some of them wish  to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class.  Currently, each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process. It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes.  \n\nSecondly, It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room. Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers, the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills. Therefore, I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board. The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages.\n\nFinally, authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school\u00b4s library. It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language. Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts. Thus, I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school's library.\n\nConclusion.\n\nI strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention, the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced.

The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress, she has amazing friend and they have a band together.

I am a Dean\u2019s Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at XYZ University, currently revising the final chapter of my dissertation, and expecting to graduate in May 20XX. I am confident that my teaching experience and my research interests make me an ideal candidate for your open position.\nOver the past five years, I have taught a variety English courses. I have taught a number of American literature survey courses, as well as writing courses, including technical writing and first-year writing. I have extensive experience working with ESL students, as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities, including dyslexia and dysgraphia, and disabilities like ADD and ADHD. I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills. Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts, through a combination of individual conferences, class activities, and group discussion. I know I would thrive as a teacher in your college, due to your belief in small classroom size and individualized support for students.\nNot only does my teaching experience suit the needs of your school and department, but my research interests also fit perfectly with your description of the ideal candidate. My dissertation project, \u201cFerns and Leaves: Nineteenth-Century Female Authorial Space,\u201d examines the rise and development of American female authors in the 1840s and 1850s, with a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication. I argue that, rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher, female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed. I apply recent print-culture and book-history theory to my readings of novels, magazine articles, letters, and diary entries by various female authors, with a particularly focus on Sara Willis (known by her pseudonym Fanny Fern). I plan to develop my dissertation into a book manuscript, and continue to research the role of female writers in antebellum magazine culture, with a particular focus on the rise and influence of female magazine editors on literary culture.\nMy research interests have both shaped and been shaped by my recent teaching experiences. Last spring, I developed and taught a course on the history of print culture in America. I combined readings on theory and literature that addressed issues of print with visits to local historical museums and archives. My students conducted in-depth studies on particular texts (magazines, newspapers, novels) for their final papers. I believe my interdisciplinary teaching style, particularly my emphasis on material culture, would fit in well with the interdisciplinary nature of your English department.\nI am therefore confident that my teaching experience, my skill in working with ESL and LD students, and my research interests all make me an excellent candidate for the assistant professor of English position at ABC College. I have attached my curriculum vitae and the two requested sample publications. I would be happy to send you any additional materials such as letters of reference, teaching evaluations, and past and proposed course syllabi. I will be available to meet with you at either the MLA or C19 conference, or anywhere else at your convenience.

It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers, to the growth of the suburbs. Prior to the automobile, is the horse and wagon life, it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work. The growth of the suburbs changed the face of American society, bringing with it a whole different way of life. Moreover, it leads to an important expansion in commerce, resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls, department stores, serving as a powerful pull to tourism. \nWhat greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes, additionally, lies in various lifestyles. Being able to live far from one\u2019s workplace, people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip. It may be for a day, a week, or a period of time. In the urban city, the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry. We are beginning to see people in countries with cars going out of the city on weekends and holidays. \nThough being good enough, yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story. This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason: being an indispensable factor in many aspects. It is the key that supports many industrial fields, such as steel, machinery, plastic. The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well. Last but not least, the booming prosperity often parallels the numbers of job in the city. \nAlthough other forms of transportation may be more comfortable, none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the car.

Some people tend to think that their jobs have more effect on their happiness, while others seem to believe that their social life has more of an influence. In my opinion, my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience. As a result, I believe that my social life has more of an effect on my happiness. There are several reasons to support my position.\n\nFirst of all, family and friends whom we love always offer their support to comfort us. With the increasing competition in the workplace, people bear more and more stress. The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure. For example, every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me, and makes me breathless. Meanwhile, I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day from the work. However, I always can recover my energy after having a little nice chat with my family or friends. Therefore, the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work.\n\nIn addition, attending social activities widens my life\u2019s experiences wholesomely. Take my yoga class for example. Since I joined the yoga studio, I have made a lot of new friends. Besides yoga, most of them also have numerous other interests, like hiking, jogging, and baking. Meanwhile, they are friendly and willing to share their knowledge with me. Both learning new knowledge and making new friends make me feel delighted. Therefore, an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keep me in a good mood.\n\nLastly, some people may think that co-workers naturally melt into our social life since we spend so much time in the workplace. This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions. However, most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co-workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously. On the other hand, people are willing to discuss serious matters with their family and friends because of their shared bond of trust. For example, we talk about something trivial, such as gripes, and gossip, with our colleagues. Conversely, we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust. At the same time, we will also pay more attention to the people whom we love. Therefore, the more deeply our emotions interact, the more tremendously our happiness is influenced.\n\nIn conclusion, because of intimate support, growth in life experiences, and emotional interaction, I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation. In other words, even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co-workers, personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love. As a result, I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job.\n", "id": "1-61343", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "10999"}

Sometimes women go to the store, just to watch the new stuff, to look around and questions asked by sellers make us angry.\n\nIn addition, shopping is also a problem for men. It is said that the man, who go shopping more than one hour is angry and tired. Sometimes it is also a trouble for women, who want to go shopping with her partner.\n\nTo sum up, doing shopping is inevitable, so we can  make everyday shopping more enjoyable. For exapmle, we can take at least one family member with us. This is a great opportunity to spend some quality time together, exchange ideas and opinions; opt for evening shopping, specifically about half an hour before the stores close if you want to avoid big crowds; if possible, choose  only one store for your everyday shopping. Going from one store to another can waste your time, cost you a lot in gas, as well as mentally and physically exhaust you; when it comes to products that your regularly use, buying in bulk is the best option you have, since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home, without having to go out on a rainy day, deal with noisy (and sometimes  even smelly) crowds, spend money on gas and wait in huge lines.

The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits. Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from. There are many historical places in the Historical Peninsula such as mosques, churches and palaces. The most important ones are Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Sultanahmet Mosque, Suleymaniye Mosque, Yeni Mosque, the Grand Bazaar, Basilica Cistern, Beyazit Tower and the Spice Bazaar. In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them. Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537, converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul, now is being used as a museum. Topkapi Palace was built in 1470\u2032s and Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years. The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world and it has more than 4,000 shops. It is well known for its jewellery, pottery, spice, leather and carpet shops. Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul; size of 143 by 65 meters, with capacity of holding 80,000 cubical meters of water. Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University\u2019s main campus in Beyaz\u0131t Square. The Spice Bazaar is the second largest covered bazaar after the Grand Bazaar. It stands next to Yeni Mosque. You can find many types of spices, herbs, nuts, Turkish delight, etc. \n       Actually I was asked to recommend only one place, but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together.

However, with that being said, in my opinion, there is still a lot of future for public transport. I'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance. \nFirst of all, from a cost perspective, public transport is much cheaper compared to a car, especially when a cost reduction concept like 'car pooling' is not followed. The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none, especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work. \nIn addition, from a 'time savings' angle, increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights.\nFrom an environmental standpoint, use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high.", "id": "1-80863", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "13787"}

He only agrees to take over cases nobody else could solve and most of the time he succeeds. Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg, he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson, but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again.

The innovative aspect of \u2018House\u2019 is that he often takes illegal action, for example breaking into a patient\u2019s house to investigate environmental factors, which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it.\n\nI believe it well deserved such popularity, as apart from its scenario, it was on the whole qualitative.

It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health.\nDrama Club\nThis kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares' more enjoyable than solely studying them will. \nCookery classes \nCookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.\nDYI Classes\n\"Do it yourself\" classes improve practical skills. As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms, without their parents, they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves. The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. \nCitizenship classes\nAnother kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field. These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society.\nConclusion\nThe overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them. The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue.

As a result, in order to be sure that he could get the same love from mother like other children, his father married another woman. On the contrary ,the fact was inconsistent with what he expected. Lucky Wang\u2019s stepmother was such a snake-hearted woman that she did as many cruel things as she could to torture this poor boy. One day in an especially chilly winter, Lucky Wang\u2019s stepmother got sick suddenly. Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite, she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish. In desperation, he stepped to the river bank. Seeing the frozen water surface, he could do nothing but cry. As time flew, the sun sank little by little, which made Lucky Wang feel more and more helpless. So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice with weeping. It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him. Surprised and delighted, the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother. Moved by this little boy\u2019s filial devotion, his stepmother changed her attitude and started to love him from her deep heart. Ever since then, what filled this family is just happiness and love.\nAfter listening to the small story, some people were deeply moved by the happy ending, however, others thought it was unrealistic. No matter what the fact was, or even it never happened, the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety. Even if it was a fiction, the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved, which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time. Also, it was the governors\u2019 terminal purpose.

Finally, travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car. Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it, because you can save money.

Moreover, they often smoke and drink alcohol, which produces serious physical and mental diseases (CasaColumbia, 2007). Furthermore, teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary, since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports. \nNevertheless, governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past. For instance, in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions, where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano, 2012).\n\nLastly, everyone must understand that good health is above wealth.Parents and children should be informed about the use of drugs and junk food consumption, in order to raise awareness and improve their quality of life.\n", "id": "1-29612", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "6476"}

Without a doubt, long distance journeys are best carried out by plane. When considering the bus, users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible.\nAs I see it, drivers really appreciate the freedom of choosing their destination, the time to leave or to arrive, even the people to go with. If not, they would not make the investment of a car, pay its maintenance cost and fuel. Indeed, the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested.    \nMore and more, the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent. Moreover, considering pollution, private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision.

I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online so I decided to come check it out for myself. As I had arrived just as they open at 1pm, I had the whole place to myself. The majority of the space was taken up by a U shape marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made. Several lounge sofas were available on the side for big groups to sit together, but the view was what caught my eye as the floor-to-ceiling windows let in a vast amount of natural light. The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler. The decor was very simple and chic with abstract paintings hanging on the wall which would allude to the style of desserts being served here.\n\nI started chatting with the chef who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts. He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out. There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $108 to $138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $328. I couldn't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations. He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me!\n\nEach dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate. The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat. The salt brought out the sweetness of the watermelon while working as a balancing agent so the juice would not be too sweet. I was told that the drink/soup changes frequently depending on what would be suitable at the moment. \nBamboo Charcoal ($138) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life! It literally looked like a piece of abstract art painting. This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream, chocolate ice marshmallow, chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet. I didn't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal. The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy. My surprise favorite was the microwave sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute. He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing. It was very light and fluffy while still full of flavor!\n\nThe dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well. My tea was brought out with teapot and a small hourglass timer where I am supposed to wait 3 minutes before I should pour the tea. The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint-like and refreshing to drink. They also offered me some honey to add into my tea when I thought it wasn't flavorful enough at first.\nVerdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth! It would be perfect if they served alcohol as well and they told me that they are in talks with the building management to do so. The price wasn't cheap for dessert but if you take into the entire experience and compared to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge, it's pretty comparable actually. They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day so stay tune! I can't wait to go back and try all of their dessert flavors!\n", "id": "1-95077", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "13729"}

This report is an introductory document meant for students interested in the field of water treatment.\n\nSupply of potable water is perhaps the most important part of all municipal services. Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity. It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients, removal of metabolic waste, and body temperature regulation. People depend on water for cooking, drinking, and other domestic purposes. Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards. In all cases, the treatment process must fulfill both quality and efficient use of resources.\n\nCHAPTER 2\nHISTORY OF WATER TREATMENT\n2.1\tWATER TREATMENT IN THE PAST\nMithen\u2019s (2010) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport. Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood, the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors.\nGreek historian Diodorus Siculus, ca. 80-20 BC, wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather (1939), Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration, dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek. Since microbiology was yet studied, people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water. The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since, even nowadays. It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality.\n\n \nFigure 1 A qunat at the National Library of Iran, Tehran (http://media-1.boo.britainica.com/eb-media/72/987654-004-03E63A41.jpg)\nThe development of qunats (Figure 1) began about 2500 years ago in Iran, a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater. This ancient type of water supply system is still used in arid regions of the world. For example, in 1933 the capital city of Iran, Tehran, drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats, though with a lot more complications added into it. These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown. Unlike the past, where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene; with better scientific understanding and public education, people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day.\n\n2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\nThe history of water treatment continued in 1670, as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope. This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye (Figure 2).

There are no walls separating the foyer from the dining room or the kitchen from the guests. This being said, you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy. Sitting at any table you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food. Long wooden tables, which would be perfectly suitable for a class our size, are placed in the middle of the dining room. Assembled around those long tables, you will find the smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table.\n\nThe menu offers a wide range of mouth-watering thai-food dishes including starters, curries, noodles and desserts. Additionally, they offer a monthly alternating \"special menu\" card presenting five main courses. The food is always freshly prepared. The chefs take great care in selecting only the best quality food. They avoid using convenience food and any kind of artificial flavors. Definitely worth pointing out are the excellent fruit juices. Another aspect I would like to emphasise on is the service. The waiters go out of their ways'. They are courtous and industrious.\n\nThe restaurant offers good quality food for reasonable prices and the atmosphere is very welcoming.

He asserts that language choice and identity are not \u201cpredetermined\u201d and are prone to change (Lee 2014:  91); their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how \u201cinterlocutors interpret the identities being projected\u201d (ibid:  91). Therefore, context, including the participants, their social purpose, their means and channel of communication, plays a role in language choice and identity construction. Lee (2014:  92) refers to the \u201cforms of participation\" in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change \u201cthe way people think of themselves\u201d that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby. He refers to using nicknames, for example, as a way of self-expression that can shape the audience\u2019s mind and interpretation of writers\u2019 identity. \n\nLee (2014) defines three ways of self-presentations in most social media: (1) \u201conline profile\u201d (p. 97), that is the \u201centry point to social networking\u201d. In Boyed\u2019s terms, profile is an important space where writers tell the audience \"who they are and how they want to be seen\"; a link that connects people\u2019s \u201coffline and online identities\"(2008: 129).  Examining teens\u2019 identity construction in social media, he states that profile is where teens \u201cexpress salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret\u201d (2008: 129); (2) \u201ccontinuous status updating\u201d that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the \u201cfirst person\u201d point of view and (3) \u201cvisual representation\u201d that is \u201cvisual images\u201d (p. 98)(emphasized as in original).  \n\nContinuous updating, as a way of self-presentation, is one of the features of blog writing by which blog-writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience.  If the weblog-writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle, through using the first person pronoun, or tell their stories through the readers\u2019 eyes, by involving other grammatical subjects, is among the focuses of this study.  It seems that checking the Subject, as an interpersonal element in the clause, can provide evidence of my student-writers\u2019 self-presentation and involvement in the discourse constructed in their blogs. This is also relevant to the notion of stance and position or the existence of author in the text.\n", "id": "1-39527", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "8055"}

Speaking of which, it wasn't easy. Dealing with other people is the hardest part, escpecially when they're the same age as you. I think I did my best. \nAnother good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists. They came from different parts of the world. There were people from Russia, Germany, Brasil. That was really great to meet them and to talk with them. By the way, do you know Jess Morrow? She's a journalist from the New York Times. She's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show.\nBefore the concert started, me and my co-workers had to clean the stage, set up the equipment and make sure everything works well: the sound, the lightning and the instruments. \nHelping at this concert was a hard work but very inspiring. I'm glad that I had a chance to do it.\n\nBest wishes,\nXYZ", "id": "1-2290", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "314"}

First of all public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities. Our monthly fuel expenses can be reduced by using public transport to get to the workplace. Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport. Not always car is much more convenient, for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour. When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it's impossible. In my opinion nowadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity. Driving a car is also more tiring, driver must be concentrated all the time. Of course not always public transport is more convenient. When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals. Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable. With car we are more independent than with public transport.

The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised. Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website, connection issues and login problems, particularly correct credentials not working.\n\nWays to address the issues\n\nI think the website needs to be revamped to attract more users. The look and feel should follow the \"material design\" standards as they are defined by Google and should use more modern fonts. As for the server and database administrators, they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI would like to make the following recommendations:\nImplement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users, and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request.\nConduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features should the website include.\nDevelop a better feedback system so users can express their concerns and questions in a more detailed way.\n\nI assure you that if these recommendations are implemented, the website will improve significantly.\n", "id": "5-4359726", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "5b4a0d89-b3ec-4207-a78a-3b7649c57ad2"}

All over the world people of different ages are very fond of sport and games. Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities. Sport helps people to keep in good health.  Needless to say that sport plays a very important role in our life. It gives us much pleasure and many moments of joy. It\u2019s popular among young and old people. Many people do morning exercises, jog in the morning, train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms, and take part in sports competitions. Other people like sports too, but they only watch sports competitions, listen to sports news. They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events, but they don\u2019t go in for sports.\nThere are a lot of kinds of sports such as swimming, wrestling, cycling, box, football, hockey, track and field athletics and so on. There are summer and winter kinds of sports. The summer kinds of sports are, for example, swimming, athletics, football, volleyball, basketball and others. The winter kinds of sports are, for example, figure skating, skiing, ice hockey etc.\nAmong the popular sports in our country are football, basketball, swimming, volleyball, tennis, gymnastics, figure skating and others. You can choose a sport for any season and for any taste. I\u2019d like to describe some of them. In spring and summer many people prefer to go in for jogging. This is very popular sport and very useful for your health. You slow run and enjoy the beauty of nature around.  This kind of sport is getting more and more popular over the world. If you go to Europe you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging.\nSpeaking about sport I can\u2019t help saying about football, because this is very spectacular kind of sports. There are a lot of football teams, football events, and fan clubs in almost every country of the world. Some football players are world famous; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship. Football matches attract a lot of spectators, who come supporting their favorites. \nMany people today go in for extreme sports. Perhaps, they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting. It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality. There are different types of extreme sports, for example, rock climbing, rafting, scuba diving, surfing, snowboarding, parachuting, hang-gliding, bungee jumping etc. These activities usually involve speed, height and a good level of physical training. However, they become more and more popular even among the beginners. Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency. It also develops patience and self-control, and helps to control your fear. More importantly, it gives the sense of achievement. \nLet\u2019s consider some kinds of extreme sports. Take bungee jumping. You jump off a bridge and you fall and fall, and then, just before you hit the ground or water, an elastic rope pulls you back. In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to \u201csurf\u201d the air, doing gymnastics in mid-air! Winter sports have always an element of danger. For example snowboarding, which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow, is more dangerous even than skiing. Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy. You put on diving equipment and dive under a frozen lake. And, if that's not enough, you try to walk upside down on the ice!\nA lot of people are not fit nowadays. It's a big problem today. If you want to feel fit you'd better go in for one kind of sport or another. I think that everyone must do all to be healthy. Good health is better than the best medicine. To tell the truth I don't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life. In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives. In winter I go in for skating. If I have free time I go to the nearest skating-rink with my friends and we have much pleasure, skating together. This kind of sport is very elegant. You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully. I shouldn't call myself a sports fan. Of course, I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time, like swimming or running. I admire extreme kinds of sport. I think they are really cool. I admire people who dare to do such sports. \n", "id": "1-115073", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "1462"}

No one likes being \"unfamous\" and I don't like not being Lady Gaga's friend.\n\nIndeed, what I did in vacations was sleep the whole day, hang out with my \"Unfamous\" friends and write and compose two and a half songs.

My name's Vanesa, I'm 33 and I really enjoy watching soap operas. These days I watch a lot of different soap operas, though my favourite one is -and will always be- Friends. The plot is about six young people (they`re about 26): Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey & Phoebe. They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures, all of them related to their friendship.\n\nWhat could I say about the characters? Well, Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum, and he's Monica's older brother. Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan, she is Rachel's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend (she finally marries Chandler). Chandler is the funny guy and he works as a stock agent. Rachel has always been daddy's little girl but, when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera, she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe (though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years). Joey is... well, he's Joey: not so clever, a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler's best friend. And finally we have Phoebe, a veggie and bohemian girl who enjoys singing and playing the guitar and who works as a massage therapist.\n\nThe most interesting thing of 'Friends', in my opinion, is the love story between Ross and Rachel: the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her. This story continues until the end of the soap opera, when Ross and Rachel finally have a child (Emma). But there are a lot of funny stories, like Phoebe having  her stepbrother's children, or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor.\n\nI recommend 'Friends' to everyone.

I believe it\u2019s because, as humans, when we see someone happy, it makes us happy, especially if we are the reason for that happiness. The problem is choosing who to donate to. Is it the poor, homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa, or is it some cancer organizations? I choose none of the above.\n\tI've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money. In other words, they choose only from the most common causes. When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases, and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them, but who don\u2019t have enough money for research. I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they don\u2019t know about them?\n\tFirst thing I\u2019d do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet, and search Google for rare diseases. Then I\u2019ll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure. I\u2019ll be left with a lot to choose from, so I\u2019ll see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to.\n\tI have one of those unknown diseases, and I could easily donate to the doctors working on my illness, but I probably won\u2019t. I know that there are a lot of other people with diseases that are way harder than my own, and they need a cure much more than I do. This makes me realize that even if I have a disease, as hard as it is, I\u2019m still better than others and I\u2019m grateful. I\u2019m grateful I can bear my sickness and live with it, because others can\u2019t.\n\t    To sum up, I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations, to the ones who need more help. It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face. We should all be thankful we are what we are, because we could be a lot worse. \n", "id": "1-142069", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "21480"}

An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using. Also, this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care (Scoot, 2012).\nThe majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic, as Mr. Sharma, must recover in a PACU (Post Anaesthesia Care Unit) to monitor the vital signs, specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia, impeding any postoperative complication (Scoot, 2012; Farrell & Dempsey, 2011). \nThe first 24 hours of post surgery, is considered the most critical period, because the patient can present, primarily, lung disorders, and the nurse need to maintain the cardio-respiratory stability (Popov & Peniche, 2009). \nAddressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma`s admission on PACU, the first procedure that the nurse should do, is follow the A-G assessment protocol, to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient, sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Mr. Sharma\u2019s airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood (Pudner, 2010). Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position, but this position reduces his oxygenation (Snowball, 2012), and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect, where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward. Hence, he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction. \nTherefore, the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission, via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L/min, until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation be restored  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Thus, Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L/min, because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). To help in this issue, the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable, and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation, helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability (Snowball, 2012).\n", "id": "1-87365", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "14538"}

I realise walking is not considered a sport by everyone. I think it is a wrong way of thinking of sports. Therefore, I am going to explain the advantages of walking.\n\nI would like to start saying it is free. This could be seen as something minor, but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage. Secondly, I love its freedom; no pun intended. You can walk whenever and wherever you like. That is priceless. Thirdly, walking gives you a longer life expectancy. There are a lot of studies that prove this. Last but not least, you do not need any kind of special equipment or people. You can go walking alone and without shoes if you please.\n\nNevertheless, you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it. Therefore, I would like to share some things with you. You can start walking as you like, despite that, you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes. The reason is that, the longer you walk, the more you will feel what you are wearing. The second advice is you should try to find the best places to walk around you. The sightseeing is very important once you start walking. \n\nI hope I have convinced all of you to go walking.

When there are students with varied levels in English, it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course. Here are some of my solutions for this issue. First of all, determining the needs of the students is always the top priority. While conducting a need analysis, you can have a general picture of learners\u2019 motivation in learning English. After that, teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual\u2019s needs. Through teamwork, students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions. It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other. Differentiated instructions, giving different tasks for the same activity, are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students. Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty, or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels. Moreover, instead of using a core textbook, or using different levels of textbooks, carrying out a theme-based approach is more appropriate, and it also saves teachers\u2019 preparation time. Finally, preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students, so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged, while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning. \n", "id": "1-35070", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "7550"}

I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time. I think this problem is typical for almost all countries.\nIn clothes, youngsters prefer to wear famous fashion brands. Many people follow fashion designers.

Given the learning experiences in the past two year\u2019s school-based support, some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs, ELPS and Thinking Tools. All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1-4 school-based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum.  In view of these favourable conditions, higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS. The improvement of TSA results and internal results celebrated the success of teachers\u2019 efforts. More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS. \n\n5.2.\tSustaining capacity building through CLP\nGiven the experiences gained in the support services, many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS. The school could consider stepping up collaborative efforts in developing coherence in curriculum development. The CLP could be further adopted as a vehicle to identify the learning needs of students and to build capacity of teachers. More professional opportunities could be purposefully arranged to explore some effective strategies and promote discussion among teachers. Sharing among teachers could be encouraged to understand the learning of NCS. \n", "id": "1-83149", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "14088"}

The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that  give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans,unfortunately, there is no evidence of GMC\u2019s being completely safe for human consumption.\n\n It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports, leaving a cluster of questions without any answer. Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds,  encourage non-sustainable production models that promote the extinction of  independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era.\n\nAccording to an article published by UNAM in 2001, the introduction of GMC\u2019s has had a huge impact on the global market. The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security.\n\nThe usage of genetically modified crops has proven to be dangerous for humans as well as for the environment. In their quest for the perfect seed, genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity, as stand by a research led by Greenpeace, GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non-modified crops.\n\nConsequently, we must be careful with the decisions we make. It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have over our lives, but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them.

Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. \nThirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergy and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings.\nSo, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!", "id": "1-142357", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "21523"}

The river Danube divides Budapest into two parts. Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers. The island boasts fresh air and clear parks. Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location.\n\nTransportation system\nRegardless of the mode of transport, fares are very affordable. The transportation system is effective. The obsolete trams and trolleys had been replaced. The underground system can ease congestion. Bicycle trails can criss-cross the city. You can rent bikes.\n\nFacilities\n\n1.) Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators. It is suitable for 68976 people.\n2.) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport. This inexpensive hotel has 112 rooms.\n3.) Le Meridien is set in the city\u2019s fashionable business hub. The luxurious hotel has 218 rooms.\n\nCultural Life\n\nThe flourishing cultural life will fascinate visitors. The admission\u2019s tickets to the most of Budapest\u2019s museums are comparatively cheap. I recommend the Hungarian National Museum.\n\nObjections\n\nThe main concern is related to petty crime, especially the pickpocketing.\nIn addition, the homeless people have to sleep in the street. \n\nSuggestions\n\nOld historical buildings are in disrepair. The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people. The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime. In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships. Moreover, this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists.\n", "id": "1-26541", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "5544"}

While some people argue that bad human nature is the reason, it is undeniable that social problems and indigence are responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings.\nTo begin with, it is true that humans are often born with greed and selfishness. For example, it is not difficult to see the media talking about a son who kills his parents for money or a girl who is murdered by her boyfriend out of rage due to jealousy. These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to control themselves  at crucial times. Thus, bad natural personality can be the seed of crime.\nOn the other hand, I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality. It means that a number of law offenders cannot sustain their livelihood, and they desperately experience limited options to earn money. As a result, they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth, which leads to illegal  activities such as theft, kidnapping or drug trafficking. Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas. The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the city\u2019s life.\nIn addition, the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame. The effect of adult movies on the Internet can cause offence such as rape. Also, films and video games containing violent scenes can stimulate audiences to imitate those acts and commit crimes. This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality.\nIn conclusion, although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime, I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty.\n", "id": "1-155678", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "19818"}

Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players, others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model, just because they all do have something in common: they admire those people.\nFlattering is different, it is easier to recognize. If someone depends on you and s/he is constantly paying attention to you and being, in a colloquial way, a \u201cbrown nose\u201d, you notice and become aware of it quickly. Just because of their attitude and aptitude, their behaviour\u2026 simply in the way they act, we can see their intentions. \nNowadays, in some determinate cases, people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted, they flatter. And we can see these examples in many situations, when we find inept and incompetent workers. When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams, I think there are only two ways: influences or flattery; and to be honest I don\u2019t know what I prefer.\nTo sum up, I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation, to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be.\n", "id": "1-176099", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "25830"}

There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths, such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate, Judo , and so. These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages. \n\nthe First advantage of martial arts is to improve self-confidence. When you practise martial arts, you learn how to protect yourself against any sudden attack. You will get ready to fight with others, regardless their strengths, ages and so on. When you do a technique successfully on your opponent, you feel more confidence. Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others. Every time, you do a technique  you have to show your respect to opponent, and also  other ranks, regardless to their age. Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body; eyes, hands and legs. When you do a technique or defense against a technique, you control your body\u2019s movement and coordinate them to work in the same time.\n\nSome people think there are some disadvantages like injury, and getting aggressive. According to studies, martial arts have fewer injuries than other sports like soccer. People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy, and also to respect.  \n\nI suggest that everyone should try martial sports. But before starting, you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition. And when you are starting, follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques. In the other words, try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques.\n", "id": "1-347405", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "46002"}

You may want some nice music with you, so an Ipod is a handy solution to collect all your favourite songs and set up the perfect soundtrack to your walking activity.\nI would recommend 30 min per day, to get the most of this activity: it doesn't take too much of your spare time and you'll get great benefits from it.

I'm really happy that you are going to come to my country. Actually, now I'm staying in New Zealand, but I can give you some advice about travelling and working in Korea. \n I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people's way of thinking. So, I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa of Korea. If you have that visa, you can travel and also work. As you know, if you have normal tourism visa, you can't work. \n In Korea, we have many kinds of work which is related to English, so you can get a job easliy. Also, if you want to work more specific place such as electric company, public office and so on, you can apply to internship programme. If you get the intership, you can work as a real businessman. \n How long do you want to travel? Normally, summer is the best season for travelling. We have lots of beautiful beaches and mountains. In summer, you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking. Especially, I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island. It is the most popular place that people want to go. \n So, now I have to go back to work. If you want to know more information about Korea, let me know and I don't mind checking your plan to go Korea.\n\nAll the best,\n\nYeeun", "id": "1-83563", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "14123"}

Also, special ink is printed on both side of the sheet and the images are slightly raised. Then comes the most important stage -- inspection. In this step, workers are needed to manually inspect the quality of sheets and divide them into three groups: good quality, partially damaged quality and bad quality. Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones, which, together with good quality sheets, enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market, and bad ones, which go to disposal with bad quality sheets, where both groups get securely destroyed.\nThis leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple.", "id": "4-50863", "cefr": "C1.i"}

It's an activity that you need to do every day, now that it's a good way to keep fit. However, as far as I'm concerned, it's not necessary to work out that much to be healthy.

Besides, I don't think your parents would buy you a piano, since it would really annoy your neighbours.

Nevertheless, there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic. \n\nThe fist day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group. The tourist agency made group bookings, which resulted in the unusually low price of the holiday package. Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling, but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday, which made me and some others feel deceived. Another point of concern was transportation. We had several problems, especially with the bus, which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour.\n\nI believe there is plenty of room for improvement since, although the problems were not insuperable, they caused great inconvenience. Firstly, a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented. Secondly, advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them. But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization. Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls, for example waiting for half an hour in a  queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there.\n\nI assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me, but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously.\n\nBest Regards,", "id": "1-29238", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "6196"}

All the participants, which were ten in total, were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught. Furthermore, the organizers had carefully planned the whole course, including meals and beverages too.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe tutor, Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge, succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way. To begin with, he focused on design considerations with DPT, explaining what software to use, and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts, layout and balance as well as graphics and logs. Therefore, he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing. The highpoint, however, was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension. \n\nFAILURES\n\nDespite the strengths mentioned above, there were also some areas that required some attention. Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty. The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too, who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue. In addition, in spite of having paid a lot, the participants were not allowed to take any materials away, and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants didn\u2019t have any materials to use to revise. \n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTo sum up, the course was generally successful, as the positive feedback received suggests. In conclusion, we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor.

I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well-structured sentences now, which I couldn\u2019t do so well at the beginning of this school year. This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well.

A few examples are: from my point of view and it seems to me. \n\nSubsequently, I would like to answer the next two questions. Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process? Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year, I\u2019d like to improve my English vocabulary. As I see it, the bigger the vocabulary, the better the writing process. More words can be add in the article, so there can be a better explanation of the subject. It\u2019s my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process. I learned a lot of new words during the presentations, which I used in my free writing. \n\nTo finish, I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me, because it has improved my English very well. The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course, always can be used later on in life. For example, when there have to be sent letters in English.

They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment.\n\nIt is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes. This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid, miserable, hopeless and do not feel good about themselves. Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone. Even, in most cases, they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth. \n\nAll those people who are living this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone. There are many people who worry about and are willing to help and support them. There is always someone who you can count on in your family, friends or associations, but you must ask for help.\n", "id": "1-151895", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "21574"}

Furthermore, various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements, drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes.  Natural disasters such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far-reaching influence because its long duration and wide scope.  This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought, followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture.\n\nOne of the overt reasons for weather-related natural disasters is global warming.  It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions.  Moreover, the world\u2019s uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars, industries and farming industries, that have contributed to greenhouse gases.  With the cause of human activities, the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level.  van Aalst (2006) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century, with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ).  In addition, most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades, which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall.  Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting (van Aalst, 2006, p. 7).  Thus, it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon.    \n\nUndoubtedly, all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation.  Generally, the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days, and a drop of cold days.  This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation.  Additionally, this event is different depending on the areas.  The area as mid-continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation, which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts (van Aalst, 2006, p.8).  \u201cIt is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change\u201d, states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker, 2012, p. 20).  In brief, there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather.\n\nIn the economic aspect, drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture.  As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture, prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor.  The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output.  This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain, which can produce directly negative impacts for producers, as reported by Bauman, Goemans, Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013, p. 62).  Moreover, it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs: lives are lost, people and animals are forced to move to a new place, resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt, 2012, p. 148). \n\nAnother stricken area is social perspective, which has threatened the majority of the population.  Firstly, drought has caused farming in some of the area, such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency.  Moreover, farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather-related natural disasters, and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals.  Secondly, farming also has contributed to migration.  When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions, they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place, which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society.  Consequently, drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters.\n\nIn conclusion, catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts.  Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate-related natural disasters.  The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal\u2019s living environment bringing  about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise.  Additionally, climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home.  More seriously, climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters.  Thus, we should consider this kind of threat to our future.\n", "id": "1-111956", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "17721"}

I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older, and I know nothing will come out of it. So why bother loving someone who will never return that love back? To me, love is not about having two parties loving and embracing each other. Their life will be happier when you ceased to exist.

I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things. \n\nFirstly, I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes, especially for women. No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well. In addition, companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes. For instance, I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons. \n\nFurthermore, colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential. For example, psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people's appetite and makes them feel hungry. That is why the predominant colour in McDonald's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants. \n\nHaving said this, however, I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something. For example, if I liked a thing, I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it. Moreover, for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour. \n\nTo some up briefly, I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers' tastes and factors which influence their choice. Thus, we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors.", "id": "1-118661", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "18473"}

She had deep blue eyes and looked very shy. I instantly wanted to be her friend.\n   \nWe first met at the swings, she smiled and I knew we were going to be friends forever. I asked her if she wanted a sweet and timidly, she nodded. When the break was over we went hand in hand to our classroom. Gradually, we got to know each other and soon we became best friends. We played every day together and, in the afternoons, we went to each other's houses.\n  \nNow, we don't have any secrets between us and we always know when we need each other. I love how Jessie helps me with everything I need, like with guys or family problems. We love doing sleepovers, watch movies and going on holidays together. After many years, we still share the same kind of sweets we shared the first day we met. \n", "id": "1-219709", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "7244"}

A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television, not to miss a new cartoon nor a well-known film: they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries, news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of. It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems, in order to learn something more about the world we are living in. I am sure that, if taken up, this idea will surely be a failure. In view of the above arguments, I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily.

Without the routine that studying gives you, with all the dealines, the exams, and other stuff that forces you to get things done, and, by consequence, teaches you to be a responsible person, which you would need to be when you get a job, you will simple be wasting one year of your life  by taking a break.

Leaning forward slowly, I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill; I was on all four! I was feeling as tired as a worn out shoe. After a long and tiring crawl, I needed to find a shelter from where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated. I kept my body very close to the icy ground in order to reduce the impact of the bone-chiseling wind. Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just enough for me to lie down in. The place was a bit gloomy and cold but I had no choice; I was too tired to move on. But before I knew it I was asleep. I woke up to the sound of the howling wind once again, in a state of vertigo. Looking down at the watch on my wrist, I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament. I continued crawling on all four while wondering, for how much longer, Simon till we meet again. I never stopped praying all along; in hope that somehow, somewhere, someone would come along to rescue me. As I was climbing downhill, I found myself getting blisters on my palm in a manner I could have no control over. The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal! As quickly as I could, I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find where I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body. I was a broken man; barely alive! Emphatically I reminded myself that I shouldn't have survived had it not been for God's help! I kept praying to God to give me the inner strength to carry on although I was fully aware of my own self-imposed exile from church services the last two years. Doubts began to creep in, \"Would God show his mercy?\". With the pain, doubts, hunger all crashing down on me, I was about to give up my fight for ultimate survival. A second thought crossed my mind telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends! I had to carry on to fight to stay alive! The very thought of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant crowd disappeared all together and all I ever wanted was to be home, be safe, and be with my family.

Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals. Others say keeping animals in zoos is cruel and inhumane.\nOne advantage of zoos is that they give people the chance to see and learn about animals. This makes people more likely to want to look after animals and protect their natural habitats. Due to the interest in protecting animals, people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) which is an international non-governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment.\nAnother positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live. In addition, zoos help to find mates for endangered species. For example, many pandas would not find a mate to breed with if they were on their own in the wild.\nOn the other hand, there are many arguments against keeping animals in zoos. Firstly, zoo animals often suffer from stress and boredom when they are not in their natural habitat. Secondly, unwanted animals are sometimes sold to circuses, hunting parks or for meat. Consequently, they are mistreated, hit and live in an inadequate place where they cannot behave freely.\nAnother drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures, which is dangerous for humans. This is clearly seen when driving in the route and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the way. this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car.\nTo conclude, there are strong arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos. Personally, I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos, as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after.\n\n\n", "id": "1-315749", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "42205"}

This got me thinking, how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters? And is this always a good influence, or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of younger people?\n\nAdults can influence the behaviour of youngsters in different ways. First of all, they can give rules to younger people. This can differ from the rules your parents have set for you, to the laws created by the governmen. These rules can influence behaviour in a positive way, because they prevent you from doing stupid things. Secondly, adults can offer advice to the youngsters. This might be of great influence on youngster, for adults are seen as the wiser people. They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about. Lastly, adults can set an example for younger people. Think of celebrities for example. They are of great influence on younger people. When someone greatly admires a person, they will try to behave like them. So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters, they can influence behaviour in a positive way.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t all that great. Because young people often don\u2019t like to be belittled. So setting rules might cause them to do the exact opposite. Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules. Also, advice isn\u2019t always taken positively. This is because adults lived in a complete other time, so their advice might be outdated. This causes young people to ignore the advice. Lastly, when a wrong example is set, this can influence behaviour in a negative way, because they\u2019ll try to act to this wrong example. \n\nSo all in all, there are many ways in which adults can influence the behaviour of younger people. And whether this is taken positively, is completely up to the adults and youngsters themselves. \n\n", "id": "1-191240", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "27848"}

The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder. Although very important and critical, there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it. Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about \u201cFrozen shoulder\u201d.\n1-\tMost of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint, but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation. \n     \n2-\tIf you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition, then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time. Usually after major operations, having a stroke or bone fracture. They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation. So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness, movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time.\n\n3-\tAn important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed. The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol. In addition to this, physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement. Cortisone injections are also helpful, these injections can improve everything; decrease swelling, stiffness and pain. Surgery is our last resort if the condition is severe and all the previous lines of treatment failed.\n\n\n4-\tIf you believe that you can easily prevent frozen shoulder, then of course you are right. You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices:\n\n-\tIf you had a surgery or an injury, you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful.\n\n-\tHaving physical therapy after a surgery or trauma is crucial.

However, it is estimated that at least 70% of young kids do not take care of their personal rubbish and are the main contributors to a polluted environment. \nBesides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school, they are the most civilized and responsible. A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents.\n\nHow the town tries to keep the area clean\n\nAccording to our mayor, there are several points that our town really cares about to always keep our area as clean as possible. Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman's work every single day. \nAs far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine. This fine can reach between 100 and 150 euros.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude this report, there are many things that still need to be done. However, everything starts at the level of education that every human being receives. Unfortunately, there is still a long way to do in terms environment concerns, but some of this solutions suggested by the mayor help us stopping the pollution.

Also, planting more trees instead of cutting them to purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution.\n\nWhile there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention.

With  genetic engineering, human health has become better in many ways. For instance, it may be used by scientists to cure some diseases. Genes could be changed before a baby is born thus, inherited illnesses would no longer exist. It could also be possible to clone human organs so that we could have a chance to replace our damaged body parts. \n\nIn spite of the benefits, there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering.

This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety.\n\nFurthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.", "id": "1-212211", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "12811"}

The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students. \nThe survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire given to the male and female students to complete. It consisted of three parts. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with leisure time activities on holidays. The second section was concerned with time-out activities. The third part touched on the ways of spending free time at home.  \nFrom the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays, while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside. The male students would gladly go to historical places, while 57% of the girls who filled in the questionnaire weren\u2019t inclined to spend their free time in that way.  \nIn the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they don\u2019t spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera. 53% of the male students never do that; while 50% of the girls stated that they try to go theatres and operas several times a year to expand their horizons. The majority of the male and female respondents enjoy going to nightclubs in their spare time. For example, only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week. More than a half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two and more times a week. Unlike the boys the female respondents usually don\u2019t feel like going in for sport at leisure. In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time. While 53% of the boys never do that. Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema. For instance, 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week.  \nIn the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day. In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure. The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones. 40% of the girls read books several hours a day, while 13% of the male students don\u2019t read in their free time at all. The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet. For example, 53% of the female students are on-line more than 3 hours a day. \nIf any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are as follows. The leisure activities of the male and female students have a lot in common. There is an evident tendency to the decline in the active ways of spending free time. The young people of both sexes prefer to be on-line or playing computer games at leisure. According to the findings, it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places. There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones.\n", "id": "1-46956", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "9164"}

I strongly agree with the statement, that famous people also should have their own private lives, which no one's following and that no one knows about it. It is very hard to lead a normal life, when you have to think all day long, about what you say, what you wear and first of all, what you do. Being a celebrity means working all the time,you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work. On the other hand, it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives, but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life. In my opinion everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person.

So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War, fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass-media but also in the American society.\nAmerican press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc.\nThe tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991, while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea, a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow. The\u201dNew York Times\u201d made a series of publications dedicated to the coup. They were published under the common title \u201cSoviet crisis\u201d. The articles headlined \u201cSoviet crisis\u201d have broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia. On the August 20, \u201cNew York Times\u201d published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .\nThe American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society.

Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend the democracy. Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities. Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup\u2019s leaders. The coup, due to lack of organization and support by the military forces, failed three days after. The person of Boris Yeltsin has become the most popular one in that time world\u2019s press. Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president. American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand, also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him . The article of the New York Post \u201cTHE SOVIET CRISIS; Yeltsin's Remarks: A 'Reactionary Coup\u201d  refers to the night of 18-19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power. The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character. Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country. \u201cThe people of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny. The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited, and this includes party organs.\u201d \nThis coup had a big resonance among the American society; consequently the US mass-media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union. The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people\u2019s will. \u201cIn the hearts of many Americans, the cold war finally ended this week \u201d, the New York Times wrote. The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age. \nThe dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass-media. The reduction of Gorbachov\u2019s role and the growth of the Yeltsin\u2019s haven\u2019t been out of the attention in the US media sources. Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics. \u201cThe Communist Party, which has had control for 74 years, is rapidly dissolving  - the Chicago Tribune wrote.\nThe US mass-media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post \u201cSoviet Turmoil Shakes Europe's Communists \u201dtells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe. \nThe dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse. In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people. As a result, the Soviet Union has been disintegrated along traditional ethnic lines .\nThe upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence. The leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus formally announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec 8, 1991 and agreed to establish a \"Commonwealth of Independent States\" instead.\nThe official collapse of the Soviet Union has occurred in December 1991. On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned. The Washington Post has written down: \u201ca spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991. Soviet President Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of all Soviet agencies \u201d. Soviet \u00e9poque, which had existed for 74 years, came to its end and this paved the way for establishment of new independent republics. \n\n\n\u2003\n", "id": "1-57305", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "10338"}

What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be? Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world, according to Ethnologue. Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or  negotiating within the business market. Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would, without doubt, have many benefits.\n\nFirstly, as mentioned before, it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone. However, the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible. While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics, physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful. \n\tSuch a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third-world countries to start companies, trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty.\n\nMoreover, the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere. In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities. After all, a couple of professions might become extinct, for example translators, but, therefore, the organisation and execution of this big project would  provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost. \n\tThe educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings. In addition, civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership. \n\nHowever, this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses. On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible, for instance the aboriginal people. Anyway,, those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary.\n\tOn the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere. Nevertheless, English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well.", "id": "1-207850", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "29986"}

The future that lies ahead for public transport seems to be a bleak one. But is it really the case? Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come?\n\nI hold an opposite view; my answer is \"no\", for sure.\n\nWithout doubt, having our own car provides us with great convenience. However, we should not overlook the fact that not everyone can afford a car. Some people may argue that we can buy a second-hand car if we can't afford a brand new one. Yes, they are right in saying so and in fact, many people are second-hand car owners. But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair, and, of course, buying petroleum. The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those avoidable extra cost. Under this circumstance, some people may rather take public transport to save money for their \"dream house\" rather than buying a car. Not to mention that there are tourists in Hong Kong, who have no choice but to use public transport. It is clearly seen that there is still much room for survival for public transport. \n\nSecondly, even people have cars, they may also take public transport. As we all know, Hong Kong is famous for scarcity of land, there are not many parking spaces available, so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company are hence may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees of using the parking lot. Having scarce land is not the sole problem in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic, which implies the problem of traffic congestion. By taking MTR, one can save all the hassles of wasting precious time being stuck in a traffic jam. Besides saving time, taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans, e.g. global warming and ozone depletion, which raised people's environmental awareness. People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth. In this regard, they may take public transport instead of driving their own car even if they have one. Hence, contrary to many people perceive, there should be an increasing demand, i.e. a rosy future, for public transport. \n \nFrom the reasons mentioned above, it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line. But how about the future further far away? Maybe. Like our ancestors would have never imagined that we can now fly in the sky by plane. Technological advancement is, after all, always something that drops us a bombshell, so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go. Maybe one day we need no cars, or public transport. Simply by thinking of a specific location, we can go there in a split second. Who knows?\n", "id": "1-92507", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "15617"}

Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years, and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life.

Fast food has become part of everyday life. In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it, we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes. Not only is it an advantage for their health if they're able to create healthy meals, but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates, as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes. Moreover, it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine. \n\n However, there's still a more important area to have a good knowledge about \u2013 personal finance. Some families may be able to afford money and don't think about its value. Passing this attitude on to their children, they won't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably, which is a necessity in order to survive. Teachers can take up the role of the parents and giving them a knowledge about finances and the right way to handle it. \n\n To conclude, there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school. The two most useful, in my opinion, are cooking classes and personal finance. Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on, finances in particular. \n \n", "id": "1-30582", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "6827"}

Therefore, Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind: travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible.\n\nA few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels. He was following an important European summint on environmental issues. \nBrussels, Europe's capital, made his stay very pleasant. Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives. He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices. Access to sevreal public transport services (such as underground, buses, tram, etc.) let him reach his working meeting always on time. He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels' suburb. During winter Brussels might be quite cold.However,metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold.\n\nA few weeks later, Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle-East. He was so excited about that trip. Italy is his parents' country of origin and it was the first time for him to visit Italy. He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome. It was spring, the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy. Nevertheless, his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought. Jake's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes. He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy. Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars. Towns are congested by traffic jam, especially during rush hours. He was surprised by the poor quality of the air when walking around. The air was polluted by smog due to the huge number of cars. Jake could only move around by using the few expensive taxis available.\n\nSuch experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people's life and their surrouding. In particular, an efficient public transport impacts on:\nStress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam\nCommunications - it eases movements from place to place\nEnvironment - it reduces cars on the roads, therefore air is less polluted\nYour own and your community's pockets!? - access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community, in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel!\n", "id": "1-89438", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "14863"}

Although, I have been struck by its major draws such as Plaza De Espana, Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro, this is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me. Therefore, it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is difficult to feel deep emotions when it comes to living in a place without real social contact. Therefore, I miss my close-knit family and friends. I\u2019m having a very nice time in Seville though. In fact, the more I know about its organization and its people, the more I feel at ease in Seville. It is almost as if I were at home now. I must well admit this has not always been so. To be honest, I was not very attracted by the spirit of the city at the very beginning of my stay. In my opinion, Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude. Consequently, what are the reasons of my change of heart?\n\nIn my view, getting to know a city is quite similar to getting to know people. The more I understand it the more I like it. Of course, it may happen at times that I dislike what I discover! Luckily, this has not been the case so when it comes to Seville. This is partly due to the fact I have picked up a few words which enable me to interact more easily with its citizens. For example, people start to talk with me when they notice I make efforts to speak in their language. There are even some smiles and laughs, which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, Seville is bright, colourful and lively which cheers me up and relaxes me. For instance, I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid-back atmosphere. I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly. Needless to say, I greatly enjoyed this time as it made me feel as if I were part of their life and of the place. To make matters even better, there was some music played a few meters ahead, which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there.\n \nIn addition to this, I really like sharing tapas dishes with people, drinking a good fresh \u201cdraft beer\u201d and going for a \u201ctapas crawl\u201d with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a \u201cpub crawl\u201d.\n\nI am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures. Some of these are striking secluded places such churches or Moorish-styled houses. Thus, scouring Seville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in the past. \n  \nOn account of all this, it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time.

It is a sport that develops no only the body, but also the mind and the heart.\n\nIf you want to try it, you should find a club near you.

However, there are two kinds of vacation, a real vacation and a dream vacation.\n  One summer vacation, I went on a trip to Paris with my family. It was a 10-day trip. And we had booked all our hotels in advance. It seemed to be a dream vacation. But it turned out to be totally different when I arrived there. It was in the afternoon when we arrived. When I walked out the airport, I was attracted by the beautiful scenery. The streets, the caf\u00e9s and the people formed a beautiful picture. At night, I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant. But no, instead of sitting in a restaurant, my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner. In the next following days, we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals. And we had only water when we were thirsty. During these 10 days, we walked a lot instead of catching a bus, because it saved money too. But it made my legs sore every night. This is kind of the real vacation for me. Even though I was in a romantic city, I couldn't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had. \n  To me, a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau, where I can enjoy the sunshine and the sea. And I would like to go there with my boyfriend. When I am there, I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed. After, I would head to the sandy beach and relax in the sun, feeling the breeze. As the day goes on, I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea, go snorkeling or just lie on the beach. Lying on the beach is very relaxing and it is the perfect thing to do on vacation. Once the sun goes down, I would hit the bars to have some drinks and enjoy the nightlife. And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants. This is the kind of dream vacation I want so bad. Vacations should be relaxing, not tiring.\n  There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation. And it is all on account of the budgets we have. Once I have enough money, I will have my dream vacations come true.

Despite the rise of social media, the idea of community has changed radically, because people are sharing interests everywhere on the planet. Social Media such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them. This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life, emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter. Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy.\n\nSocial networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi-public profile, arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system. Namen and Kinnison (2012) indicates that \u201cthe three types of social interactions that social networking enables include (1) creaction of an online identity, (2) establishment of relationships between users, and (3) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes\u201d. One of the most popular social networking websites is Facebook. Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter. These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers. By Twitter, users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters. On the other hand, on Facebook people can share pictures, v\u00eddeos and thoughts without restrictions.\n\nAs a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education, Javanovic, Chiong and Weise (2012) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes, like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources (p.39). Furthermore, some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a v\u00eddeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication. Additionally, a politician from Philadelphia, USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign.", "id": "1-52820", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "7833"}

My ex-husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment.\nDuring our dating he was very charming and attentive. We discussed about some sexist ideas that I don't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him, but I was fine with that because That can happen, but due to my profession he couldn't be like that for so long because I was in a man's shoes. He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed.\nI learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman, he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it.\nI also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day. For example, while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours, just whith a blank mind. But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about.\nI also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honor man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not. A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs. Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes. They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone.", "id": "1-114736", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "18069"}

He was accused of mistreating his wife and that is the reason why they had been separated for  the last eight months. The problem is that he has an obsession: he wants  to get back with his wife although  he can't talk to her as the police have forbidden him.  His neighbour is a young woman ( Jennifer Lawrence) who has been widowed for 2 years. She has  a turbulent and complicated past. They meet   by chance and started a  tortuous relationship  as  friends.

About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk, whereas the rest would be interested in R&B, soul and jazz.\nTelevision\nAlthough not many young people like spending their free time watching TV, I believe that some patterns of preference can still be recognized. Except classics like Friends, popular shows include How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight. I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no more in with young people in my country.\nClothes\nMost teens tend to create their unique style, often managing to start a fashion of their own. Designer clothes are not what they look for anymore. \nConclusion\nThis information can help the organizers of next year's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes.", "id": "1-344507", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "45573"}

The way self-sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves, because it's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism. What is more, we are becoming indifferent to other people's suffering and that's why we aren't willing to think about it, even on Good Friday. Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we don't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows.  \n3.

It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day, but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa.

I firmly believe that were the schools to offer kids a greater variety of sports, there can be no doubt that they would do more exercise. In this way, children could do the sport they prefer as a routine.\n\nTo sum up, it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise. School programmes and technology could be effective methods to achieve this goal.

I was 9 years old when it happened for the first time. Back in the time, when I successfully passed the third grade, my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward. The very first thing came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates; I used to look out of my window, or sitting on my house\u2019s door step and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps, and all I wanted was joining them instead of watching them enjoying their times. My parents took me to TOYS R US to get what I wanted. I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skate I liked. I tried couple of sizes to see which one fits more. I could not be more excited to join my friends. After that, I went back home, I put them on, and I went outside to skate. I fell over a hundred times in a few days. By the time, I got better, and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items. While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning, I found myself in it. I knew that skating is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life, the thing I want to tell people about when they ask me what your favorite thing to do is. \n        In a couple of years, I became much better and I learned to do many tricks like skating backwards, the Snake and the Zigzag. I learned how to jump over many items, such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over. However, that was not enough for me. I kept trying to know more about skating. I entered middle school; I met two friends who also love to skate, Mohammed and Khalid. We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park, which has a wide walk path by the sea. When we met on the weekend, I noticed that they were different; they have different skates, and different methods of skating, they slid on edges and skated on the park benches. I realized that this is what I am looking for, a new additional excitement to add to skating. I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates, but this time it is aggressive skates. \n       When I started aggressive skating, I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two-wheel inline skates. This kind of skating taught me how to take risks and not to be afraid. After a while, the group expanded, and we used to go around the town, Yanbu, to search for great edges and rails to slide on. In addition, we made our own skate rails, and we used some help from my friend\u2019s brother, who is in fact an Engineer. \n        Once on a weekend, it was my last year in middle school, I was at the park practicing as usual. I found three people skating, and again, a new kind of skates, and new methods. Their moves were so smooth; it was more like a ballet. I was impressed. I introduced myself, and as I thought, they were vising from a different city. We discussed different topics, but mainly skating. The more we get deep into the conversation, the more I want to learn this type of skating. It turned out that they were wearing roller hockey skates. \u201cThese skates are light, smooth, and perfect for freestyle slalom skating.\u201d One of them said. The words \u201cfreestyle\u201d and \u201cslalom\u201d caught my attention. They showed me what slalom skating is. They started to put small cones in one line with a bit of space in between. They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm. I was surprised, I had mixed feeling, and it was indescribable. I kept staring at them with wide opened mouth and eyes. The butterfly feeling in my stomach started to appear. I knew at that moment that I want to change my style of skating. \n\n        However, as the skaters suggested, I bought a pair of hockey skates. I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then, therefore, I went to IKEA, and bought small colored cups and used it as cones. I went to the same park. After couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates, I put the cups on. I opened some tutorial videos on YouTube and started to practise. In a short time, I became so good, and some of my friends changed from aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing. My guess is they had the same reaction I had when I saw the three skaters. \n       For me, skating is not just a sport. After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks, to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing, and to try to reach the perfection, I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport. A freestyle skater who can make a perfect combo of tricks that matches the rhythm is an artist. When I stopped looking for enthusiasm, fun, and excitement and started trying to fulfill my heart, brain, and body\u2019s desires by skating, I knew for sure skating is not just a sport or a hobby. Skating is a lifestyle. \n     About one year ago, I moved to Philadelphia, United States. Unlike weather in my country, Philadelphia is always rainy, wet, and sloppy. This weather was an obstacle, it was impossible to skate in this condition. However, I was not going to give up on skating that easy. I had to find something to keep me going, to fulfill the missing part in me. A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot, and for me, everything worth trying just to be able to skate again. I went to an ice rink, I rented hockey skates, and I started to skate. I did not imagine that it would be that similar to roller skating. What I learned in 10 years, I had the ability to learn it on ice in one month. It was just a matter of balance. \n     Today, After 10 years of skating, I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating. I believe that skating is a huge part of me, Mohammed, and I am positive that if this part was missing, my path in life would have changed and I will never be the same person I am now. \n", "id": "1-236839", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "31300"}

Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer's behavior in a commercial aspect. But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art.\n\nFirstly, art is the expression of  human creative skills and imagination, typically in a visual form. And advertising is a combination of sounds, images and words. Like art it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings. To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies, catchy melodies, unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings. Often people, who are watching a commercial, do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before. Therefore, advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior.\n\nSecondly, art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives. Someone designed all things around: a chair, shoes, clothes. It is art. Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people\u2019s eyes. Hoardings and billboards, which are a part of the urban landscape, are art. Visual advertising like painting uses color, value, space and line. There are elements of art. Also it uses balance, contrast, emphasis and proportion. There are principles of design.\n\nLastly, advertising like art originated a long time ago. Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece. There were posters for entertainment, small ads for businesses, merchants used town criers, paying for events. With the development of mass media, television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication. Now advertising is a big part of modern culture. \n\nAdvertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful. Advertising is creative combinations of sounds, images and words.

The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and it is the main idea of the article. The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by. Writing the play: first, you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters; second, learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story.\nThey you should take a decision of choosing roles: start by asking for volunteers; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do. Students must learn their lines by heart. The most effecnive way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end. You can give them the play with gaps to read through and finally get them to perform a number of times without a script. Some learners will not want a spiaking part, you can even ask them to be promters. Reasons for doing a play: learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts.

Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles, in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions. These conditions fall into three broad categories: attitudinal, financial and logistical.\nFrom an attitudinal perspective, people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation. An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before. People should be familiarized with the environmental, social and personal benefits for present and future generations. This is one step.\nFrom a financial perspective, public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers. In other words, it must be more affordable than driving to work every day. For example, if people know that by using bus and subway, they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year, many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way. This is another critical step.\nFrom a logistical perspective, public transportation should be convenient for commuters. City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen. For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway, they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time. Transport vehicles must be well maintained, subway and bus drivers should be customer-oriented and service must be punctual and efficient. This is an additional important step.\nIn conclusion, through a multi-pronged approach, it is possible to increase the use of public transportation. City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example. Then, more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner, less polluted environment.", "id": "1-65989", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "7593"}

In a few sentences we can get an idea of what it is. And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events.\n\nI think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things: animals, betting and fashion. If you like animals you'll ejoy seeing that beautiful horses running and vaulting as fast as they can.\nIf you like to bet and you're not used to doing at horse races, maybe you're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way.\nAnd if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot, you may run into the Queen and greet her, and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear. Meanwhile you can have a good time drinking some bubbly.\n\nBut you can also have a \"horrible\" day at the races: if  you're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets, you can end up skint, penniless. And of course, if you're not an it-girl, you can spend a lot of money and choose a wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you'll have to view the races from behind a curtain.\n\nAnyway, if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it wouldn't be so thrilling. That's the raison d'\u00eatre of horse racing: lose or win money.

Because two days ago I\u00b4ve read an article, by Nadine B\u00f6s, about this topic. The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries.\nAt first you have to know that the technical term for this is \"mobile banking\". Today it is fact that there is a target group for mobile banking: people who are living in remote areas of the world. On the one hand there are hardly any banks in these regions, so they don\u00b4t have access to bank services. But on the other hand the number of mobile phones has risen. So now the most important factor is that mobile nets are reaching the remotest areas in the world. Through this many people would have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money available so it can be used in shops. According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants con use mobile banking to send money home.\n\nI hope I could help you with this information.

Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .\nHowever, there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium. \nFirst of all, the mobile phone is a great way to \"stay connected\" all the time. Chatting with your friends, staying informed of the latest news, ordering online, etc - you can do all these things simultaneously, wherever and whenever you want. This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done. Furthermore mobile phones allow last-minute-changes very easily. No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance, as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way.\nHowever, the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion: being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people, as you are always available for everyone. Therefore you don't have any time to relax, which is essential, even from your leisure duties. The same is valid for business life: if employees are available all the time, they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress. Last but not least, the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently. This can be seen as loving worry about someone but also as a sign of distrust. \nFinally,  the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life. However, I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably, according to one's personal needs.

At the beginning of this course, as a first year postgraduate student, I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course.\n\nEight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design. Before taking part in this course, my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured, durable and financial reliable. My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks.\n\nBy attending the first three lectures, I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products. I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products. It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process, improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product. This is because despite having experience in industrial design, I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage. Therefore, my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited. \n\nBeing placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard, I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome. The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients. This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes, client interview task and client feedback (which is worth 25 points in the total mark). As soon as I met my group, I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members. However, this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week, whose English is their first language, to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion. Because in order to deliver a successful industry project, I not only have to make a good product, but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers. The final consideration is the self-calibration, which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process. This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance, keep pace with the group and not to be left behind.\n\nTo sum up, at the end of week three, my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process, to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation, to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill.

Due to the increasing population of the world, countries are likely to need more fresh water to irrigate crops to satisfy their population. Therefore, water scarcity may pose a threat to people\u2019s living standards. This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions. It will examine responses including the recycling water, the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources.\n\nRecycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem. This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people\u2019s daily life, they just need to be collected to filter waste parts. However, the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common, because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains. For example, those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden, but if they are clear enough, residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink. Thus, states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level.\n\nMoreover, developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy. As is well known, about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water, so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need. Although, governments are likely to face economic stress initially, which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education, infrastructure and medical care, this strategy could affect dwellers\u2019 physical health and promote their living standard.\n\nSharing different water resources with neighbouring countries can be another strategy which can help to alleviate the problem of water scarcity. Countries with abundant resources can give assistance to nations with water scarcity. In this way, those states of drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems. Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension, few countries suffered these problems.\n\nIn conclusion, water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment. This essay has discussed three alleviation strategies with the potential to resolve the problem of water scarcity, including the use of recycled water and ocean water and international aid. While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially, they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term.\n", "id": "1-125503", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "16403"}

The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal. Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors,  whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting. Besides, camera work, props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features, while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy.\nIt is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another. But let\u2019s take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting. The stage actor is armed with props, costumes and light as well as the film actor. The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera/editing work and special effects. But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors. So I would say those types of acting are even in the sense of external factors.\nRegarding acting techniques, stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors. The only thing that differs is that film actor has several takes opposed to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash. And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors, in spite of having the support of audio operators, they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting, resonate moving, communicate emotions and feelings of their model character.\nThe key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect. I would say, it doesn\u2019t matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera, you should use your facial expression, body language, intonation and timber of voice as if you\u2019re acting as your main character, embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation.

However the first article was more motivating to read, because the author substantiated important suggestions. All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention.\nFirstly, the article \u2018predicting dyslexia \u2013 even before children learn to read\u2019  shows a new research,  in which it\u2019s possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read.

Most importantly, this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome  their educational failure . \nSecondly , the article \u2018'Innovative' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism\u2019  is based on a video-therapy, which improves the interaction between parents and autism-related babies in a way that would help develop the children\u2019s communication abilities and social engagement. In my opinion, the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video-based therapy as a potential treatment. What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea, but needs more attention to improve their success.\nAll in all, if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals, I recommend reading  \u2018predicting dyslexia \u2013 even before children learn to read\u2019.\n", "id": "1-300929", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "40396"}

My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them. Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional. Maybe they are, like myself, a bit in over their heads.\n\nBut the whole experience brought a positive surprise: working at the same school as Nora does is actually pretty nice. While we might talk about our job a bit too much I don\u00b4t think it is uncomfortable to work side by side.\n\nAnyhow. I finally connected with some people. I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network, of these the live roleplay looks promising. It is a steampunk story and I am supposed to be part of a secret society that is trying to stop an evil cult. It will be awesome!\n\nLastly I hope next year will bring some stability. While I do not wish top continue to work and live like this, I am not sure I want to move again. Moving is always upsetting and there is a period of adjustment that is very stressful. And a new workplace is difficult to adjust to and there is no promise that it will be better than the last. But I can\u00b4t imagine in can be as bad or worse then my current job.\n\nA thing I would miss is the connections I started forging with other people. If I move again I know it would take another year to find other people at least. Chances are that I won\u00b4t meet any other people because Visby at least has a few nerds that you can hook up with. I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of clientel.\n\nSo in conclusion I would like to say: the future is unknown.

I hope you're doing well. Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today. I was so excited about going to London and seeing you again. But only until yesterday! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th. As you know I'm not the best student and I've already failed in this exam twice, so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester. Otherwise I will be taken off the university register. To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight.\n\nYou don't know how ashamed I feel now, not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets (and I can imagine how difficult it must have been) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. \n\nDo you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we can't go together? I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it isn't with me. I'm sure it will be lots of fun going there! Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany. The band is not so well known here and the ticket sale hasn't started yet.\n\nSorry again for all those circumstances!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nClaudia", "id": "1-311891", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "6116"}

In 2002, I was ranked 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State. At this period, I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court. At the law office, I supervised the ISO 8003 procedures. On the other side, in recognition to my academic performance, I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007. I was placed in the top 10 with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10. My bachelor thesis, founded in Economic Law, was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10. This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade, that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain. \n\nSince my Law school graduation, many achievements encouraged my professional development. First, upon graduation, I immediately joined a highly recognized firm, performing a double role of legal consultant and sub-manager, when I was only 22 years old. On the same year, I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10. After almost 2 years working in complex litigation, I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within  and cross-border contracts. Therefore, in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded, I specialized in Economic law with a master\u2019s degree at the University Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne in 2009.   \n\nFollowing my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five, I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010. Due to my interest in law and economics, I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions. I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career, which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences. Thereby, new regulatory sources are created in response to the globalized legal context. In conclusion, as an international legal professional, I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross-border transactions, giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions. \n \nFurthermore, I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher. Henceforth, I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the legal responses to the developments shaping international trade today. The LLM in International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed.\n", "id": "1-120554", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "18746"}

The movie \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d displays a variety of situations from Afro-American people who suffered because of their skin color, known as racism, which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another.  In this period of time, the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro-Americans, they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity, while the Afro- Americans did the hard work; as shown in the movie, most of the men where in charge of the crops. They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all, it was absolutely forbidden, and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs.\nAfro-Americans were completely segregated, Caucasians found it impossible to live among them, that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to.\nAfro-Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering, and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished.\nMoreover, women in the Afro-American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways, men were the undisputed authority in the house. Women were in charge of the household chores, some of them could get a job as a servant of a Caucasian family.\nIt makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers. I wonder, Why do we have the necessity of feeling superior to other people?

Many people would disagree, but our future depends on public transport.\nFirst of all, our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars. Since cars produce exhaust fumes which slowly destroy our planet, we should start using public transport more often. Although there are many other polluters, such as big industries, people should start with the easiest resolutions.\nAlthough many countries do not offer a good public transport service, once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements. For instance, Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this.  It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future. As more money is being invested in the infrastructure, people tend to use more bikes and public transport.\nUnfortunately, not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides. For example, it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious. Moreover, it is faster to travel by car than by any other public transport - planes are an exception to this rule.\nIn conclusion, I think that public transport should win this battle.

I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students. I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons. \nI live in the Netherlands and at our school it\u2019s the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn\u2019t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can\u2019t be quiet and can\u2019t sit without making a move. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself by sitting all day.\nYour key takeaway #3 was shocking for me, the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful. In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and , as I see it, it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand. \nYour experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active. I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films. For example, my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying: this door, that window, this is my teacher, that is a chair.                                                                            \nHowever, I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming. Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues. I don\u2019t see them doing activities, it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it. For instance, when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4  I feel incompetently. It gives me the feeling that most important of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done. Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results. In other words, how can we convince school board and colleagues that it is better for pupils to learn in an active way?\n", "id": "1-354464", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "46772"}

MUx/Px must equal MUy/Py. If MUx/Px is less than MUy/Py, than it is the consumer\u2019s duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy/Py is less than MUx/Px, than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more, you can consume more, each additional unit yielding additional, marginal utility, so you continually increase the sum of your total utility. Following the tradition of economic reasoning, more is better. She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption, but theory would indicate that this is a positive, self-perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility, therefore maximizing utility.\nThe book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming. Ms. Luhr\u2019s dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods. For goods, the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while, and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods. Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her. Then she wouldn\u2019t be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility. Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes.\nIn my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility, and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act. If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self-interested, she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption, but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning. She doesn\u2019t want more. She must be irrational.\n\n   \n\n", "id": "1-144921", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "1579"}

However, there are some defficiencies that could be fixed. Firstly, there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection. It is well known that this kind of facility help students make the most of their time while learning English. Secondly, we are in need of a conference room. This will be useful to practise both speaking and listening skills. Finally, it is also recommended to update the books in the library: most of them are quite old and outdated.\n\nACCOMMODATION\n\nOne surprising outcome from the survey was that students do not feel comfortable enough in the residential building. Not only the bedrooms are rather small, but also are they quite cold, because of the lack of a heating system. This is a great problem during the winter: almost every student has suffered from illnesses during that time of the year. There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen. It will be advisable to change the catering service.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe will be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee.

Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree. They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion. In my opinion classes with discussion are better.\nFirst, classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student. Doubtlessly, such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things. This will enrich your personality. For instance, a year back I was in north Texas university in USA, there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions. In the beginning, I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true. On one day we spoke about medical treatment cost in different country and one of my friend, Wole was from Nigeria. Consequently, he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less, how doctors are dedicated, and how everybody has access to primary health care. As a result we all know what to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to lessen the cost of the treatment. As you can see, open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation\u2019s policies.\nSecond, open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker. It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career. For instance, I was really afraid of speaking in front of many people. However, this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others. In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in   discussion. As a result I overcome my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found its not difficult as I expected. This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career.\nAll in all though some may oppose my opinion, it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become  a better speaker and thinker.

Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of the society, I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents.\n\nFirst of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills, on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other's family. As a consequence, they never talk to each other since then.\n\nFollowing the previous paragraph, there will always be people of different living styles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering the society. \n\nThe society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others no matter who you are.

To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it, and it\u2019s entirely manageable.\nA literate reader knows the object-language's alphabet, grammar, and a sufficient set of vocabulary; a culturally literate person knows a given culture's signs and symbols, including its language, particular dialectic, stories, entertainment, idioms, idiosyncrasies, and so on. \nThe culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency, while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally-conditioned allusions, references to past events, idiomatic expressions, jokes, names, places, etc.\nAccording to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development, peace and democracy.\nMy personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand, learn and know about other cultures.

There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason; the shot clock. The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball. The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled. A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that's exactly what sets him apart from the others.\n\nWhile watching or playing any kind of sport, there's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out, the game becomes dull and boring and you can't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide. The bottom line is; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the \"shot clock\" fundamental to the dynamics of the game.\n\nAnd for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand (as it is for most sports in general) are the values of practice and awareness. Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations, and the combination of the two is the only way to success, so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you.", "id": "1-127255", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "19640"}

Most of these, in fact, have very predictable plots, are full of cliches and since it's so easy to figure out how they will end, they are usually very boring. This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing \"Looper\" and thought \"Hey, I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it, and it was actually a really good one!\" \nThe story is set in the future, about thirty years from now, when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer, a looper, was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body. The main character is Joe, a looper who has to face an older version of himself sent back in time to be killed. By letting his older self go Joe changes his past, and therefore his future, leading to a series of unexpected events, and to an even more unexpected ending!\nMy expectations were not very high, but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good, in fact it was not boring at all, and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise. \nTime travelling is only a means to the development of the story, and the future society is quite similar to the present one, so even if you are not big science fiction fans, I suggest you give this movie a chance, I am sure you won't be disappointed.

We've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities, such as music classes, learning languages and playing sports. The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future. The haste that results from this process doesn't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality, regardless that it may compromise their kid's motivation and self-confidence, all because of their  \"is talent innate or can it be acquired?\".\n\nContemporarily, the most wide-spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply aren't. This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy, as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy. The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child's potential to become a known genius. One of the most common examples is Beethoven, known for composing high-quality piano pieces as a young child. Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed. Admittedly, I don't know it myself.\n\nAny one who challenges the aforementioned common-sense isn't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common, but still popular and not scientific, concurrent idea. Many do believe that a talent can be taught, although not so easily. The \"10 000-hours rule\" is said to have a scientific base, in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it. According to this rule, any person can develop a talent after 10 000 hours of training. This amount of time doesn't fit normal workers and students' tight schedules and busy daily lives, therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable. The normal response to this conclusion is, as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you don't have this time available, is the loss of motivation.\n\nThe main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative. Either of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children. One asserts that talent is a matter of luck; the second, of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication. Clearly, both rely on the common beliefs to be sustained. As any other unscientific \"truth\" that circulates and cause harm to our society, this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised  publications on the topic, so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted, before the popular believes take our motivation and self-belief away.\n", "id": "1-70202", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "11352"}

One of the reasons is they are poor because they cannot get a job. I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills.\n\n Those who become homeless usually do not know that there is a system to help poor people. For example, if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live, they can get a financial support by government. However, those who do not know about it cannot get such support. Homeless people tend to unable\u3000to collect information because of lack in means to do it.  We need to let them get information. \n \n Skills are also needed to get a job. The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships. I have seen a TV program about homeless people. In the program, one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office. He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them. He was tired of himself, lost interest in working and became homeless. Then, he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free. He decided to join the class. Sometimes the lesson was hard, but the staff there praised him when he did well. Little by little, he grew interest in working. He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations. He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows. He finally wanted to find a job again. If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills, the problem of homelessness will become less serious.\n\n To conclude, giving information about support that they can receive from the government, and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan.

Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem, despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world. Now I will discuss both sides.\n\nOn the one hand, global warming is a result of many emitted toxic gases. These are, for example, carbon dioxide and methane. As we all know, trees store carbon dioxide. So, we can say, with less deforestation there would be less global warming. But what are the results of global warming? The primary outcome is the increasing temperature, and this leads to melting glaciers. These glaciers are habitat for polar bears and many other arctic animals. The melting glacier will bring a higher sea level. That means coastal cities will be flooded. This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees.\n\nOn the other hand deforestation is, as said, another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees. But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife. Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation. Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil, and now, it will be blown away by the wind. \n\nTo sum up both issues have enormous impacts on our world. In both animals and people are affected.

Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution. In addition, every phenomenon is based on theory. When employees face any problems or difficulties in work, it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon, without knowing this theory employees can\u2019t overcome these difficulties, for instance, engineering science seems practical, but each part of engineering science is based on theories. Thereby, engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career. \n\nSecond of all, theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees, as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way. Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems, beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information. Then employees are able to suggest the best solution, this approach is  developed in formal education. Moreover, studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees. Finally, knowledge could make an open-mined person who has ability to deal with problems in fairway. \n\n\nTo conclude, theoretical knowledge is more important than practical skills.

There  is more than one way to look at this statement. The use of  public transport has a lot of advantages, but on the other hand, some disadvantages can be distinguished. It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the  day\n In this article both sides are discussed. First what are the advantages of using the bus, or train? When traveling to city centers, choosing public transport is to be advised, because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space.  When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights, by car it is hard to get from on place to the other, because the circulation is dense. IN that way it will take a lot of your time, while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes, and hence are running smoothly. In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable. \nWhen  traveling to rural areas, it  is quite difficult by public transport, because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus  for the far out places and the tiny villages. Another problem might be the timetable. Because not may people going to these places, the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour. If there  is a bus or train available, it will stop at almost every village. Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming. \n\nIn the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip.

Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases, the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary, political, and communal life of tribal society. \n However, in its present form, the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan, law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions.

However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces. In my opinion, we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance.\n\nFrist of all, the biggest problem is that the world's resources are extremely unequal. For example, Japan is the world's third largest economy after the United States and China, its economy is so developed, but food, oil, and other resources are all imported, and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment. This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor, while the environment is also getting worse and worse. \n\nSecendly, with the increasing of the earth's population, the area of farmland is also decreasing. People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving. So I think that the government must do something in this respect. \n\nThe government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development . I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping's hybrid rice, or after the food can make people's great and then vigorously develop the economy.

A small cinema, a library, games rooms, a TV-room with an enormous flat screen TV where teenagers usually watch football matches, a basic gym, and a little arena.\n\n- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters. It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot. The main problem is the high price of the tickets. Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else.\n\n- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall.

To begin with, they help us solve really complex mathematical equations. They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place anyway. Computers are an essential part of  NASA, since they try to calculate really complex equations to help them solve the mysteries of space. But us, ordinary people, don\u2019t use computers to solve equations, we use them to type things, print things, design things, make games and to do much more... We made programs that make computers do very interesting things, like graphics. And we use graphics to make all kinds of things, like games or 3D house models that help engineers. Furthermore, the major thing that computers made easier for us is, communication. Humans are social animals, we communicate because communication is in our genes, if we don\u2019t communicate we go insane. So computers help us do that, they help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily. Finally, while doing this they actually save us from using a lot of paper. So computers help us with so many things and also save trees.\n\tIn the other hand, computers have very bad effects on both to us, and the environment. For example, research has shown that not computers themselves, but the things we use or play on them are addictive, like social networks or games. Also looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever. Despite the fact that computers decreased the use of paper, they\u2019re still harmful to the environment since they consume tonnes of electricity.\n\tComputers made our lives easier without doubt, so it is normal that they have some bad effects.

Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option, because it opens the door to university, while technical institutes are put in a corner. That is actually a mistake, because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes, who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences. Conversely, grammar schools extremely focus on theory. In fact, students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life. I think that problem should be addressed.\n\nSuggestions\nWhat I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools, like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes. Furthermore, schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years, which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would, but it would also attract more people to the school itself.\n\nConclusion\nPeople should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience, and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing.", "id": "1-276312", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "37958"}

Instead, I suppose that public transport will play an essential part in future life. There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain.\n   On one hand, it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars. Nowadays, buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities. They produce no gas to the air, leading to little air pollution. In the meanwhile, if people prefer to take buses or subways, there will be less noises in the street. On the other hand, buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally. Compared with cars, public transport has larger capability of conveying, which saves space and costs less. Last but not least, fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours. Thus, it will be more smooth and pleasant for passengers to travel on the road.\n   In conclusion, public transport is a cost-effective way for people to travel, which also contributes to the sustainable development of society.", "id": "1-193818", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "14739"}

This statement fails to consider the main function of education, which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape. The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions, not making decisions for students.\n\nAmong various purposes of education, in my opinions, the most important one is teaching students to solve problems. Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside, trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning, always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating, all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving. Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education. If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful, we\u2019ll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein, who were considered as stupid kids in school but didn\u2019t give up trying. Convincing students to take a more comfortable road by giving up the possible risk is definitely not the proper attitude the educational institution should have.\n\nOne may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest, however, teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions. Truly that knowing one\u2019s limit is the first step of bringing out the maximum value of one\u2019s talent. It\u2019s not smart to encourage people doing what exceed their ability. Nevertheless, the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences. One would never know he/she can swim or not without jumping into the swimming pool. The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he/she won\u2019t be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him/her from getting close to the water. Educational institutions should guide students to have better self-understanding and self-assessing, not persuading them to follow the pre-decided road.\n\nLast but not least, what is the definition of \u201csuccess\u201d? How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not? What if a student would rather to do something he/she likes instead of he/she is good at? Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with, such as wealthy, fame or power. For some people, living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life. They might not be the top, but they are self-actualized and satisfied, and only in such situation they can provide most to the world, just like Albert Einstein has said, \u201cTry not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value.\u201d\n\nConsidering all the above, I cannot agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions. In my opinions, the purpose of the education is to teach and guide students how to facing the problems and making their own decision properly, not force them to accept what have already been arranged for them. \n", "id": "1-53895", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "8866"}

He did like his job but as we all know, sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something. They don't know exactly what they should do, what to change - buy a new pair of shoes or maybe do something more - move to a different city or even to a foreign country. Michael had exactly the same problem.\nOne day he woke up much earlier than used to. He prepared a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news. He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same, nothing has changed since such many years! \"I won't stand it any longer\" - he thought. But what to do? A crazy idea came to his mind.\nSince Michael was a child he has always dreamt of moving to Australia, where he could practise kitesurfing for all day long, meet open-minded people, chill on a sandy beach and drink a good Australian alcohol.\n\"Why shouldn't I give myself a chance to make my dreams come true? People have only one life, not more!\"\nAt that moment he was pretty sure what to do now. He took a sheet of paper and a pen and started to write. After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael's boss. He arrived on the company as quickly as the crowded London's streets allowed him.\n\"I need to talk to boss\" - he said to Jane, the main secretary of the company. Without waiting for her answer, he just went into the office, gave to Mike, his boss for 10 years, an envelope with a resignation letter and left. It all took about 3 minutes.

The words coming up from his mouth like a litany, almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back. Tears ran down Rachel's face. No words, not a single comment. She just stood up, took her purse, and left. The relieve of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness. He now realized.

For studying a language, people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills. Furthermore, people need to have a good memory to remember a large number of words. In general, studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent. However, for learning mathematics, students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions. Instead of rote learning, they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples. To sum up, teachers, skills and talent are more important for learning mathematics. \n   However, there are some similarities for those two subjects. Firstly, both those courses need to do a mass of practices, even the ways are different. People need to spend a huge account of time on doing exercise after class. Secondly, associability is important for both languages and mathematics. For example, when people learn a new word or a formula, they need to think about how to use it in real sentence or exercises. \n  In conclusion, people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects. It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their study. \n", "id": "5-152191", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "583d4b2a-ffc7-445a-b9a0-28b19ab03f8a"}

The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective. However, their whole lives will be turned upside down when an elegible bachelor and his friends set up home in a close mansion. Surprisingly enough, sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) meets single, rich, and proud Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). All in all, will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice?\nKeira Knightley, in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, delivers an outstanding performance. In fact, the film, well cast from top to bottom, is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations, as in many British productions.\nIn this adaptation, the screenwriter makes some substantial alterations to the novel. Therefore dialogues, settings as well as politeness, costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal, sacrificing historical accuracy. Thus, overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure, several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings, and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story\nTo conclude, Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation which completely bewitches you with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit. In fact, in its final minutes, it makes you believe, for one misty-eyed moment, in true love and in order reigning in the universe.

A friend is a treasure, as the title of that adventure-comedy film, somebody you can share your problems with. Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes, your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them, your plans for the future, and moreover pays special attention on times of crisis. \nThis is  why the members of my family are my best friends. My family loves me whatever I think or whatever I do, no matter if it is correct or not.  They love me just because I am me, for who I am.\nThey are always  going to tell me the truth although this truth could hurt me, because they always want me to be happy.  Finally, they warn me of danger but they let me do, even if in the end I\u00b4d make a big mistake. They\u00b4d keep always  close to me and neither would fail  .

It is an oil painting, painted on poplar wood. The painting is most famous for the smile of the woman, which people have been trying to decipher for a long time. Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself, while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting.\n\nThe portrait depicts a woman's bust, with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop. Leonardo used a pyramid design to install the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting. The woman is shown with her hands folded, with her breast, neck, and face painted the same color as her hands. The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman's smile. Many believe that it is innocent and inviting, while others believe it is that of smugness and is a smirk. Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery. It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented.\n\nThe woman is shown seated in an open area, and behind her is a vast landscape, which recedes to an icy mountain. Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background.\n\nThe painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty.

We use it to communicate with friends, to play games, to watch series, the list is endless. Unfortunately, it is not perfect. Because the more people use the Internet, the greater the chances are of people misusing it. Luckily, the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet. What it comes down to is, should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments?\n\nWithout the interference of the government, criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users. They could get into our computers and steal our information. They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money.\n\nHowever, if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely, it would be considered an invasion of our privacy. Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government. \n\nThis brings me to the next issue. The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet, but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose. Everybody likes to have the freedom to explore the internet. So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them.\n\nTo sum things up, the government should not control the internet more tightly. It is fine the way it is right now. That way, the most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while at the same time, the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web.\n", "id": "1-325776", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "43208"}

How did we become the person we are?  Is there something that makes us unique? Is it the genes we are born with? Or are we a product of our own lives? \nIt is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are. Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders. Therefore, what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made. \nThose who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes. Nevertheless, identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities. This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today.\nRegarding personal skills, there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood. However, nature doesn\u00b4t always endow us with inborn abilities. For instance, parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and, consequently, they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field. According to this fact, parents often shape their children\u00b4s lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps. Likewise, some people put their success in life down more to their parent\u00b4s training than to their innate talents. \nSo, to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are. As I see it, personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us. The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case. \n", "id": "1-130258", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "19981"}

With firm determination, they can continue their education and work to feed their family as well.\n\nFinally, sometimes people think they have completed their education, but when they get a full-time job, they realize that diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion. Moreover, some employers select the potential employee from colleges while they are studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because they see their profit in that investment. Hence, studying and working side by side helps candidates to grow professionally.\n\nIn conclusion, working and studying is very much possible. It just depends on the dedication and determination of the person. People should do both study and work side by side to make themselves more skilled and capable.", "id": "5-4360295", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "5b3db4a3-9ed8-4d55-9dbe-b57f05e29f5a"}

Two perfect stigmas for a man and a woman in general. The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy. I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult, a woman, a wife, a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy. However, I am non-American and I live with a man who surprises me every day in a positive and also in a negative way. I cannot describe my own husband. Is it really possible to describe a man at all? No. I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time, but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive. I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life, experience and surrounding I live in. Let me introduce one American I got friends with on Facebook. His name is Kyle. A typical American name, right? However, he is not typical. He is special. I like his humor, because he is able to make me smile. His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences. I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land. He is wise and brave, because he was not scared to teach me although he is not a teacher. But what about those snakes and guns in his photos? Would I be able to overcome my own phobias and be fair? And what about those open-hearted quotes, love songs and poetic opinions he shares on his wall? Is he a romantic and a killer in one? He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo, love is just a quote and lying is the new truth. He is the man and I am the woman who live in the world, in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile.\nHe always writes gentle words, uses cute smileys, Facebook kisses and hugs, but when I ask him in what way he loves me, he answers \"as a Christian\". Well, it\u00b4s all right. I\u00b4m relieved. However, the woman inside of me shouts: What? He does not love me as a woman! How come! I would like to point out another his attribute which is his pride. When I asked him, if he had read a book The Little Prince by Exup\u00e9ry because I am feeling like a fox, he asked me in an offended manner, if I know Larry, the comedian. Kyle is really prideful, but so are all the men. I don\u00b4t believe in the friendship between the man and the woman. There will always be some kind of sparkling either alluring or repulsing. \nNext thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything. If I want to sleep, he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest. So he is thoughtful. \nI must be honest for a while. He rose up my own enslaved desires. I have always wanted to fly, to travel, to paint, to write and to love. And I am left to love without any support. He asked me to observe him for a week. However, I am scared a bit of the consequences of this secret adventure. What if it breaks me down? I mean what if he tames me like a fox? He is a hunter. All the men are.\nIn following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument. It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny, but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him. I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts lively and vividly. However, ask him a question from his real life and he will give you a one-word answer. This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me, not only an interviewer from a daily journal.\nI believe he is tender and careful, but impatient and clumsy at the same time. He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland. No matter what you write, he follows his own lust. On the other hand,he is disciplined, because he is able to stop with his imagery at once. He is cute, anyway. \nAs I wrote before it was not that easy to make the argument with him. I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue, for example: You are totally uninterested to read between lines! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum. He just kept quiet and begged me to stop. He did his best to calm me down. I was impressed and I find this a good feature of his personality. \nYesterday I wanted him to tell me the story of his life. He went with the trip from California to Texas and then to Phoenix. If you like adventurers, well, he is the right man for you. \nSport is a part of men. I should not bypass this issue. So I asked him what his favourite sport is.He likes baseball, but he does not play baseball actively. He likes watching it. He actively does hiking, hunting and camp riding. \nThe week has passed, so we are at the end of this adventure course. Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot. Honestly, I asked myself, if I would like to be his future wife. I pondered this many times. And surely, I will. However, I am not that crazy to marry the man whom I not know in real life. But I do like him and I loved the course. It surely taught me a lot and enriched my whole life. Thank you, Kyle. \nIn the end, I would like to add a quotation by Franz Marc. I do not know who Franz Marc is. But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship. \"Blue is the male principle, stern and spiritual. Yellow the female principle, gentle, cheerful and sensual. Red is matter, brutal and heavy and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by the other two.\"", "id": "1-57376", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "10358"}

The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population\u2019s interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area.\n\nRecycling\nThrough a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling. Therefore, in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned. This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal. \n\nPublic Transport\nSince exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays, the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport, in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars. Consequently, there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes, so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently. Unfortunately, only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community, thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society.\n\nPublic Cleaning Services\nOur local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal, storage, collection and transport of waste material, but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community. The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat, making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit.\n\nConclusion\nTaking everything into consideration, it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside. However, as with all issues present within society, a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor.\n     \n\n\n", "id": "1-95609", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "11379"}

However, when we talk about hunger we must regard it as the main problem of the world.  That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation. It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design.\n\nIt consists of a pill where we blend lots of different elements. Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day. Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire. They can be conserved for a long time and shipping costs are very low.\n\nI consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world.", "id": "5-2688153", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "59fae92f-ea64-4cb7-9220-1f0673089199"}

The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it's also a beautiful,  delicate plus to this masterpiece. \n\nLife is beautiful was recipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as for best foreign picture, best actor and best original dramatic score.\n\nWhat strikes me  more was that despite the fact that it\u2019s set on the eve of the II world war,  the film isn\u2019t really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope.

I have learned a lot of things from it.\n\nWhen I joined the team freshman year, I didn\u2019t realize what I was getting into. Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful. We worked all summer in the weight room and ran on the track to get in physical and mental shape before the season. \n\nSee, football is more of a mental sport than anything else, so running on the track wasn't only about getting in shape. We would push our minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt like we were going to pass out. At the beginning, I was immature and only thought of myself, sometimes even giving up when I was tired or hurting. Then after the third game I had a season-ending injury. Imagine working all summer and then only being able to play three games! I needed surgery on my arm and at least five months to recover. \n\nNeedless to say, I was sidelined for the rest of the season, but this actually helped me realize that since you never know when your last play will be, you should try your hardest in football and life.\n\nAfter freshman year I decided that I would always give my best effort. Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block. I have learned to think about others first, and realized how important working hard is. Being with all my friends, even sweating and bleeding with them, really made us bond as a group of hard-working young men I know will succeed in life.\n\nHigh-school football is more than just a sport. It is a learning ground for many to strengthen their personality and character for their lives. One thing my coach always says is, \u201cImagine that you have just run 100 sprints and a giant bear starts chasing you. Are you just going to stand there and let it attack you because you are too tired?\u201d The answer, of course, is no, because you can always put it in another gear even if you think you need to give up. This to me means that you can always control your attitude and effort. So, no matter what, if you maintain a great attitude and always give whatever you\u2019re doing your best effort, you will have no regrets.", "id": "1-165412", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "19836"}

This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked.\nSecondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain-public and private-, which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges.\nKnowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary. So, the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure. \nTeachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should comprise the past information and the new one. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages.\nThis new technologies also help in the teaching development. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools, in the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations.\nIn conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge.

But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything. The manufacturing process follows three main stages: designing then producing then consuming. For a quick glimpse, this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object. This directly affects the producing stage, allowing more efficient production.\n    More efficient production means cheaper goods, and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods. Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money. In other words, money would have more value. So, let's say, you have $100,000 now, you would have $10,000,000 fifty years from now. You then could pay your debt, get a new car, buy a new house, invest or retire, or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $10,000,000 in your bank account. Looking at it through a broader scope, country deficits would be solved, hungry people would be fed, and the homeless would get accommodated.\n    But why would the goods be cheaper? This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit. With competition giving him no choice at all, the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium. Surprisingly, the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce. This automatic, efficient, quick, precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed, saves waste initially caused by human errors, saves time and produce at better quality too.\n    In conclusion, this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods, and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world.\n", "id": "1-256109", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "35873"}

You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it. And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one. \nWhen I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School, I said it\u2019s the worst thing that ever happened to my career. When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz, I said I was so unfortunate, and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain, I said my life would be miserable. Indeed, negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most. \nBut after a year, I was all wrong. \nMy first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization. To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation; I have never been unfortunate, and misery has never been my colleague. In fact, being a teacher in the mountain is being the best of who I am, being the most fortunate of men alive, and being the happiest I could ever be. \nYes, Gala National High School has given me thousands of reasons to be happy and to feel blessed. In here, I have learned more than the lessons I have taught. The school as a whole has become my great mentor. It has taught me lessons I couldn\u2019t have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry. Gala has paved the way for me to become that teacher I long to see. I may have been far yet from being an ideal one, but I know someday, having Gala as my guiding light, I can become one.\nAs to my colleagues, I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me. We are so small a number, but that does not hinder us to hold any school program and activity at its best. With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm, we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile. We never settled for any mediocrity. That is us \u2013 the teachers of Gala. And that\u2019s one thing I love the most. Together, we aspire for something beyond better. \nMy personal relationship with my co-teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family. It\u2019s not all the time that we are in good terms, but we know to ourselves that we care for each other. I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance, and they may have hurt me too, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s always camaraderie among us that dominates. And it\u2019s all that matters. \nAs to my students, I feel really so fulfilled. At first, it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountain. Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger. Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life\u2019s resentment. As a teacher, it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students. Hence, the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me. And that\u2019s one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep to myself forever. \nStudents in the mountain have a lot of different untold stories of their lives. These stories once heard, can open somebody\u2019s heart to learn to love learners despite everything. That is what exactly happened to me. As I listened to my students, I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher. Consequently, I have seen the need to attend to their needs. I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities, but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala, I have made a difference to my students' lives. \nMy everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment. Eventually, the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job. My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life, but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on. My dear students may have not known it, but really, they are too the source of my inner strength. There were times I wanted to back off from the many demands of work, but I always found myself fighting.

These are my study methods, if I can say so.\n\nAbout the reasons to take the test, there is little to say.

That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic. Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion. I would like to emphasise two options in this essay.\n\nOne way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio-file. This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people. Additionally, it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator\u2019s mind. However, sometimes the narrator tends to fill in the gaps of his/her memory with imaginary parts or tries to embellish certain parts of the story.\n\nAnother interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs. This is an impressive way to document a change over many years, but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition.\n\nFor me personally, the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly, I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more. Secondly, I can catch the  the narrator\u2019semotions.

However, speaking, listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays. All these changes make the learning process much more fun, creative and practical for the students. \nThe new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have. This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners\u00b4 skills. A grammar test shows knowledge about the language, whereas alternative assessment shows learners\u00b4 ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation.\nThere are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques: learners demonstrate things learned, take responsibility, motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes.\nIt is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers, since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods.\nIn conclusion: The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain. The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently. However, a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education-related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years.\n", "id": "1-157952", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "23680"}

Law enforcers also wanted for their country to win, and in the United States policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan. The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend-setter. The winner's reward was the ability to rule over Japan for a day. After two years, the winner was decided, and he made Japan go into poverty. Once the day was over, the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done, but it was impossible. The winner had changed Japan's landscape, what once was the amazing city of Tokyo now was a sad and dirty city. Japan asked the United states for help, they gladly agreed, and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status. Japan lost a lot, but it was able to get back up on its feet. Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved, but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well, but they were able to defend themselves. Japan launched a counter attack and enslaved the United States, and then proceeded to conquer the world.

The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day.\n\nFirst of all, an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume. If the car is large enough, it can be even a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us just to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages.\n\nOn the other hand, we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car. For instance, staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones, therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own.

Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive, it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money. Many people think that public transport is only for poor and not for rich. If it continues, no resource will be spared for the future generation.\n  Everyone should remember, \"Nature has enough resources to satisfy our needs, not our greed.\" ", "id": "1-41421", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "8422"}

When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms. I was sharing a room with my friend Emily. After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort. We found a club, 3 big pools, sports fields and, of course, the amazing beach, though we couldn't see much of it because it was really dark at night. The next day, we made sure to go to the beach early and we had a blast with our other friends. This went on until the last day of our trip.

Well then, let's start with the time we eat and what we eat at those moments here in Holland. On weekdays, Dutch people take their breakfast, which usually consists of a few sandwiches, somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend, we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later. Around 12.00 a.m., most people have lunch, which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as breakfast. When the clock strikes 6.00 p.m., it's time for dinner, the only warm meal of the day as well as the heaviest meal of the day.\nLet me also tell you something about traditional Dutch meals. The most important ones are probably hotchpotches: mashed potatoes and vegetables, often combined with smoked sausage. In my opinion, some of them are absolutely revolting. A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty, consists of little thick pancakes, served warm with melted butter and icing sugar. Those pancakes are called \"poffertjes\". They can be eaten any time of the day, for breakfast, lunch, supper... Whole generations are brought up with this dish, yummy as it is.\nIs this enough information for your project? If you want to know more about Dutch eating habits, just write to me, and I'll write back, giving you any other information you might need.

Almost all of them were heard shouting in panic \" There has been a terrorist attack in our neighborhood \". But there was only one who knew what and where that explosion had occurred. He was in disbelief, flabbergasted, never expecting that the person living next door would do something so heinous. \n                                          Just a day before Michael was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy. Well educated, open-minded, a liberal at best. So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula, that does not implicate that he is a terrorist. He has been living in the U.K for the past 20 years. \n                                                         But this act was out of question. This was something that could not be argued upon. Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do, the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police. After briefing the call respondent about every detail that he had known about Rasheed. He darted towards the backyard, jumped over the hedges. Sprinted towards what seemed like flames, only to find Rasheed standing across it, blood protruding from his right hand. In just a split second the whole incident was explained. What Michael thought to be a terrorist attack was a gas cylinder exploding. First came the confusion and then remorse. Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.\n                                                   ", "id": "1-101274", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "16649"}

A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills, and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to focus and pay attention while you are in front of a TV screen. Getting distracted is extremely likely, therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel, as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing.\n\nHad I choose whether considering television educational or not, I would definitely say it is.

You have always been a very bad liar!\"\nHe held his breath for a second, pursed his lips\n and then words just slipped of his tongue.\n\"We are broken. We do not have any money left. So I have found a job\".\n\"Are you kidding me? You have never worked in your life. What can you possibly do?\"\n\"I am a porter. Every morning I went to the port and unshipped. Nobody there knows me so you should be afraid that some of our friends would recognise me. Nobody will never know that we are poor now\".\nIt was her turn to hold her breath. She was just numb. He was strong as an ox, for sure, but working as a porter? This should be some kind of joke. He was waiting for her response.\nShe had always been level-headed and tried to come up with a plan.\n\"We can  move to smaller house or fired some of the servants?\"\n\"That is impossible! What would our friends say? And where I would put my wine collection? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house\"\nThey definitely had different idea of poverty. But before clearing that she wanted to ask one more important question:\nWhere, for God's sake, had the money gone?!", "id": "1-293694", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "37495"}

This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows. By releasing all episodes at once, each user can watch each chapter at their own rate and speed, devouring them all in an afternoon or only one per week.\nThe series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit. This connection allows them to see through each other eyes, and even control each other movements. In order to make the series more interesting, the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country. This decision made the series extraordinary, with scenes recorded in Seoul, Nairobi, San Francisco, Mumbai, London, Berlin, Mexico and Chicago. The series provides an amazing window into eight different, and extraordinary worlds, with beautiful landscapes.\nTo sum up, I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science-fiction, but also to anyone curious about different cultures as \"Sense8\" provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters, their surroundings, religion, and traditions.", "id": "1-268201", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "7195"}

Besides that, this restaurant is located in the heart of one of the most popular cities in southeast Asia, Kuala Lumpur. I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window. From my experience, I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is. Not only that, I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food, Indonesian food, Chinese food and the list goes on. The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu. \n\nIn my opinion, I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night.

Today, the Internet is one of the most effective and efficient ways to communicate. Telephones changed, technology became smarter and allows people to stay connected everywhere they go. Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us, the use of technology affect people's ability to communicate face to face. We communicate through our accounts, emails or chats. We just take  turns talking (chatting is maybe more correct to say) and most of the times without any aim. Using messages people forget to use grammar or even make full sentances. But that's not the biggest problem. The worst thing is that people don't know how to talk to each other, how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends. Emoticons replace emotions, chats replace calls, usernames replace people. Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident.

That was it. It really was over between him and Marianne. After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents' life, not him, Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh, he has finally chosen the latter, thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment. But now, every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself, making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not. He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne. Both good and bad.\n\nTheir first date was more or less awkward, which was typical for most first dates in life. He had taken her out to a five-star restaurant, to which she insisted that it was too much, which got Michael to insist that it was okay. But all awkwardness aside, it ended with a first kiss. A tidal wave of feelings sparked inside Michael's head as he moved his lips along with Marianne's.\n\nA few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight. Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home, which made Marianne completely furious; throwing things to the wall, crashing plates from the counter to the ground, the whole nine yards. After Michael barely calmed Marianne down, they had a mature heart-to-heart, one someone would say was way too late, but at that moment, it felt right.\n\nHis mind then thought of their last kiss. Man, when was that? It had to be about a fortnight ago, before he went to Sochi for a business meeting. It was merely a goodbye kiss, a quick brush of lips before he had to rush to the airport. A week later, he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he didn't have the mind to remember the name of. It was the unofficial end of the relationship, the decision before the actual talk. But at that moment, it ended.\n\nBut, in life, you can't hold onto the past. You have to keep moving forward. You have to carry on. And one day, you'll find the true love that you'll trust, the one that'll catch you when you fall, console you when you cry.

The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci-fi TV shows on television. Actually, last year was its 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a special episode in 3D was broadcast. \nSince the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors, the newest one was announced on summer last year, which is when I was visiting London with my family. It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor, it appeared in the news, in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it. However, I really liked experiencing that because I had never seen the media in Spain pay so much attention to a TV show.  Since I was in London, I thought it could visit The Who Shop, it is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show. We didn\u2019t have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go only with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else. If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway, I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop.\nWhen the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor, many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they didn\u2019t like it. But hopefully not everyone was like that. When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it, that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor. Nobody liked him at first but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay. Actually, I\u2019m one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one, as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role. \nAnyway, before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor\u2019s role, the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him. Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role.\nI found out about Doctor Who because a friend of mine saw people talking about it online and she told me about it. When I started watching it I thought it was a bit weird but I ended up really liking it. Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows. I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention, also I like it because the plot is incredible, something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes.\n", "id": "1-40772", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "8345"}

Since I was a kid, I have started to think of being a teacher. That\u2019s why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway.\n\nSince I was in F.5, when I became capable to teach somebody, I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor. From these experiences, I discovered that teaching people will never be an effortless job. As a teacher, I have to be considerate, unbiased, trustworthy and decisive. I have to try my best to take care of all students and to ensure that the contents are accessible for them. Apart from that, it has been a good practice for speaking. As a teacher, I have to talk in front of many students and that fostered me to become a better speaker. I have gained a lot from these experiences.\n\nAs to enhance my knowledge, I tried to grab chance to bring up my English level. In 2014, I had completed the \u2018Let\u2019s Debate\u2019 writing program offered by The Standard and written a total of 4 articles for the \u2018Let\u2019s Debate\u2019 column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard. It had been a truly valuable program for me and it brushed up on my English. Moreover, I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015. Although I was not able to attain any awards in the competition, I gained a lot of public speaking skills from the competition. These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events.\n\nApart from that, as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people, I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself. Starting from F3, I learnt Korean and I attained level 5 in TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean). I have also been preparing for the level 6 test since then. Other than Korean, I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish starting from F5. Learning languages is indeed difficult and painstaking. However, I enjoy my journey in learning them. Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me, it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification. That\u2019s why I love learning foreign languages.\n\nIt is my aspiration to devote my time to the study of English and education. I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university. It has been my life goal to become an English teacher in order for me to make contributions to our society.

I would totally agree with the idea that children should not use mobile phones during class, but during breaks.\n\nIn the first place, it seems to me that it is really important, both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules. However, it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone, and proper times to learn. Of course, we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but, mostly, whenever we need. Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then, have a bit of distraction when they are not there and, what is more, keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need. That is why I totally agree with Richardson\u2019s modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students, schools and parents lives nowadays. \n\nSecondly, I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes, and what is more, with Richardson\u2019s facing this issue. Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives, so we should incorporate it to our habits. Of course, when we are talking about children and education, it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages.  For instance, it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms. However, teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there, and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective, as you say in one of your paragraphs: \u201cThe Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk\u201d .  \n\nI consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because, firstly, students are the ones who must be present and, what is more, their learning process also must be there.  As I said, it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents, so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need. Apart from that, I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom, but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective. \n\nAll in all, I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject. Technology and, mostly, mobile phones are part of children and parents lives, so schools don\u2019t have to ban it, but look for alternatives in order that they don\u2019t make a negative effect in education. Richardson\u2019s methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more, and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue. \n\nI look forward to reading more articles about this subject. \n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMagali Hervieux. \n", "id": "1-267160", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "37066"}

A survey about the kind of customers for our product revealed that most of them are young adults. This means that they are between 20 and 30 years old.\n\nAfter studying our advertising options, it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose. One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we can set up stands in shopping malls. In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples.\n\nAs I mentioned above, advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us. This is mainly because besides being cheaper customers will become familiar with the product.\n\nIn conclusion, we have different options for this campaign.

The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again, he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called 'other humans' and under the 'illusionary protection' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist-attack.\n\nThis is the world of globalisation where the entire world is one market. Every person is marketing himself; is selling himself; is presenting himself as a decorated gift-item.\nThis is why, although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet, we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge.\nI, for that reason, certainly agree with the statement of the given issue. With knowledge and information, things become comprehensible but more complex.\n\nThe religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world. It, today, has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied-up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives. Interestingly, Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements, for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries.\n\nIn contrast to this, the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge, however they had a much deeper impact. They were simple yet profound, relying on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness and karma.\nScientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions, however, ironically, it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology.\n\nLikewise, there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation (illuminati, for instance) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre-timed wars and terrorist-attacks. The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political; it rules over the international media, thereby being omnipotent. Furthermore, they concoct stories and concepts, publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet.\nThe brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance, finally becoming brainwashed.\nThe same technique is used by politicians, iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology. They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk, whence he becomes the follower and a voter.\n\nThus, by all means, today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information.\nNevertheless, there is a stomach-wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being-exploited life.", "id": "1-24986", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "5197"}

There are several reasons why I support this choice. First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus. \n\nIn contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also help them become independent young adults.

CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher, but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language, the artistic. How to provide student with more real and relevant input, in the daily routine of an art class, seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers, who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language. \n\nDespite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome, the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special. What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support, the cooperation and the comradeship.

However, there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist. In this essay I will discuss two of these: the immersion method, and the classroom method.\n\nFirstly, the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue: implicitly. With this method, learners are simply exposed to the target language, either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken, or by having a native teacher. There is no explicit focus on grammar; instead, the learners are expected to \u201cabsorb\u201d the language and its rules. This method has its advantages, as it is the way we all learnt to speak, and so it is arguably more natural. Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated, confusing metalanguage.\n\nSecondly, the classroom method is the one with which most students (especially if they are older) are familiar. Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue, and are given grammar rules, which they then apply to the language they are learning. This method also has its benefits, not least logistically speaking, since many students don\u2019t have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad. Furthermore, some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules, which make them aware of the mistakes they are making.\n\nWhile both methods clearly have their advantages, I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning. Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language, while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self-correction and self-study.  I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English.\n", "id": "1-268071", "cefr": "C2.ii", "userid": "37083"}

The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine; it has three main sections: the feed section, the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e. fan). In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel (i.e. the pellet) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air. Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet. As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that, thanks to the fan, will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient (e.g. room, bathroom, kitchen...). This is a pretty compact machine but it's not very efficient and very clean. Actually, it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano-particle.\nLet's focus now on the pellet boiler. The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove, the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house, so it's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan (the pourpose of a fan and a pump it's the same: move fluid from a point A to a pont B, but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water (they have a different density: water has 1000 times the density of air).\nLike in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber (according to the control system) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water. Now, thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms.\nBasically the two rely on the same methods: burning pellets to warm up a fluid (air for the stove and water for the boiler).\n", "id": "1-141604", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "20219"}

But with a heavy heart I have to agree with this statement. Why? There might appear a few situations, when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache. \n\nFirst of all, it is quite hard to enjoy shopping when you are forced to do it. The best example here could be the regular, every-week filling-the-fridge shopping, which in principle cannot be pleasant. Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley.  Crowd in every corner, awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another, because these shops are organised in the way, which forces you to see everything, in order to find what you really need.  That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging. \n\nWhat is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something. Because there is this wicked, unwritten rule, according to which if you are looking for something, there is not the slightest chance you will get it.  You will not be able to find the right size, the right colour or simply anything which would suit your taste. \nShopping with your husband, boyfriend, father or any representative of the male kind, also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever. I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your \u2018joie de vivre\u2019.  The constant grumbling, regular checking the time, this anxious and adrift facial expression \u2013 how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping?!  And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them, it always looks this way. \n\nIn conclusion, shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity, not only to expand contents of your wardrobe, but also, to relax and spend a great time. You just have to avoid supermarkets, buy clothes in advance \u2013 so there will not appear the situation, when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet, and of course of  the male company, better choose the female companion.\n", "id": "1-3125", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "130"}

I think that this is not a usual sport, but it has the same advantages: it burn calories, improve circulation, is good for the bones and muscles... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility. \n\nMy advice for people who would like to start dancing ballet is: don't be afraid, it doesn't matter if you are seven or seventy, if you want to do it you can.

Online learning has become a modern phenomena in order to gain knowledge; however, face-to-face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students. Although there are many differences among these two, similarities can be found as well.\n\nThe main similarity between face-to-face learning and online learning is that they both provide valuable learning skills to students. Currently, exist all types of courses via the Internet, at any academic or vocational level. For instance, degree courses, master courses or just an updating course can be found. Adding to this, both learning options require time and dedication from students; otherwise, knowledge will not be properly delivered.\n\nOn the other hand, differences between face-to-face learning and virtual learning are numerous. Firstly, online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule. Studentd can attend courses when they decide, but always respecting due dates. Another difference between face-to-face learning and online learning may be that face-to-face learning allows students to develop human-relationships, whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen. During face-to-face learning students have a teacher-student relationship, as well as a peer-to-peer relationship, allowing them to develop inter-personaal skills and coexistence. Last but not least, time spent on these courses are different too. When doing a fece-to-face course besides having an attendance schedule, people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given. In current days, traffic jams are a fact in big cities; therefore a lot of time is lost commuting.\n\nConsequentlu, both learning options have their positive and negative aspects.

However, there might be a problem with the choice as not every secondary school offers e.g. Spanish or Italian, so students have to choose a language they do not prefer.

There are also many adults who want to learn or just improve their language skills. Adults usually attend language courses, or use a variety of on-line courses.\n\nRecommended changes\nI would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish, Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons.

It is therefore no surprise that a person\u2019s age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled. Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience, while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability, namely whomever is most able to carry out the job. This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion.\nOn the one hand, many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions, and the implications of this opinion are clear. Those operating at senior levels within a country\u2019s military, for example, require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life. Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country\u2019s military, they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience, and this could have catastrophic results. Thus, is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions.\nHowever, there are several plausible counters to this argument. For one, younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government. For example, young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s, a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear. In addition to fresh ideas, it should be remembered that to get a government job, one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process. If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person, it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment. It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people.\nAlthough the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument, it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs.

In order to achieve its objectives, Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014. For example, it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement. The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube. Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s) in Youtube, they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times. Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is \u2018Hotels? Trivago\u2019. The audiences are easy to think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels.\n\nAlso, Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering Hong Kong Market. Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different country to feel the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle. Many of them try to plan the cheapest way for their trip include booking the worthiest hotel. If they aware the benefits of using Trivago, they will love to use this as they could spend less time to compare all the hotels. Therefore, Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong.\n\nMoreover, Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong. Trivago is not much common in Hong Kong. Some people even probably do not know what it is. If Trivago want to gain benefits from the Hong Kong market, it has to develop and enhance their brand image. Doing promotion is one of the ways to improve its image. Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market.\n\nThe last but not the least, Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms. Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application. If there are more people download its mobile application, it means more people to know its brand and use its service.\n\n \nCurrent advertising strategy\n\nWe found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong.  The advertisement is about 16 seconds. There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates \u201chow to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel.\u201d At the last of the video, the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago. We will analyze its strategies from different perspectives below.\n\nTelevision Commercial\n\nIn general, television is the most popular media in Hong Kong. Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public. Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time, more potential customers will be exposed to its service. If the advertisement is designed well, people will remember it.\n\nMoreover, television has the advantage of being able to utilize sight, sound and motion. Combining a catchy theme tune and a well-designed visual advertisement can increase the chances of viewers remembering the brand. This also allows for more creative options. As designers are not limited to using only sound or still images, they can create advertisements that are appealing visually and audibly. \n\nBackground Music\n\nMusic helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement. The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite. It can make people feel youthful and it matches to the taste of young adults which are Trivago\u2019s target customers. Besides, music also has other benefits. It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long-term memory. It can also increase the retention of visual information.\n\n\n\nDemonstration\n\nThe television advertisement shows the service being using. It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel, choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels. Through the demonstration, Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel. It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is.  \n\nOn the other hand, as a mobile application, some people probably feel confused about how it operates. Therefore, with the visual effect, demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application. \n\nInformative\n\nThe television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight-forward manner. The narrator directly indicates the functions of the mobile application. For example, he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites. For those who are high interested in hotel searching service, they may notice to such informative advertisement.\n\nCognitive Strategy\n\nIn the television commercial, Trivago uses cognitive message strategy. It clearly presented that its searching engine can help the customers to compare the price of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the most worthy hotel. This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition. This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers. At the same time, it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services. \n\nAs Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago, it needs to enhance its popularity in there. Before 2014, Trivago is not famous in Asia. It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives.\n\n\nConative Strategy\n\nOn the other hand, Trivago also applies conative strategy in the advertisement. In the television commercial, the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone. It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it. The purpose is to increase the sale and enlarge its market share in Hong Kong.\n\nMeans-End Chain\n\nMoreover, \u201cMeans-End Chain\u201d is adapted in the television advertisement. The leverage point of Trivago is providing hotel room search services. By using the Trivago\u2019s services, customers can search the worthiest price of the hotel room to gain benefit. \n\nTrivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement. Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation. The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip. \n\nMean-End Chain is being used as Trivago is not only to help customer search for a hotel room, but also to achieve the personal value for customer which is worthier than money the customer saved in booking a hotel room. Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased.\n\nTagline\n\nNevertheless, Trivago designs a tagline in the television commercial. The tagline \u2018\u2018Hotels? Trivago\u2019\u2019, can introduce the key idea of the television commercial. Audience can easily remember the brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Trivago services. Besides, it can also improve the consistency of advertising platforms. As the tagline is catchy, if the tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements, it will not be easy to stray from the main idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther communication tools\n\nTrivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated. People currently seldom listen to the radio. Attention of the radio commercial is low. Also, radio advertisements only contain verbal effect. Without the visual effect, it becomes less attractive. Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago, they probably do not know how to spell the word \u2018Trivago\u2019 as it is not a normal vocabulary. It makes people hard to search Trivago on the Internet. Therefore, the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough. \n\nNewspaper is also not a good media since newspaper has been recently replaced by online newspaper. Likewise, Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it. Lastly, hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion. And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company. Sometimes, if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement, the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson. The promoting objective is difficult to be achieved. Therefore, television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong.\n", "id": "1-105976", "cefr": "C1.ii", "userid": "16715"}

In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine, astronomy, computers, and history. People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world, about new civilizations and distant planets. Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of. Without its help, for example, we would have never realized were we have come from. It also gives us clues that there may be life on other planets and we might not be the most superior beings in the world. \n\n\n\n\nBy using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for. \n\n\n\n\nThere is no secret for the human beings today because they have explored every place on the Earth. They climb the highest mountains, dive in the depths of oceans, and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science. The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties. With its help, for example, people are able to cope with natural disasters. We know how to destroy hail clouds which can cause great damage to our crops. We are also able to protect ourselves from various diseases and help the sick. That is why science is so significant nowadays.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages. For example, we are obliged to agree that science has given no answer to man\u2019s doubts.

Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money, they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated. \n\nHowever, even with these arguments, demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well. With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated. And above that, without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings. This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them. \n\nAfter all, the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings, or at least a few of them, because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations.", "id": "1-160886", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "21630"}

Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue  because it is very difficult to give a clear-cut answer and so, it makes the process of discussion very exciting.  \nThere may be  a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing.   My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent. On the one hand, I personally think that the desire to become  famous is a great driving force that stimulates  people and brings a lot of benefits to others in  its wake. Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples  of it. If  we take football clubs, for  example, we can see that the desire to become well-known and popular makes football players very dedicated sportsmen. They  can fight against the odds to be in the top league. It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be  demonstrated by such sportsmen. Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation  of their clubs and countries as well.  What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that  somebody's  desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on  others. It means that other people feel challenged and don't want to fall  behind and look  underdogs. Without  this  stimulus  they may   have been inactive.   \n\nOn the other hand almost equal number of people may   maintain  a contrasting point of view. They  give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless. Such people  tried  to achieve their goal irrespective of the means. I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns. The desire of some country's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and  conflicts between countries. Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities.\n\nSo, all in all, we can not answer this  question as \"yes\" or \"no\" because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view.

Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying.Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally. \n\nBullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person. It can be classified into four types:\n\nPhysical (hitting, punching, or kicking)\nVerbal (name-calling or taunting)\nRelational (destroying peer acceptance and friendships)\nCyber-bullying (using electronic means to harm others)\n\nThose who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems. Bullying can cause loneliness, depression, anxiety, lead to low self-esteem and illnesses.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that self harm, low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools. We need to stop this. We need to do something to prevent it, before it's too late. Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying. I will treat others with respect and kindness.

He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food, this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes. One day before this new law was established, a crazy scientist created a new waffle, \"the great, furry waffle.\" This was an incentive for Jack to go out, he was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row, although he felt a bit sick after, he knew it was worth the try. There was a bit of conflict in his plan, the new waffle was in Texas, and he lived in Washington. He knew he wouldn't last a day in the heat, but there was nothing better than a new waffle. He saw on his mommy's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle, he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips. Jack bought a ticket to the earliest flight to Texas, once he got off the plane he ran through the landscape. He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America, that way he could fit in. Once he got to the laboratory where the pancake was made, he told the mad scientist that he wanted to eat his waffle. The scientist gave him \"the great, furry waffle\" and a bunch of syrup. Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth, he could taste heaven in his mouth. It was a combination of bacon, meat, and cheese with a little bit of butter. What he didn't expect was that all the hair had gotten stuck in his throat, leaving him unable to breathe! In a matter of seconds nothing he fell to the ground, choking. Suddenly, a giant fish fell from the sky, causing him spit out the hairball, Jack could not believe what he saw, the man riding the fish was Bugs Bunny!

These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly (Bob Greene, How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6). In fact, since the beginning, the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them, allowing life to be more harmonious. For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture, the Brazilian culture. There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow, and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture.\n\nOne of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns. When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech (1995), he was talking about the African American Communication, but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time. Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil, there are some facts about the extremes of it. First, Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time, without they have clear reasons. It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog; moreover, unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking. Surprisingly, on the other hand, a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule, and can be interpreted as an offense. In Brazilian culture, if during a conversation a person speaks too low, the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking. In both the extremes of a speech, loud and low, there is a violation of the values of a good communication. Therefore, when you are in a conversation, it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns.\n\nAs vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians, personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily. When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know, this space is your personal territory. And, it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person. In some countries like the United States, whose respect of personal territory is extremely important, the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching (Edward T. Hall). In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space, yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S. Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States, they are no tolerant with strangers invading it. Soon, even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil, both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable, called personal space.\n\nAlthough Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others, people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others. As a result, some people can make misinterpretations. For example, in some cultures, Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact, and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy. Differently, foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact. In general, this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog. According to article \" Nonverbal Communication: Speaking without Words\", eye contact is important because \"insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers\". In fact, in Brazil, the eye contact is primordial, being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to. The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids; it is hard to get exclusively the kid's attention, but the parents insistently repeat, \"look at me when I am talking to you\". Therefore, this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others' opinion.\n\nAfter being socially judged by the society, we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them. In Brazil, the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication. Also, the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country, and in Brazil are considered small, but everyone there appreciates this cultural value. Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others. As in Brazil, each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values. Because of these varieties of values and rules, usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations. Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts. In addition, you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own.", "id": "1-42055", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "8496"}

Bond, Morton and Braakhuis (2012) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator. The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them, which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure. Thus, the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic  blood pressure after the exercise. Nevertheless, a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement, once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise. Thus, the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue, the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance. It is unquestionable that some research found  significant improvements. In this present study, however, the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation. Importantly, it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either. It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production. Nevertheless, the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly. Finally, it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels, consequently reducing the blood pressure. By this action, beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising. Despite the present findings, it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation. By this action, athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life.", "id": "1-108891", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "16944"}

Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher, I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day. \n    To begin with, I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge. Of course, I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily, because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children. After all, my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated. The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide. Without teachers\u2019 guidance, self- studying may bring some problems to children, such as possible misunderstanding.  Networking educational contents are not safe at all. It is common for children to watch violence scenes. So, the teacher is a necessary part of the educational process.\n    Nowadays, young people graduate from universities, who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years. To be more precise, new educational methods promotes the students\u2019 teamwork. In other words, students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject. Furthermore, when it\u2019s necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves.  In this kind of education, teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own. Furthermore, it makes children more sociable. In contrast, interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial, because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people. They don\u2019t need to co-operate and to work as a team. This is bad, because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems.\n     To sum up, I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology. My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process.  I think that it is efficient when there is a combination of traditional education and interactive learning.\n", "id": "1-30284", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "6723"}

In addition, driving by yourself you are not limited by the stations you have to visit.

Class-E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques.\nClass-E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain theoretically 100% power efficiency. Class-E power amplifier (PA) was introduced by Sokal in 1975. These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency theoretically. However in practice there are some limitations such as, switch on - resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .\n", "id": "1-124570", "cefr": "C2.i", "userid": "3163"}

But what exactly makes spy stories so fascinating? There could be a lot of reasons, like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret; but in real life, what kind of person does a secret agent have to be?\n\nFirst of all, being a spy requires special skills; not everybody is suitable for this kind of life. For instance, the ability to bear both physical and psychological stress is not something you can easily learn. In the same way a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required. Therefore bravery is very important: nobody needs a fearful spy. A secret agent works undercover, so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying. Besides, since his work is secret, he can't let anybody, including family and friends, know about it.\n\nSo, although the life of secret agents may seem fascinating and exciting, it is also difficult and risky and not so simple as the one shown in films.", "id": "1-30965", "cefr": "C1.i", "userid": "6202"}
