{"text": "          Generally speaking, it has been suggested that mixed-sex education will improve to the degree of learning system at schools. In another way of saying, this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools. However, I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes, but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools.\n          Education has a crucial part in one society and it\u2019s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Nowadays, unfortunately, students cannot take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries. Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future.\n         On the other hand, by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority, students will encouraged them learn more efficient. Lack of teaching way, poor audience of the class, quantity of learning materials, for instance, all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system. Besides, by putting these kinds of procedures, students will  also gain more respect towards career and their job. Hopefully, they will reach not only earn more money in their entire life but also society will have more development shape in any other developed counties.\n           It is true that coeducation can motive the student while they work with other sex group students, we ought to also bear in mind, this is not only solution to get best result. Therefore, we should consider other kinds of problems which affect on education system. \n       In a nutshell, based on the above-mentioned point such as, quality of educations system not only interests with mix-education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned. It is personally concluded that this kinds of developments will be put into the action for all schools shortly.\n         \n", "id": "1-35940", "cefr": "A2.ii", "edits": [[0, [[90, 122, null], [146, 159, "words"], [213, 222, "all"], [335, 343, null], [367, 371, ""], [385, 395, "it is also"], [431, 437, ""], [440, 444, ""], [474, 477, "plays"], [488, 492, "role"], [495, 499, ""], [512, 516, "its"], [545, 550, "standard"], [553, 553, " the"], [554, 564, "education"], [609, 611, "throughout"], [625, 634, "educational"], [656, 656, ","], [754, 758, "get"], [795, 802, null], [854, 859, ""], [970, 970, " a"], [1012, 1012, " be"], [1031, 1040, "authorities"], [1055, 1055, " be"], [1066, 1071, " to"], [1083, 1092, "efficiently"], [1111, 1114, "methods"], [1121, 1129, null], [1143, 1143, " insufficient"], [1221, 1229, null], [1235, 1239, ""], [1296, 1303, "employing"], [1376, 1376, " their"], [1377, 1383, "studies"], [1394, 1397, "jobs"], [1419, 1425, ""], [1471, 1471, ","], [1480, 1480, ","], [1498, 1498, " a"], [1504, 1515, "developed"], [1516, 1521, null], [1545, 1553, "countries"], [1598, 1604, "motivate"], [1604, 1608, ""], [1609, 1616, "students"], [1647, 1653, ""], [1706, 1706, " the"], [1727, 1727, " the"], [1807, 1810, " the"], [1881, 1886, "points,"], [1894, 1895, " the"], [1906, 1906, " the"], [1907, 1917, "education"], [1934, 1943, null], [1949, 1962, "mixed education"], [2026, 2026, " were"], [2043, 2054, ""], [2070, 2074, "these"], [2113, 2117, ""]]]], "userid": "5113"}

The reasons for this as follows.\nLearn how to walk before learn how to run, the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue. Confronting with challenges, primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one. Thus, people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later.\nNonetheless, I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children. Primary school, the best moment for learning, children are easier and faster to gain knowledge. Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school, but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life. Rather than concern about the challenges, children would confront with, it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school.\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks.

But the present we live it, we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. As far as I am concerned. I do believe that people's lives in the future will change toward the bad. No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion.\n\nFirstly, we are living in unstable world. It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier. But from life's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life. Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law, The stongest beat the weakest. To illustrate. There are a categorisation of countries, there are developed countries, emerged one and on the way of development countries. Who classified those countries like this? whare the critria of this ranking? and...\nThese questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer. Hence, The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people's lives but in negative side.\n\nIn addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed. For example. Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect. This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage. Therefore, The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present.\n \nTo summarize, People's life knows a fast change and development, but generally this evolution affecting people.

For me, as a passionated Soccer Player, it is a good Point to consider. I recommand to the Clubs, be warned. \n\nFor instance Christiano Ronaldo. For him, as one of the top sheld payed Players of european leagues, it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz. He is arrogant. He does not Need another one, but he likes the colour. This way of thining he also Shows in game time. He is not chasing after the ball, is not fighting enough to Keep  it In the case he would really Need the Money, he would behave totally different. \n\nWhat influences does this salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple. They sell the tricots for 20 Euros more per Piece than last season. By this aciton a Ronaldo or messie can be payed and it is possible to buy the best Team fo the league, like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment.\nBut consider the reaction of the fans. For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game. The tickets are to expensive. The Anger will spoil over someday. This makes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a certain Group of fans - Hooligans. \nAs a result of These Action, it is an uncertain way to go for the Clubs. If it stays on a certain Lever, no fan will complain about higher Prices. But if the Prices will be to high, no onw would visit the games anymore.

Firstly, there are a lot of methods to travel; for example, buses, trolley buses, Metro, BTS, train, ship. Secondly, public transport improve itself to be more functional and help support people. For example, comfortable seats, system support for the handicap or physical disability, time capture that help people to know the fix time when the bus come, as well as security support that help people to be more confident to travel. Lastly, public transportation make you sure to arrive on time.

Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different.\n\nIn the past, people were used to live the instant without concerning about the future. Lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future. For that, everything were kind of similar and static for many years. But then industrialization comes and with that, the technology, so ways of life's started to change and everything start to go faster.\n\nAs I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. For example, sharing knowledge and experiences allows that everybody can do or apply things and develops faster. Also allows that researches can be share easily or for example you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as we'll so you can react faster and make some changes.\n\nAnother example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life.

{"text": "Recently, an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenient. In my opinion, public transport will still exist in the society. There are three main reasons for supporting my idea. Firstly, for the long-distance, the car is not as convenient as airport. for example, if you go to another city by car, you may spent more than two days on the way. On the contrary, airport just cost your two hours, and you can go to your destination. The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car. Secondly, consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country. The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people. Thus, it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car, and everyone can consume.Thirdly, the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth. Air pollution is the main causes for global warming. The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution, and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution.

{"text": "Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time. In Korean, people should completed military service at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan. It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old. With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity\uff0cwhilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice.\n\nFirstly\uff0cevery countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security. If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country\uff0cthey can not get help from other countries immediately. Therefore\uff0cpeople accept military service could be easier to protect their country. Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country. \nSecondly, the important for people become maturity when they completed military service, which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old. In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills\uff0cpeople also can improve personal quality in military service. Consequently\uff0cpeople could be more independent and strong\uff0cthey seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly to improve physical\uff0chowever study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere\uff0cpeople usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished. \n\nAdditionally, critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service. Relatively some people unwilling join military service\uff0cpeople volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it. Furthermore\uff0cit also can respect for right s of people\uff0cespecially for women who do not can adapt the hard training.  \n\nIn conclusion, it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves.

{"text": "In the past, cars are only affordable for the upper level while for the middle class and lower there are not many choice for them beside walk and public transportation. Since technology and standard of living are improved, many people left the traditional habit in using public transportation and choosing car for several reasons. The first one is to preserve time. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. Secondly, public transportation usually very crowded and make us not feel safe since there is an opportunity for us to be theft. Then by car we can enjoy the scenery, share laugh, change our destination by sudden and many more. For these reasons, it cannot be doubted if people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation.\n\nSince cars are affordable nowadays, a family can have more than one that make the number of car growing rapidly but they do not think further about the negative side effects that a car has. Firstly, it leading us to global warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in many countries, moreover actually it is not only leading but also make global warming faster and also can threat our health. Then roads are more crowded right now and there are so many traffics so people wasted longer time in the road, then it makes one of the positive points of using a car is gone and the importance of public transportation is needed. While in the statement is written that public transportation will be left by many people, in my opinion is the opposite that public transportation is our future. It can be proved by now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher, beside it is not as costly as using a car, the quality of public transportation are improved so citizen have no worry using it.\n", "id": "1-338786", "cefr": "A2.ii", "edits": [[0, [[18, 21, "were"], [52, 57, "classes,"], [101, 104, "were"], [114, 120, "choices"], [130, 136, "besides"], [137, 141, "walking"], [169, 174, "Once"], [189, 189, " the"], [262, 264, "of"], [297, 305, "chose the"], [351, 359, "save"], [376, 376, ","], [399, 402, "is"], [423, 430, "get to"], [431, 438, "all our"], [452, 456, "and"], [460, 465, "forces"], [477, 479, "at"], [485, 493, "stops"], [499, 509, ".

When I live in university, my life has become change a lot of. Firstly, studying is very difficult because you have to accept new ways of studying- studying by myself. In addition, my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English, which I can\u2019t catch up on lessons well in the first time. I was very inconfident about myself and i can\u2019t make friends well so I think that it\u2019s too difficult to ask teachers or friends. I  always try to find out reasons which take a lot of time. Moreover, I need to improve my skills such as reading, listening, writing, and speaking, they help me to catch up on my teacher\u2019 s lesson. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they \u2018re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. It\u2019s not convenient. Everyday, I have to clean our room , wash clothes, I must take a lot of time to finish  everything before I star learning. The first time living here, i used to called my family and complained about here\u2019s life. However, life\u2019s university have many conveniences. Living alone, I have to manage money well. Before I want to pay money for something, I always think carefully that I\u2019m really necessary or not. Sometimes, I broke up nearly and I was really worried so I have to pay money suitably. When I living alone, I have to save money because there are many situations which I have to slove without family, and you can become a good person with many good characters such as confident, independent, friendly. Because my family always prepared everything for me when I lived with them so it\u2019s very difficult to be independent. But today, I have to do it , I have to solve my problem, manage money, wash clothes by myself. In addition, I  can be confident because teachers require everybody in class have to stand in front of class and speak English. Living alone you have to make friends when you\u2019re sad.

{"text": "Last Friday I\u2019ve visited Balla without any planning. I usually wake up at 10 am at that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla with them. He usually avoids me in this kind situation. Nowadays he treats me as botheration. That is why I was very surprised. The reason he told me to go Balla is Noman will feel alone there as Badhon and her mother is not going. I was in a bit hesitation latter decide to go. Actually I don\u2019t have enough courage to say no to my father. I got ready very quickly so I didn\u2019t do my morning exercises.\nWe have been told earlier that Abul kaka has got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from office nonetheless the performance of the vehicle was awful that day. It shut down at the road for several times while we were on the way. So I was feeling very anxious that if the car fail in Aricha highway. Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman will prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in hi-ways for many reasons. Those are the most risky roads of the country. if there is an alternate way I always use that. That\u2019s why when I go to village I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA-ARICHA highway. My father also uses this road. When I was a youngster, my father and I rode motorcycle to visit our place using this road. As I was a kid I fall asleep sometimes. May be for that I have a high regard for the road.\nnoman engaged the front seat. Though he was unwilling to sit there as because abul kaka or my father should be seated there. But they insist him. So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably. When the car stopped to take oil at a service station near Gilando, my father asked me to go the very back benches of the jeep. I thought I shouldn\u2019t come as because those benches were disgraceful for me. I feel like I\u2019m depriving by my family. If I were in a better position it could not happen to me. Peoples humiliate me in many ways because I do nothing for earnings. I found it very painful when my parents do it to me. I keep my brain cool and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself. I know who I am and what I\u2019m doing. My thoughts are unquestionably better than others. Hence I\u2019m waiting for good time. \nWe reached our home at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm. It gives the impression that only going and coming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour. That was ridiculous. That the I spent most of my time with Noman with his over talking habit. My usual stance with this kind of person is to listen. We visited nagar chak with much anticipation. In this season I kike to see the sun shine. The crystal clear and mild sun is very favorite of mine. While I was listening noman I was discerning  that I should question more. When he talks he has done many mistakes because of his over talking habit. \nat 4:00 pm we set for Dhaka was an early move because of faulty car. I fall asleep as soon as we crossed jhitka bazar in addition when I wake up we had crossed Tora bridge. We stopped our car to a road side tea stall to take tea. Than we set for Dhaka. We talked about a lot of things. When we talked to our seniors I think I should control myself though they talked unreal things. They prefer industrialization over nature. At the same time they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in our time. A never ending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka.\n", "id": "1-113861", "cefr": "A2.i", "edits": [[0, [[13, 16, ""], [79, 79, ", but"], [80, 82, "on"], [141, 141, " to"], [192, 192, " of"], [212, 212, ","], [229, 240, null], [290, 294, "asked"], [303, 303, " to"], [310, 312, "was because"], [319, 323, "would"], [329, 334, "lonely"], [366, 368, "were"], [382, 405, "was hesitant but"], [406, 412, "later"], [413, 419, "decided"], [435, 435, ","], [438, 440, "did"], [553, 557, "had"], [591, 594, "had"], [627, 627, " the"], [634, 646, ".

On Sunday, my family and I went to Causeway Amador then to Albrook Mall.\n\nAfter the examns finished, I went home and had nothing to do, so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week I haven't watch them due to the exam week.

We began to solve it again and took us the whole week to finish it. While solving the puzzle, I decided to count how much pieces was left, after counting them I realized that five pieces were missing. I was too angre because I was finishing the puzzles and five pieces were missing so I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but didn't find it. On Saturday, I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing but I was happy too. I finished it.\n\nOn Sunday, my father planned to take my whole family to Causeway Amador. Also my uncle, aunt, grandfather and cousins went with us. After arriving to the Causeway, my brother and my cousins went to drive bicycle for one hour. I was hoping that my father can teach me to drive the car but was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father didn't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me drive.\n\nMini vacation can be fun but sometimes boring because you haven't planned anything for the vacation.

{"text": "First of all, I disagree with that statement, because of these reasons I am about to give. Once we stop using Public transport, it is going to causes problems. For example, if we completely relaying to use cars it is going to increase the gasoline uses. Apparently it is going to make more pollution more global warming issue. How ever, using cars makes the life easier but when everyone or every house they will own at least three cars it is too much. Although the traffic jams the accidents etc.. . \n\n public transport it is really important and it has a lot of advantages for helping humanity. In my opinion every country they should have different kind of public transport \nbuses, subways , and trains.

{"text": "In the argument, the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. The author claimed that the business dropping causes by the increasing number of skateboarded users. Likewise, the skateboarded users brought numerous garbage that affects the stores in the plaza. Based on author\u2019s two concern, the statement that drew a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision.\nFirst of all, it is a contradiction in the argument. If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza, there are more customers to help the growth of business. It is against author\u2019s assertion. From this point view, the decreasing of business should cause by other factors, but not skateboarded users. However, there are many reasons can cause the business dropping. Probably, the stores are too old in Central Plaza which could not attract customers walk into, and have to renovate. Furthermore, the produce sales in the stores that couldn't fit customers\u2019 need. Those above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly. \nSecond, author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person, whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing. Those problems appeal that there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza. \nMoreover, the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users take over pedestrian walking space. To solve this problem, the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding, and divide the different space for walking and skateboarding.\nTo sum it up, the author\u2019s prediction won\u2019t happen if the city prohibits skateboarding.

On the other hand, the author should provide profound discussion why people come to Central Plaza don\u2019t shop there.

{"text": "I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons.\n     First, this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable. Kids around these age (2 to 5 years old) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed. One of them was \"the ultimate max steel\" which was about a hundred dollars.\n     Secondly, I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child's relationships. It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened with/to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia. One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, do not speaking well with her for three weeks!\n    In conclusion, I am strongly favourable to this statement. Advertisement for young kids, not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them.
