Similarly, people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses.\nTo conclude, the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it.

We discovered our fascination with food and \u2018The Puerquitour\u2019 was born. Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began.\nThe first day started in an important date\u2026 Taco Day! Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions, accompanied by cold beers. \nDue to Puerquitour is something to share, the second day we shared it with Diana, one of my friends from Vancouver. Again we ate tacos, but this time they were special. The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there. It means that they have different taste of tortillas \u2013vanilla, strawberry, chipotle, nopal, and walnut, among others- and salsas \u2013tamarind, guava, mango, guacamole, etc. That day did not finish with the tacos, after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes. \nThird day was one of my favourite, the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s. La Papa Guapa, which is located in La Condesa, offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks. Totally recommended!    \nMar Azul Resturant, in the north of Mexico City, was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour. Seafood is delicious there, my recommendations are breaded shrimp, fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water.\nFifth day, it was time to eat more tacos, the place?\u2026 El asadero Hidalguense. You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself, it is just too much for one person, so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did. Don\u2019t forget to ask for a litter of beer.\nAlmost a week in the Puerquitour. The sixth day was to celebrate Magda\u2019s final test, a friend from high school, who already presented it to get the Master Degree; and the farewell of Vicente, who is already at the USA, and that I will go to the UK. Because we like the food, we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub. You can\u2019t go there and don\u2019t eat memelas, that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious. The dessert? Ice cream in Tepoznieves.\nBecause Vic was almost with a foot in the USA, we spent all day together. Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast, gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea. Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown. The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it, but that day it was closed; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer. \nThe last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert, a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything. I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love. \nDon\u2019t forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour!!!\n", "cefr": "C1.ii", "id": "1-37034"}

This kid has been raised by his sister, a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband. Sadly, Pip has no fortune in any possible way. Moreover, he is just a regular kid with a terrible life. Beside this, Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid. He does not use complex words when he talks, but he uses them when he narrates. Also, his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents. Obviously, nobody would like to live his life, but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and, finally, like him. At least, I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending. He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister.\nNevertheless, the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader. Actually, the narrator is our protagonist, but telling the story as an adult. And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words, but with actions. The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name. \nAlso, the narrator mainly uses direct speech, but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words. This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter, where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file, and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could, and he would come to the thief at the Battery. Apart from this, he just writes exactly what the characters said. The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view. He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it, but he does not have any omniscient power. However, his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too.  Also, he describes his parents in a hilarious way, imaging his father as a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone. These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text, accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters, when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself.\nBeside this, the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy, living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist, with the exception of Joe. The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters, he focuses on their appearance. Actually, we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house. The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother. And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going and foolish, but that is all we know about them. Also, the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes. In fact, the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences, with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures. This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator, but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences. For instance, here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter:\n\u201cMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up \"by hand.\" \nHaving at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the dialogues are simple and shorter:\n\n\"Now lookee here,\" he said, \"the question being whether you're to be let to live. You know \nwhat a file is?\"  \n\"Yes, sir.\"  \n\"And you know what wittles is?\"  \n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMoreover, the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said. Pip uses a rich vocabulary, using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things. The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example. Regardless, the dialogues are written exactly as they were said. The thief said \u201cWho d\u2019ye with?\u201d This is written as it is said, making it more realistic.\n\nNotwithstanding, the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist. The events are narrated in a mysterious way, telling us what happened in a realistic story-line without flashback. The story is narrated as it happens. The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief. Also, the slow rhythm is adequate. The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters, but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text. The thief disappears, but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting.\n\nTherefore, I do not know how the story will end. Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters. All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending. Probably, the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster. I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts, at the graveyard. Like another brick in the wall, another tombstone in the graveyard. I would like to read a story without tale, just a regular man who died while he was learning to live. Obviously, this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing. This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid. Consequently, reading these chapters is a pleasure, but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or, what is more, what the author is trying to transmit. If the story has a happy ending, then the central theme could be getting over adversities; if not, it is a sad story.\n", "cefr": "C1.ii", "id": "1-104967"}

Even though it was illegal, the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding, her biological mother. A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number. She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother\u00b4s rejection. After a few seconds, a woman picked up the phone. At the beginning Anna did not say anything, she could not utter any sound. But then she said \"hello, my name is Anna and I think you are my mother\". After another few seconds of silence, Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions. They agreed to meet the next day in the park. She was going to have so many answers to so many questions. Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day.

Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young\u2019s minds. In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided.\nFrom one point of view, top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons. Firstly, watching the success of such athletes, teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports. This means they will want to play sports, which is essential for their health. Secondly, doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons, such as discipline and dealing with success and failure. The importance of working hard to achieve goal\u044b and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen. This is a good example for youngsters to follow.\nFrom another perspective, sometimes professional athletes are not good role models. Firstly, sport has become business. Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame. This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition. Secondly, there are those athletes who behave disgustingly. For example, some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost. It goes without saying, that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young.\nIn conclusion, there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people. On balance, I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth, as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports.    \n", "cefr": "C2.i", "id": "1-164820"}

Plus, he's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago. He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department. In his eyes, what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences, so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job.\n  I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you.

Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration, mining, production and distribution of shale gas. We cannot ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs. Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad, there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in  gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere. According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure, there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well. The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas", "cefr": "C2.i", "id": "1-41802"}

In my personal experience, I believe that it's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life.\nIt's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam. For example, one year ago, I had my final surgery exam. I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice. The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months. For the hard work and perfect discipline, I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals. If I hadn't had such an organized plan, I would never have got such a perfect score.\nAnother thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night. It's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching. What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam. For example, I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam. Two days before my exam, I realized that I ran out of time. I had insomnia the night of my exam, it wasn't enough that I wasn't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously. Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores.\nMoreover, if I aim at getting high scores, I assert that memorizing the details is important.\nIf you don't start studying before exam with an appropriate time, you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject, but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word. That will help you a lot even if you don't get the chance to revise everything before your exam. I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details. In the exam, I had that question where it required describing a concept; amazingly, I was able to do it perfectly. Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times, I was able to remember it. It was just flooding without so much effort. So, for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam.\nIn sum, I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared. If you want to get high scores and perform greatly, you should start studying from day one if possible. Don't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at?\n", "cefr": "C1.ii", "id": "1-45585"}

Firstly, the rate of interest is by 3.1%, which is quite good. Additionally, if you open a saving account in that bank, you will get a diary as a gift. And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card. Unfortunately, the bank doesn't have branches in Britain. And all banking operations must be done by phone.\nThe second bank, Royal Savings Bank, has many branches in the UK (over 650), so you can make all bank operations on spot. But there is a service charge for owning a credit card (\u00a312 per year). You do also get a gift as a new account holder, a full set of saucepans (do you really need it?).\nAll in all, I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank, since the rate of interest is higher and you don\u2019t need to pay any annual charges.

Czech universities provides high standards of education, internationally recognized degrees, modern campuses with outstanding facilities, safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity.

They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them. It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter. Dog's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people's  face. And that is what they are there for, to make people happy.\nThese hairy four-legged animals are also very protective.

I'm settled back home and I'm up and running, even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst. Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches, so ever since then it's going better. Furthermore, precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions! So I should be back on jumping around in no time :).\n\nAs you know, Malta was a big punch right in the stomach, which for sure I didn't need! :(. The course and the organization left much to be desired; and as if that weren't enough, my scholarship (funny enough not the ones of the (only!) TWO other participants), was not sufficient to cover all the costs! :/ Anyway, CS and magic saved me right at the last second (the last night), and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart. And for that I want to THANK YOU once again.\n\nBack home, everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now, shouldn't I??-. So I hadn't have time for much. I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine. He decided to finish the second half without my help, so that was a bit disappointing, both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations* and for the (I'm guessing, as I don't know anything as yet :/) less money earned that it will mean.\n\n*Sorry, I'm gonna (ab)use of your native language skills once again: here \"not meeting his expectations\", could be substituted by another expression. What I doubt is the difference between this bunch: be good enough, measure up, make the grade; be up to standard/the task.\n\nThere again, having a whole bunch of free hours (days! From Sunday to Tuesday) for myself that I was not counting on, proved itself to make wonders!!! I decided to get back home (I had been the whole week at my friend's place, as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer's house, where I had been going every day last week), and I started getting things done. Plus I gave a rest to my ankle, which was very much needed too!\n\nThe two-day one-night trip with my mother and sister went quite well. The place we were visiting was very beautiful, and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle, we would have gone for a short hike.\n\nTomorrow I'll be starting my first English class, which has taken much longer than I had plan. I have sent a lot of CVs, and have gone to 3 interviews so far, also for English classes (one company and two academies).\n\nAbout the pictures from Ramla, could you wait a bit more time? I haven't find time to download the pictures (from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out, I was (and is) definitely NOT a priority. Do remind me again, thou, if you see that I'm forgetting, okay? (Please!).\n\nDid you ask Mario about the speakers? Because chatting is way faster than writing ;).\n\nI'm gonna go now.

Referring to scientists at the British Met Office, 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming \u2013 which will lead to unknown consequences on the future.\nThe World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels. These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks. Then, world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon. \nStephen Belcher, director of the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre, claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change, Amber Rudd, who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays\u2019 politics due to its consequences on economy, global security and the fight against poverty. She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role-model for other countries.\nFurthermore, climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming, clarifying this statement with the example of Central England, which has warmed 20% more than the global average. Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding, heatwaves, water stress and loss of harvests. Facing these consequences, a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher. \nDespite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008, there is only a small chance of 5-10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd, University of Leeds, as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies.\nAlthough the NASA study shows a different result, the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions, environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris.\n", "cefr": "C1.ii", "id": "1-325739"}

Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in, and who experiences them, they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration. To be included on the World Heritage List, properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria.\nThe World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world. It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history.\nWorld Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.\nThe site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located, but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations. Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole.\nAnother advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention, and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation. Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\nThe Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they can't protect them for risks. Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance.\nIn my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO.

Unlike popular understandings of History (and even presumably scientific ones, I must say), History is not an unstoppable march towards \"progress\", whatever that word means. It is a ciclical process. Rome had its hayday in the first century AD, but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past. Those later period Romans weren't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier. And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take  for granted? No one can assure such a thing. But I don't think, unless there's another World War, people's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years. I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak, and after that there will be a decline, until a new Dark Ages. But let's pick the World War hypothesis for a second. A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now. But there's, at this day, prospects for a new World War? I don't think so, but on the other hand what the hell do I know? The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know, and no one, or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it. One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed, and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another, but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war  against each other would have its roots in  much older times. As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War, a Third, hypothetical war, could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have  happenned already. \n But let's not digress into that, that's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition.

I really hope that you have a nice welcome and, please, feel at home. Here, in Mallorca, there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place, without tourists, noise and crowded beaches. \nOn the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Art\u00e0. In the municipality of Art\u00e0 you will find a coaster town, situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant. Sa Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village. Nowadays, you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore. Here your adventure starts. In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view. You will ride until Ca los cans, one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca. This zone is part of a protected area, a natural park. For that reason, you must go riding a bike or walking. As Machado said \u201cse hace camino al andar\u201d. It means that the most important is the way, the journey. Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life. On the way to Ca los cans, you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation. There are a lot of trees called \u201ctamarells\u201d, native trees of the coast of Mallorca. Moreover, you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored. \nFinally, you will get to Ca los Cans. It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels. There you can practise different sports. It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes, sea urchins and seaweed. There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea. \nA part from sports, you should note two different culture points. On the one hand, there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms. On the other hand, there is a prehistorical tower called \u201cTalaiot\u201d. The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet. Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high-class people.\nIt is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down. The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic (especially if you are with your partner) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana. From that seashore you can see all the Alc\u00fadia bay, part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor. \nCa los Cans is a mixture of sea, nature and culture. I am sure that you will like it and, of course, I need to ask you a favour: Please, keep the secret.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaula.\n", "cefr": "C1.i", "id": "1-2785"}

This report analyses the two main facilities: the gym and the swimming pool.\n\nThe gym.\n\nThe machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer. On the other hand, the gym is too small. Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise.\n\nThe swimming pool.\n\nIt is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length, about 20 metres. Furthermore, it is not too deep, so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim. On the other hand, the changing rooms are too far from this facility, so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another.\n\nConclusions.\n\nThe facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger. Furthermore, you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool.\n", "cefr": "C2.i", "id": "1-23279"}

As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars. A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others. Travalling by car is also much more convenient. Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end?\nIn my opinion, it is not true. Firstly, there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car. Students, children from large families, old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time. \nSecondly, cars can also turn into public transport. Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely. Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees. \nThirdly, people do not have an inborn driving skill, so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation. This is also true for older people, who lose the ability to drive as they age. \nIn conclusion, public transportation is not likely to disappear, at least during the nearest tens of years.\n", "cefr": "C1.i", "id": "1-114249"}
