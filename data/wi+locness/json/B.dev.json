He said he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying. Then he hugged her. He said he loved her and kissed her forehead. He had to stay with her because of... the baby.

The colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised.

They were not only really clever people but also excellent co-workers. Working collaboratively is, in fact, the most interesting way of learning any subject even English.\nSecond, the teachers were really good skills to teach. They managed to encourage all of us every day. This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level.\nThird, phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy. They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course.\nHowever, in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher\u2019s team. This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising.\nTo wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year.\nYours sincerely,\nJuan Orozco\n"}

To be honest, I am not sure.\nAlthough privately oned cars are more and more popular, and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries, it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future.\nMost people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution. Carbon based fuels will not last forever. I would say that most probably private care are not \"sustainables\" in the long term, and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport. \nThe population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings. I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around, each of them with its own private small helicopter. But it is not going to happen. I guess that in our future there are no helicopters, and not even cars. \nStates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative.

Students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation, students will not remember the knowledge they have learned, partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study, and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying. Therefore, I agree with the statement that students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying. More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs.\n  To begin with, there is a general consensus, students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time. For example, on history class, history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester. It is very wasting time and not efficient.\n  Next to go would be, students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation. For example, when the semester start, students cannot get away from the sunshine, beach, and travelling. In the class, students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher.\n  Last but not least, some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time. For instance, learning English should be a daily education, if you have a long time without learning English, you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar.\n  In a nutshell, based on aforementioned, I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying."}

In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor. \nPeople say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip: arrived, get away to the frustration of an unknown place, get alone with your trip companion, success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal. In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion. This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city. As an example, if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip, exchange some pictures, eat together, and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls. \nOther advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food. Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country.  For example, there are a lot of American people that doesn\u00b4t like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food. As  advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper. In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country. \nIn conclusion, I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country: Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious!\n"}

SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages, and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds. Unsurprisingly, social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication, regardless of distance or time. However, people who use Facebook, Twitter or SMS in general, are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying. This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter, and also comments potential future of these implications.\n\nCommunicating can be achieved, regardless of distance, through Facebook and Twitter. The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers. Firstly, Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood, and in where their negative feelings are expressed. Secondly, Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends, making observations of relationships, maintaining one\u2019s own feeling within the network (through wall posts, pokes, messages, etc) (Oldmeadow, Quinn, & Kowert, 2013). That is to say, human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood, and receiving responses. Thirdly, Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business. Knowledge about the members increases continually, and moreover, maintaining relations with other existing members, and also sharing their same interests by the social network. (Emerald Group Publishing, 2013). Finally, people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter. For instance, by following famous celebrities, people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them. However, due to this, people who are being followed, or users in general, may have less personal privacy, and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone.\n\nHowever, information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible, therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion. However, information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible, therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion. Mostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing. In fact, along with agreeable and pleasant comments, there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment. First of all, people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person. For example, after the premier of The Hunger Game was released, a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person (Rauch and Schanz, 2013). Because of the accessible information through SMS, it has led to many problems involve with cycle-bullying, cycle-badgering, cycle-stalking behaviour (Krishna, as cited in Williams & Merten, 2008). For example, Krishna et al.(2013) reports a case of  continuous disturbing a woman from a man called  Mr.X \u201cadmitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment, trespassing and telephone harassment\u201d (pp. 576.e1-576.e2).\n\n Potentially, Facebook and Twitter, and SMS in general, may replace face to face communication and improve their functions, because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances. Therefore, it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second, rather than have to call them. The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS, the less communicate skills that they have. In addition, to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts, Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem. For example, controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options. However, despite the useful of these implications, people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently. Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel. In contrast, because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide, which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible. Possibly, users might express aggressive toward each other, because of lack of privacy.\n"}

Furthermore, elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands. The Egyptians called their country `Black Land` to mark it off of the red soil of desert. Nowadays, deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt. Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to dry or wet period. They knew when it will be the `Green Nile` or `Red Nile` to stock up with clean water. But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive. The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals. Anyway, a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink.

In addition to this, people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays. Therefore, it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people. In holidays, people can away from daily problems and also can  take more time with their friends and family. In this respect, many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives. For example, walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions. On the one hand, holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life. People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful. For instance, in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future. Besides, people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces. The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love, helping people or thinking spiritual things. It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings. For example, people meet their relatives that never see for a long time. At the same time, people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls. They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people. When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy. Because people need to leave the material world. In holidays, people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life. In conclusion, holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions. Also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects."}

Firstly, it reduces traffic jams, noise and pollution, as well as it lowers CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it turns out to be the quickest method of transport. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads. Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car. Another disadvantage is the weather. Getting wet when it rains, having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind, freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather. \n\nIn my point of view, Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity. \n"}

For example, people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway. And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays, due to less frequent schedule. Also, we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach. When the bus is crowded, we have to stand, making us more exhausting especially for a long distance. Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above, advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected.\n\nFirst, public transport is good for the environment compared to private car. As we all know, the more  public transport passengers use, the less car exhausts are emitted per person. Recently, several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers. In other words, public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life.\n\nSecond, public transport saves city spaces. As more and more people choose to live in cities, nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded. Correspondingly, the space for each person becomes more limited than before. Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance, I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting.\n\nLast but not the least, public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving. The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings, resulting in a tense spirit. For a passenger, however, travelling is a complete relax. People can listen to music, take a phone call with a friend, read a fascinating book or just loot at outside. \n\nThough there are many advantages for public transport, it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation. E.g., it offers less flexibility than cars, and is less environment friendly than bicycles.  Therefore, it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others. It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one."}

When we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us. Some of them started design the stage, some of them checking songs volume and lights. My job was checking songs list which singers would perform. I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers. They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list. On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly. Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it. Finally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars. It is difficult to explain that feeling.

In this report we will see some characteristics of today's television.\nNumber of Channels are gradually reducing\nIn our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived, a lot of new channels flourished. All tv tried to get several licences to distribute their shows. In order to resolve some deficits budgets, today there are mainly two TV groups. Less channels means less choices.\n\nInternet TV is increasing\nIt costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment, where and with who watching  this or that televison program. You just follow a suggestion made bay someone. You just click on it.\n\nThey have to reduce their budget\nDespite of changing channels we see the same news. Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them. It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world. It is cheaper to buy it.\n\nSummary\nTV is dying. It is hard to compete with the Internet. Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match. Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit. However the fact is that there is a countdown on them. "}

Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive. That is why because the cost of petrol, diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world. While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways:\n1. People can save the money they spend on petrol.\n2. As they have specific routes across the country ,town ,city and villages, it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc.\nI disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society, the rich and the poor. Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day. It is because of high taxes on goods.

The cars need to be repaired; besides, if you have a car, you have to pay some taxes. In addition, these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city.\n\nSecondly, another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted. If you use the public transport, you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport.\n\nFinally, the last reason is the comfort because you have a car; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city. Besides in some cities, car cannot be parked in some places, such as: the old city and the city centre.\n\nSumming up, people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car. From my point of view, I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country.\n"}

Climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then. Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live. Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders. If these challenges are not addressed in coming years, imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult.

As a result, our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it.\nThe local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports. That's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas.\nFinally,the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need. In fact, around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the  yellow, green and blue containers in every street.

I didn\u2019t knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone, now I have to find my parents. I think the reason why I didn't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it\u2019s not that beautiful so you can't distinguish were does the explosion hit .  Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food, I was starving to death so I ate a lot. We made some incentives about laws, but it was a total conflict, because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow. I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping. So everybody is gonna try to enforce the laws. In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us. In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises.  I stalked him and it seemed that this guy has a hump. I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group. We were talking about this when a dog just came near; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature. He bit my leg and it hurt a lot, we tried to alert the others but it was too late, it was the group or us. We saw that beast eating our friends and the food. In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival. But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this."}

Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing, though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling. This composition will explain the two different opinions. \n\nFirstly, the car is more convenient because there is privacy. Also, unlike public transport such as buses and underground, you have much more comfort and speed. There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice.\nOn the website of The Scottish Government (publication \"Young people and transport\"), a 12-14 years old boy explain \u00ab - I prefer going in the car, it's quicker...There's not as many people around you... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well. \u00bb\nAlthough they are many positive points about private cars, they are also negative ones. Indeed, cars increases the pollution, you have traffic congestion, and it is very expensive. \u00ab - On my wage, even the driving lessons are expensive. Then just owning a car and looking after your car, insurance, tax, etc. Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh, but I don't work in Edinburgh.\u00bb says a 17-22 years old boy. \n\nNow, secondly, travelling by public transport is cheaper (we don't pay any fees on public transport, but also, it is safer, According to The Saigon Times, there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars. The main reason is that the cars' owners are drunk when driving. It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank,it would not have as much accidents.\n\nFinally, many developed countries on the world,such as England, America, Canada, Japan and so on, have built a public transport system, so the traffic jam have been decreased. As a result, the economy has been increasing. From this analysis, it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important.\n"}

Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship, always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others' feelings and is unwise. Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer. It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment.\nTo further illustrate the first point above, could hurt one's feelings by telling the truth at all time. For example, if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion. People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings. Instead of doing so, people may praise her with other things on her. In that case, they could still make conversions without boiling her mood.\nThe other point is when it comes to personal matters, people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted. If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know, they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much. If I was having a day off to go to a doctor, I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run.These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not."}

Unfortunately, this is a part of celeb's 'work' so they have to take into account. But on the other hand, there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time. This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal, not famous people. I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids. To my mind, they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts\n\nSo, as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people,who are recognizable, deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them.\n"}

He has no idea how he ended up there.However, he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp, which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze. The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze. He took the role of a runner, the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place. Still, they only have the daylight time to explore the maze, as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous.\n\nThe film keeps getting better and better as you watch it, having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent."}
